but the vast majority show remorse or regret their actions. One in 100 people display patterns of self-centered, arrogant thinking and behavior, which is diagnosed as narcissistic personality disorder (NPD). There are thought to be a similar number of people who are psychopathic.Refusal to wear a facemask linked to sociopathy | News | The Times"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab90c5d63951a69dde6856c49504ccab6aa5beab/0_0_3500_2489/master/3500.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97cf90c77dfe142987229c0029f7e9d7","title":"thomas piketty refuses to censor latest book for sale in china","story":"French economist admired by Xi Jinping says he will not cut sections on inequality in ChinaThe latest book by the French economist Thomas Piketty appears unlikely to be sold in mainland China after he refused requests to censor it.The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has expressed admiration for Piketty’s work, but Capital and Ideology, which was published last year, has not made it to the mainland China market due to sections on inequality in the country.Piketty told the  the Chinese publisher Citic Press had sent his French publisher a list of 10 pages of requested cuts in June from the French edition of the book, and a further list in August related to the English edition.“I refused these conditions and told them that I would only accept a translation with no cut of any sort. They basically wanted to cut almost all parts referring to contemporary China, and in particular to inequality and opacity in China,” he said.“Other Chinese publishers who have been in touch with my French publisher Le Seuil also said there would be cuts, so at this stage it looks as if the book will not be published in mainland China.”Citic Press told the South China Morning Post that negotiations on the copyright of the book were still under way.Censorship in China is widespread and applies to books, news websites (including the ), pop culture, and huge swathes of the internet and online platforms.Xi has previously referenced Piketty’s work, including his book Capital in the Twenty-First Century. As recently as this month, Xi wrote in an essay that Piketty’s work on US inequality was “worthy of our consideration”.“Just because Xi has personally cited Piketty’s last book doesn’t mean Piketty’s not subject to vetting,” said Dali L Yang, professor of political science at the University of Chicago, who focuses on modern Chinese politics.Xi has vowed to eradicate rural poverty by the end of 2020 – an ambitious goal even before the economic damage of the coronavirus pandemic – but also seeks to present China as a prosperous society.The passages highlighted by the Chinese publishers include one referring to the post-communism societies of regions including China becoming “hypercapitalism’s staunchest allies”, as a direct consequence of “the disasters of Stalinism and Maoism”.“So great was the communist disaster that it overshadowed even the damage done by the ideologies of slavery, colonialism, and racialism and obscured the strong ties between those ideologies and the ideologies of ownership and hypercapitalism – no mean feat,” Piketty writes in the book.Yang said Piketty’s high profile meant he was probably under even more scrutiny by censors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9a5527ed8e46c7a2f669736644596caa496238f/0_166_5757_3454/master/5757.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bceed1cc6320739c6c69e10f7dae0f21","title":"businesses and customers share your experiences of eat out to help out","story":"We’d like to hear to from staff, owners and customers on how they feel the scheme has beenThe government’s ‘eat out to help out’ scheme has meant more than 64m meals have been claimed since the beginning of August.When introduced, its aim was to incentivise the public to dine at restaurants by allowing customers to claim a half-price discount up to a cost of £10.

There have been demonstrations at Whole Foods across the country in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and the company has been quick to take corrective action against those involved,” said the worker who provided the documents, but requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. The documents claim attorney-client privilege in asking managers not to post, print or distribute them outside of leadership.Amazon has been criticized by activists for claiming to support BLM while supporting business practices that they claim perpetuate the status quo, working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and selling controversial facial recognition software to police forces. Amazon implemented a one-year moratorium on police use of its artificial intelligence software, Rekognition, in June following protests.In June 2020, Whole Foods circulated a “dress code reminder” to team member leadership and obtained by the , which affirmed only name tags and approved Whole Foods and promotional buttons are permitted for team members to wear, but noted there are exceptions for union-related buttons. “Should you become aware of a TM wearing a button with a union related message, please partner with legal before addressing the TM.”In December 2019, Trump’s National Labor Relations Board reversed a 75-year precedent in ruling private sector employers are permitted to ban some union insignia.The internal documents were circulated to management as Whole Foods faced several protests among its workers around the US over the dress code policy preventing workers from wearing Black Lives Matter slogans on their masks in support of the George Floyd protests around the US that began in late May 2020. Whole Foods workers held Black Lives Matter protests in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, California, Oregon and Washington.One of the most significant protests at Whole Foods was at a store in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The store’s workers organized daily protests from the end of June and July 2020, and were sent home repeatedly by management over workers wearing Black Lives Matter slogans on their face masks.A class action lawsuit was filed in July 2020 on behalf of workers in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and other US cities who allege the company dress code policy was selectively enforced to bar workers from wearing Black Lives Matter slogans on their face masks, and claim workers were disciplined for doing so, including Savannah Kinzer, whose employment was terminated. The lawsuit has grown to represent 28 workers from nine states. Whole Foods is seeking to dismiss the lawsuit and claimed Kinzer was terminated for violating time and attendance policy.A Whole Foods spokesperson told the  in an email: “It is common practice to provide guidance for our leaders to facilitate conversations on a number of policy-related and timely topics.

If you’re feeling more laid back, you can just hit the tub and let the world scurry on by.Lough Erne Resort, County FermanaghIf you’re after absolute luxury, why not go the whole hog? The sprawling, castellated Lough Erne Resort, housed on its own 243-hectare (600-acre) peninsula between the reedy shores of Lower Lough Erne and Castle Hume Lough, just outside Enniskillen, really is the last word in refinement.Starting your day with a choice between the resort’s two world-class golf courses sounds like our kind of dilemma: the Faldo course has been represented globally by local son Rory McIlroy, who holds the course record.For those who don’t have the golf bug, take heart: with an incredible Thai spa, world-class restaurants and access to the 40-mile-long splendour of Lough Erne, you’ll be fine.If it’s good enough to host the not-unpicky G8 summit (as it did in 2013), Lough Erne Resort is sure to satisfy your own exacting standards …And those who are after quality local food won’t need to look further than the resort’s Catalina restaurant, where guests can dine in luxury after a long day of exploring.Larchfield Estate, Lisburn, County AntrimIt’s fair to say Myrtle has been around for a while, seen a few tight squeezes, and is always ready with a warm welcome for her guests. Don’t worry, she’s not an over-friendly local – Myrtle is a lovingly-restored 1952 Saurer Swiss Army truck that now serves as one of Northern Ireland’s most inspiring glamping options at the gorgeous Larchfield Estate.The accommodation is suitably cosy and stylish, equipped with a log-burning stove, sun deck and a sauna housed in its own wooden pod with bucolic views of the surrounding greenery. Rise and shine after a night with Myrtle and set off to explore the 243-hectare (600-acre) estate. Mission accomplished.Killeavy Castle Estate, County ArmaghA gothic flight of fantasy built in 1836, Killeavy Castle is both grand and cosy: it features imposing medieval-style doors and turrets, yet the restored pile makes room for just four luxurious bedrooms within its castellated walls. Wake to the view from any of its 52 windows and you’ll feel like landed gentry.Elsewhere on the estate, the original mill, gatehouse and coach house have all been converted into stylish accommodation. There’s also a high-end spa, all on 142 hectares (350 acres) in the shadow of Slieve Gullion, the tallest mountain in County Armagh.Famed for its locally sourced food, Killeavy Castle Estate provides everything from sublime seven-course tasting menus to a famously good fry-up for breakfast.That’s your morning plans sorted.Palace Street Apartments, Derry-LondonderryPass through the famed city walls at the ornate Bishop’s Gate, then hang a sneaky left, and you’ll find yourself in a barely car-width street lined on one side by the kind of Victorian red brick you’d expect to see in an adaptation of Dickens.It’s also the very fitting home of the Palace Street Apartments, a lovingly restored, three-unit, self-catering gem. Step outside in the morning and you’ll find all of Derry-Londonderry at your feet. Within the confines of the old walled city, you’re only a stroll away from the historic Guildhall (as well-known for its political history as for its appearance in Derry Girls), St Columba’s Cathedral, where the original keys of the city are held, and the Diamond war memorial.That said, dark wood, oiled leather, antique furniture and deep beds come as standard in each apartment, making going outside an optional extra.Finn Lough, County FermanaghA lot has been written about the bubble domes at the eco-conscious Finn Lough resort in Fermanagh, but nothing can prepare you for the experience of waking snug and cosy in a luxury bed, and opening your eyes to see the dawn sky straight above you.These transparent domes offer uninterrupted views of the surrounding nature alongside high-end creature comforts: four-poster beds, ensuite bathrooms, and coffee machines to ease you into the morning the right way.Once you’ve recovered from the majesty of the morning there are woodland trails to explore, on foot or cycle, and a lake to linger by. There’s also a top-tier spa for those who aim simply to “sleep well, be pampered” – and who can blame them, when your bed is this spectacular?Come on over to Northern IrelandPlan your visit to Northern Ireland with everything you need to know about things to do, where to stay and more at irelandnorthern-irelandGet advice about travelling to Northern Ireland, including the latest information on Covid-19 restrictions at nidirect.gov.ukcoronavirus"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/345c28211f4ca1ea57842a60109e9d76c3d87992/0_116_6242_3745/master/6242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b59877834e5319eb717de6309ac0365b","title":"surf cycle or hike go wild on northern irelands adventure coast","story":"Where can you hike along a world-heritage coastline, ride an Atlantic wave, then cycle around a puffin colony, all within a few miles of each other? The answer is along Northern Ireland’s Causeway CoastWhether you like to explore on foot, by bike or by water, Northern Ireland’s Causeway Coast could be the most scenic part of the UK you’ve never visited. Yet its natural attractions and ersity of landscapes make it perfect for anyone with an adventurous heart.Here we pick a few of Northern Ireland’s outdoor highlights, though the full range of opportunities extend far beyond what’s mentioned here. The best advice? Book a week and discover the possibilities for yourself.Explore by footAt the tip of Northern Ireland lies its most famous attraction – the Unesco world heritage site of the Giant’s Causeway. And there’s no better way to reach it than on foot, by following an eight-mile section of the Causeway Coast Way. Begin at picturesque Ballintoy Harbour, which Game of Thrones fans will recognise as a setting for the Iron Islands. Then head west along the signed coast path, passing sandy beaches, rock arches and a ruined clifftop castle before finishing at the Giant’s Causeway. The 40,000 interlocking basalt columns provide a fitting finale to one of the best walks in Northern Ireland.For something completely different, head to nearby Glenariff Forest Park. Set within the celebrated Glens of Antrim, the scenery here transports you to another world. Expect numerous waterfalls, wooden walkways deep within river gorges, and long-distance views along chiselled glacial escarpments. Signed hiking circuits of different lengths mean there’s a route for walkers of all abilities.Explore by bikeIf two wheels are your thing, Rathlin Island offers an outing that will remain etched in your memory for years to come. Lying six miles off the coast, the trip begins with a ferry ride from Ballycastle marina. You’ll need to bring your own bike due to Covid-19 restrictions, but the island can be explored in a few hours. The highlight is the eight-mile return trip to its western tip. Here the land ends in sheer cliffs that are home to both a lighthouse and Northern Ireland’s largest breeding seabird colony. There’s no better way to break your ride than descending to the RSPB viewing platform and, if you’re here at the right time of year – between April and August – watching the antics of hundreds of thousands of nesting birds. Regardless of when you visit, the views remain breathtaking all year round, and the sensual assault of sound and smell makes the trip back to the harbour feel positively peaceful.For a longer journey, back on the mainland try the signed cycle route between the Giant’s Causeway and Benone. This 22-mile trip can be completed in either direction, and follows a mixture of public roads and traffic-free paths. The ride takes you through the coastal towns of Portrush, Portstewart and Castlerock, with numerous opportunities to explore sandy beaches or stop for refreshments along the way.Explore by waterAnother great option is to leave the land altogether, and explore the unique coastline from the sea. This is a shore littered with caves, arches, tunnels and cliffs, and the only way to appreciate them fully is from the water.Sea kayaking is a great option, with several local companies providing all the equipment and guidance you need to begin weaving silently between the headlands. Choose from a half-day or full-day excursion, with incredible coastal scenery interspersed by a snack or lunch in some tucked-away cove along the way.If you’d prefer to embrace the waves then there’s the chance to try surfing instead – the neighbouring towns of Portrush and Portstewart are the twin meccas for local surfers. Hire a wetsuit and surfboard from the back of the beach, book into a lesson, then hit the waves. Whether you’re a beginner or a pro, you’re guaranteed a great time, with watery thrills and spills all part of the fun.Novices and experts are also welcomed by the local sailing centres. Take a lesson or join a skippered yacht for a longer adventure, spending anything from an hour to a whole weekend on the water. With the emphasis on guests doing as much of the sailing as possible, it won’t be long before you know your jib from your gybe.Something differentOf course the activities mentioned here just scrape the surface of what’s available, and with a little imagination almost anything is possible. How about a catch-and-sea boat trip, where you start by going sea fishing, then return to watch a professional chef prepare your bounty, garnished by other local delicacies?Or a horse ride, featuring a gentle hack through the glens or an adrenaline-filled canter across the beach? Organised scuba ing, coasteering it’s all here, with countless options to suit all ages and abilities.So what’s keeping you away?

However, he needed further information in order to source and prepare for using the right personal protective equipment, for which the college was already paying “an extortionate amount”.“There’s also the question of whether we can get enough of it in time, and the need to reassure and prepare our staff, young people and their parents. We need to know the rules we will be following,” added Potter, whose school teaches 260 students with learning difficulties, from years 7 to 14.For suctioning procedures that may need to be carried out on children with cerebral palsy or chronic lung conditions, his school and others were considering FFp3 masks, which are typically used in the NHS for potentially infectious aerosol-generating procedures.“I have to to get staff fitted for them, so I need to know what sort of rules we are following, as well as can we access enough of it,” Potter said. “I cannot fathom why detailed and robust guidance is so late in coming out. My fear is that there are people who are unsure on what the guidance should be.”Jonty Clark, the chief executive of the Beckmead Trust, which specialises in support for traumatised young people with social, emotional and mental health issues as well as autism and challenging behaviour, said the sector was entering “uncharted territory”. He said “absolute terror” had been felt by many children and young people who had been deprived this year of the routine and support they relied on.Planning at the trust, which operates at eight sites in south London, and an alternative provision school in Harlow, Essex, has included increasing cleaning, shorter lessons and more breaks. But it has also had to remove tools such as Blu Tack, which is used for sensory reasons, and to halt soft play.Clark said: “A huge challenge for us also is that we have to hold the children when we do physical interventions, and some of the families we work with are quite anxious because those situations will inevitably arise.”For such interventions, the school had been advised to use visors, rather than face masks, to maintain the intuitive communication of facial expressions.“For us it’s going to be the usual cycle of anxiety for our children – just to the power of ‘N’ – because they are always anxious about coming back to school,” Clark said. “We have that ski jump every year, in terms of behavioural incidents, but we are confident we will get there.“We have a wonderful group of staff who are committed to the kids and are desperate to see them again. There’s just the unknown: how long is this going to go on for?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1764c81c8f385419243ae91263d137b964e47833/120_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80922c1a60073167bf2a1c2a266e81ea","title":"yellowstone geyser erupts giantess","story":"Giantess is one of the biggest geysers in the national park, and typically explodes between twice and six times a year In these troubled times there comes a point where we all need to let off steam.For this huge geyser in Yellowstone park, the moment was now and the eruption was spectacular, after a six-year wait.But, for the rest of us, watching this natural phenomenon is strangely meditative and beautifully distracting from much of the bad news around, despite the violent geothermal forces propelling it.Giantess Geyser spouted for the first time in more than six years in Yellowstone National Park, which straddles part of Wyoming and a little of Montana, on 25 August, according to the US National Park Service (NPS).“She” has more typically erupted between twice and six times a year in the past, according to the NPS website, and blasts a spout up to 200ft high.“The surrounding area may shake from underground steam explosions just before the initial water andor steam eruptions,” the NPS website adds.Giantess is one of the biggest geysers in the park, alongside phenomena such as the super-tall Steamboat geyser, the largest active geyser in the world, and the park’s most famous, Old Faithful, renowned for its punctual regularity as it soars from the ground around 20 times a day.Colorful hot spring features in the park include the blue-hued Morning Glory Pool and the psychedelic Grand Prismatic spring, as well as whiffy, sulfurous bubblers and roiling natural pots of scalding hot water fizzing out of the rocks.The features are among more than 10,000 hot springs and geysers in the park, a Unesco world heritage site."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b20813aa8cf6a00423b5b7e05ff2b88effb9c2b2/0_194_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c6dd4b77c0d7ae98cdfea19bea13779","title":"hundreds of thousands of chickens to be culled after covid disruption","story":"About half of staff at poultry plant in Norfolk have had to self-isolate after 75 tested positive for coronavirusAt least 400,000 chickens are being culled in the UK as Covid-19 infections disrupt slaughterhouse routines. About 300,000 birds are due to be culled in England and 110,000 have been culled in Scotland.Chickens that cannot be slaughtered for food are usually gassed with CO2 and their bodies rendered for fat and other animal byproducts. They do not enter the food chain.In England, about half of the staff at Banham Poultry in Norfolk have had to self-isolate after 75 staff tested positive for coronavirus. The plant plans “to humanely cull 300,000 birds using a gas system”, said its director, Blaine Van Rensburg, in a statement.Asked about the risk of further culls, Rensburg said: “Given we don’t know how long this current situation will last, we won’t be speculating on how many others will need to be humanely culled.”Rensburg denied earlier reports that Banham had culled about 7,000 birds. “No birds have been culled at our site to date,” he said. “We are already erting a quarter of a million birds to other suppliers and will continue to do so where possible.”In Scotland, a statement from poultry slaughterer Coupar Angus, which is owned by the 2 Sisters Food Group, confirmed that 110,000 birds had been culled. The slaughterhouse kills “almost one million chickens a week and is the only facility of its type in Scotland,” it said.There are two standard methods for gas poultry culls in the UK: whole house gassing and containerised gassing. The first involves filling the sheds where chickens live with CO2. The second involves putting the birds in specialised containers that are brought to the farm. The containers are filled with CO2 and sometimes other gasses such as argon.“Whole house slaughter is very rare, the sheds are not designed for it,” said Penny Middleton, the poultry policy manager at the National Farmers Union Scotland. “The containerised option is more controllable and would be done by someone like Livetec Systems, an approved depopulator, according to welfare regulations,” she said.No one interviewed would comment on how long gassed chickens take to die, other than to say it was legal and humane.The Coupar Angus statement said the chickens were “humanely dispatched in line with legislation” and that culls were supervised by the government’s Animal and Plant Health Agency and an independent veterinary officer.The statement said that although last week’s Covid-19 related decision to “cease production has brought many upsetting consequences” it managed “to successfully process the large majority of birds from Scotland” by sending them to other slaughterhouses in its UK network. The factory was due to reopen on Monday and no further culls are expected, it said.Middleton said the Coupar Angus plant reopening might take a while to get up to full speed, but that she was not expecting any further culls in Scotland.Peter Stevenson, a policy advisor with UK welfare organisation Compassion in World Farming, said the culls highlighted a food system failure. “Today’s chickens have been bred to grow so quickly that if they are left to continue growing after reaching their slaughter weight, many will become so lame they can barely walk, while others will die of heart disease.”The BPC’s chief executive, Richard Griffiths, said in a statement that because UK poultry processing was so efficient, with little spare capacity, losing a large slaughterhouse “will not only interrupt our national food supply, create shortages and job losses at a time when we can least afford it, but also result in bird welfare challenges on a significant scale”He said coronavirus outbreaks at meat plants demonstrated “that no amount of preparation and vigilance can guarantee complete protection against Covid-19. We have to prioritise the health of people in our community, but we also need to safeguard food supply and the welfare of our animals”.The BPC was working closely with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) “and other relevant authorities to ensure reasonable steps are put in place to minimise welfare issues and maintain food supply”, he said. “We must ensure that poultry meat plants compromised by a Covid-19 outbreak are able to maintain throughput where possible, even if it means having skeleton staff onsite.”Defra did not confirm chicken cull numbers but said birds “would be culled using gas … in line with the rules on protecting animal welfare at the time of killing.” Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

In the 90s and early 2000s, there was a modest sprinkling of romantic dramas and comedies like Love Jones, Jumping the Broom and Something New, but despite a more general resurgence of love stories in recent years, films that depict intimacy between brown-hued people remain scarce. Instead, black women have been hit over the head with sexist and nonsensical advice on why we’re still single and studies that suggest most of us will never get married. It’s only been in the last year or two that the narrative has begun to shift. Black women are reclaiming their romantic lives and telling their own stories.In her screenwriting debut, Community’s Yvette Nicole Brown’s has crafted a story about demanding the love you deserve and letting yourself fall, despite any fears that you might have. Always a Bridesmaid, directed by The Man in 3B’s Trey Haley, follows Corina James (Batwoman’s Javicia Leslie), a career-focused copy editor, toiling away at her father, Carlton Blakeston Sr’s (Richard Lawson) publishing company while keeping her ambitions as a novelist under wraps.Entering her 30s, Corina spends her weekends attending weddings, bridal showers, bachelorette parties, and hanging out with her tight-knit group of girlfriends. As her friends embark on new stages in their lives, Corina’s false sense of “contentedness” begins to make her feel restless. Things take a turn when she runs into an old (and very fine) friend from Hampton University – Mark Randall (Black Lightning’s Jordan Calloway), who awakens something in Corina that she thought she could never have.As things become increasingly tense with her father at work and after her best friends, Tamara (Michelle Mitchenor) and Brad (Tosin Morohunfola) announce they are expecting their first child, Corina is forced to face herself. She must decide if she’s finally ready to put herself first when it comes to her professional and romantic life.Haley sets Brown’s story against a stunning Chicago backdrop, not the crime-riddled city plastered across our TV screens during the news. Instead, Corina’s Chi-town is full of plush coffee houses, romantic spots for dates, offices overlooking the skyline, yoga lessons, spa sessions and a gorgeous brick-lined loft, all full of bold colors and textures.Black women have been told that they can’t have it all, but that simply isn’t the case. After witnessing the infidelity in her parents’ marriage, her own fractured romances, and reeling from her mother’s death, Corina is terrified of opening her heart again. Still, though she makes several missteps when it comes to stepping out of her comfort zone, she’s willing to work on herself. Corina not only heeds her friends’ dating advice (albeit reluctantly), she has no qualms about attending her weekly therapy sessions with Pastor Althea Brody (played by Brown herself). In these sequences, Brown highlights that black women have been able to come as far as we have in this country, as the most educated and entrepreneurial group because we aren’t afraid to look inward.As Corina slowly opens her heart to Mark, her eyes open up to possibilities that she could have never expected. Unfortunately, their romance is not without its issues. After all, it’s hard to accept things that you don’t think you can have. As a result, Corina makes some extremely frustrating choices that will surely make the audience grit their teeth.Always a Bridesmaid is a part of a new broader landscape of black romance films like The Photograph, Queen \u0026amp Slim and even If Beale Street Could Talk that tell us that it’s OK if marriage or a relationship is built on desire. They also say that there’s nothing wrong with building a life on your own. A rich and full existence can be attainable either way. These films center honesty and respect. They only ask of characters to forgive mistakes instead of seeing them as egregious moral failings.Always a Bridesmaid isn’t a perfect film – it opens like a very stereotypical romcom with some of Corina’s other romantic interests acting buffoonish and over-the-top. They often go a bit too far to be taken seriously. Also, Corina’s lack of growth at times, makes her a remarkably maddening character. But despite some of its cheesier moments – as with most romantic comedies, Always a Bridesmaid is a warm and delightful reminder, to black women in particular, that you can be far from perfect and still get the fairytale that you deserve. As Pastor Brody says in the film: “Love is for everybody.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0eaec9d98fa4fd80b1cd50d29792bcf990911ff0/229_0_2899_1740/master/2899.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=0b68e93bed68fd857f33a062138f8408","title":"final tweet from chadwick boseman account most liked ever on twitter","story":"Statement confirming the Black Panther star’s death from cancer has more than 7m ‘likes’, as tributes continue to pour in for actorThe final tweet from the account of Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman has become the most-liked post in Twitter history.The social media company’s official feed announced the news.

It is the biggest box office take for a film in the UK in seven months, since Sam Mendes’s 1917 in January.Tenet has been viewed as a litmus test of whether fans are ready to return to movie theatres en masse, as the UK cinema industry aims to salvage something from a year destined to be the worst at the box office in three decades. An enthusiastic, mask-wearing Tom Cruise was among the fans to catch a screening of Tenet in London.“We are off to a fantastic start internationally and couldn’t be more pleased,” said Toby Emmerich, the chairman of Warner Bros. “Given the unprecedented circumstances of this global release, we know we are running a marathon, not a sprint, and look forward to long playability for this film globally for many weeks to come.”After pushing back the global release of Tenet multiple times because the pandemic was continuing to run rampant in the US – the world’s biggest movie market by some distance – Warner Bros took the unprecedented step of launching internationally first.\u0026nbspGiven the reception the film has received, taking $53m internationally and beating analysts’ expectations, hopes are high that it will replicate that performance when it launches in major markets including the US and China at the weekend.“If this weekend’s stellar box office performance by Tenet offers any indication, the power of one film to jumpstart the industry has been made manifest,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst at Comscore.With a schedule devoid of fresh Hollywood blockbusters, cinema owners have had to fall back on low-grossing classics and old hits, with the original Jurassic Park making a return to the top 10 during lockdown.The box office surge, which follows paltry weekly takes of less than £1m across all films shown in the UK and Ireland since cinemas reopened in July, bodes well for upcoming releases including James Bond: No Time To Die."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0f9052808b3600503e33763a14d057f0b5bcb58/356_99_1634_980/master/1634.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f40f309c1ac69f6530ecb16971dcef8b","title":"chadwick boseman a life in pictures","story":"The US actor best known for his role as T’Challa in Black Panther, has died at the age of 43.

Maybe this year. There was a sense that Lyon’s vice-like grip on the Champions League trophy was loosening. Maybe. Possibly that stranglehold had relaxed, that now the French behemoths had only one firm hand and four fingers on silverware they have colonised for the past four seasons. There are signs, not of Lyon slackening, but of the competition closing the gap.Shorn of the talents of the Norwegian sensation Ada Hegerberg, dominant centre-half Mbock Bathy and midfield lynchpin Amandine Henry due to injury for this mini-tournament in northern Spain, there was an optimism that 2020 might see someone other than the familiar, towering figure of Wendie Renard hoisting the trophy aloft.Wolfsburg, Europe’s “second team” for some years, hardly represented a shock challenger to Lyon’s hegemony – they won the trophy in 2013 and 2014, after all.However, the German side have been relegated to bridesmaid status emphatically by Lyon in recent years – Lyon had eliminated Wolfsburg from the Champions League in each of the last four seasons prior to Sunday.Lyon didn’t sparkle in victories over Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain in the quarter- and semi-finals. Instead it was muscle memory that saw them through, the rarefied air of “been there, done that and now we own the T-shirt stall”.Wolfsburg are a women’s footballing powerhouse and even they cannot match the pedigree of their opponents. The Wolves had looked in excellent condition in the build-up to this final, which, added to Lyon’s injury problems, meant that there was a sense that now was the time to interrupt their hegemony.It was Cascarino who smuggled her way to the byline again on the right in the 25th minute and pulled the ball back to Eugénie Le Sommer in the area. Her initial effort was saved by the feet of Friederike Abt in the Wolfsburg goal but Le Sommer was the quickest to react and turned the rebound home. Two minutes before half-time Lyon scored the second goal that their dominance deserved.Cascarino again tossed a cross into the Wolfsburg area which a panicky German defence failed to deal with and the Japanese midfielder Saki Kumagai drilled the ball into the bottom corner from the edge of the area.For all the talk of the gap potentially closing at the top, Lyon were making short work of their closest challengers.Playing through Wolfsburg’s famed high press, Lyon’s confident start to the second half was punctured on 58 minutes. Wolfsburg clawed their way back when a third Lyon goal looked more likely.Fridolino Rolfö’s cross was only half-cleared by the Lyon defence, Ewa Pajor hooked the ball back into the six-yard box and Alexandra Popp popped up to head the ball in. Now Lyon made their peerless big-game experience count in a different way, carefully repelling Wolfsburg as they summoned a second wind.Lyon withstood Wolfsburg’s advances and made the game safe on 88 minutes when Abt could only punch a corner to the feet of Le Sommer. She drove the ball back towards goal and Sara Björk Gunnarsdóttir, a Wolfsburg player until eight weeks ago, hooked the ball into the net. The Icelandic international earns the unique distinction of being eligible for both a winner’s and a runner-up medal having played three games for each finalist in this season’s competition.For all the talk of the gap to Lyon closing, the now seven-times European champions took care of business in much the manner they always do. No Hegerberg, no Henry, no Mbock, no Parris for the final, no problem. And it’s back to the drawing board for Europe’s chasing pack."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9eb809772913361176f254957836fd029a932b8f/0_318_4571_2744/master/4571.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26ff5b94a0ee89ac84cad7dfd342847e","title":"premier league 2020 21 preview no 1 arsenal","story":"FA Cup glory came ahead of schedule for Mikel Arteta but he may need to be patient to complete his planned transformation  writers’ predicted position: 6th (NB: this is not necessarily Nick Ames’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 40-1Make it two that got away. The manner in which Serge Gnabry escaped Arsenal’s clutches is well known. Gnabry had verbally agreed a new contract before travelling to the 2016 Olympics with Germany, but instead signed for Werder Bremen and the rest is painful modern history. But it is less well documented that Kingsley Coman could have been an Arsenal player, too. Coman was leaving Paris Saint-Germain when he and his agent visited Arsenal’s training ground in 2014, with the club willing to pay a compensation fee in the low hundred-thousands and a seven-figure salary. But the transfer did not get over the line instead Coman and Gnabry were fundamental to the outcome of this year’s Champions League and one figure close to both missed deals is only half-joking when he says he has to switch channels within five minutes when Bayern Munich pop up on his television.The point of the story? It is that, for all the recriminations of the last half-decade, a couple of relatively minor deviations might have seen Arsenal’s recent past look decidedly different. They need these things to start going their way and that is why the vision and clarity shown during Arteta’s first eight months are tantalising. Arteta’s intention to become a top coach was well trailed but, as many others have found, walking the talk can be rather more difficult. So if he is for real, as seems increasingly certain, the possibilities begin to appear limitless.Arteta could thank Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for Arsenal’s FA Cup win, given the captain’s doubles against Manchester City and Chelsea, but could also reflect on tactics that had deservedly outdone superior sides. The troubled squad he inherited has been treated with varying levels of light and shade. Matteo Guendouzi and Mesut Özil were left in no doubt about what happens to anyone Arteta feels has not nailed their colours to the cause, but he has seemingly persuaded a previously sceptical Aubameyang to see out his top-level playing career at the club. Granit Xhaka was also convinced to reverse from the exit door while Willian, who should be an excellent addition even if a three-year contract makes the eyes water, has admitted to being enamoured of Arteta’s plans.It appears Arteta has an uncanny ability to bring others with him. While Aubameyang’s chip at Wembley ensured Arteta’s Arsenal won a major trophy ahead of schedule, the coming season will show whether the vessel is a hydrofoil or a paddle steamer. Arteta has no interest in seeing Arsenal become accustomed to playing like underdogs, as they did so successfully in those big wins – Liverpool were another scalp – at the end of 2019-20. He wants to see them dominate the ball and be aggressive with it to pass and probe as forcefully as, in the weeks after the Covid-19 shutdown, his forwards pressed defenders when out of possession.That will take time and Arteta is likely to find one transfer window is not enough. He has, in theory at least, the hands-on role in recruitment that he wanted, with Raul Sanllehi taken out of the picture. Willian’s versatility and fluid movements will help an attack that, with Özil requiring a truly Lazarus-like comeback to regain favour, otherwise sorely lacks guile. Gabriel Magalhães looks sure to arrive from Lille and, with William Saliba now available, Arsenal have the kind of young, dominant, athletic centre-back options an often chaotic backline has sorely lacked. But players will have to depart if a troubled midfield is to be supplemented with top-level talent. It is hard to see their longstanding pursuit of Atlético Madrid’s Thomas Partey bearing fruit, for example, unless at least one of Guendouzi and Lucas Torreira departs. The summer has been expensive and Arsenal, who recently made 55 redundancies in non-football areas, have to start bringing money back in.So Arteta may find more compromises have to be made: a few more grinding wins over the Champions League qualifiers or afternoons where, if the ball will not do the work, the most important thing is to keep the back door bolted. He has shown he can get results now he must keep them coming while turning Arsenal into a living iteration of his blueprint. Bayern’s blistering wingers may have long gone, but Arteta is capable of banishing those regrets for good.They have retained the same colours but Arsenal are, in other ways, chameleons. First they swapped south-east London, where they were born, for Highbury in 1913. Then they became entertainers, trailblazers and innovators under the inspirational Herbert Chapman. Fast-forward half a century and they had become the “boring”, attritional but storied grinders of the 1980s and early 1990s. Now they are expected to live up to the near-impossible standards set by Arsène Wenger in the first decade of his reign, the “Arsenal way” cast as a sleek and stylish brand of attacking football that has materialised only in spurts since their move to the shiny Emirates in 2006.On the touchline Arteta usually plumps for brooding all-black getup, effortlessly straddling the gap between “slung together” and “painstakingly thought-through”. He covers plenty of ground and rattles through his body of foreign languages: English, Spanish, French and Portuguese feature in his exhortations.On Zoom Punctual, personable and sometimes perfunctory. Arteta tends to give off the air of a man fulfilling a commitment but understands the power of the medium too. His views on Guendouzi, Özil and even the club’s ambition were aired eloquently and – sometimes – bluntly.Anyone citing the importance of Aubameyang would be excused for feeling like a stuck record but, assuming his deal goes through as expected, he will be fundamental to anything Arsenal and Arteta achieve. If you are moulding a new, young defence and a more balanced midfield it helps to have the ision’s best striker.Stan Kroenke and his firm, Kroenke Sports and Entertainment, have been at the helm since 2011. Recent seasons have seen a rise in “Get out of our club” chants, with a decidedly un-touchy-feely approach to ownership doing the Kroenkes few favours. The hope is this season begins to reverse the decline they have overseen.Arteta has spoken glowingly about Reiss Nelson, saying he has “the potential to do whatever he wants”. It is time for the 20-year-old to deliver: he has bundles of talent and showed it in patches last season, scoring against Liverpool and shining in the cup against Leeds and Portsmouth. But can he impose himself consistently?The arrivals of Willian and – hopefully – Gabriel have been well trailed. A less high-profile newcomer, Andreas Georgson, formerly Brentford’s head of set pieces and inidual development, has been enlisted to keep Arsenal sharp and smart from free-kicks and corners.It is a story as old as the hills – or at least dating to the club’s foundation in 1886, when Nottingham Forest donated a set of dark red shirts and white shorts after a plea from two former players who had wound up with the Gunners. Herbert Chapman thought of the sleeves, and the lighter shade of red, years later.The jokes about an empty Emirates differing little from the full-fat experience were worn out quickly. There have not been many innovations to separate Arsenal’s home from the rest, save for the usual tailored seat coverings and pre-match music playlists.A major tournament in 2020 would probably have come too soon for Bukayo Saka. Next summer, though, is another scenario entirely and if he continues to grow in stature it is hard to see him not getting an England call."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca511701e641bb4f28038733d77de9c899a581dc/345_0_1571_943/master/1571.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6b1308aa56025dc81bc078f7e132d280","title":"recognise dfid expertise and influence in fco merger raab urged","story":"Department for International Development gave ‘huge heft to global Britain’, says ex-secretary of state ahead of Wednesday mergerForeign secretary Dominic Raab must recognise the “extraordinary influence and expertise” of staff at the Department for International Development (DfID) to maintain Britain’s position in the world, according to former development secretary Andrew Mitchell.Mitchell, who was secretary of state from 2010 to 2012, said the DfID, which merges with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on 2 September to become the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), had contributed “huge heft to global Britain” in terms of soft power.As the new Whitehall department launched, MPs, peers and aid experts urged Raab and the FCDO leadership team to ensure independent scrutiny of the aid budget, clear lines of accountability and the alleviation of poverty at the heart of its spending.Mitchell, who initially described the merger as a “self-inflicted act of vandalism” when it was announced by Boris Johnson in June, said: “It’s a genuine takeover. In the city, you know there’s no such thing as a merger and that is the case here. But it is a fait accompli. Criticism is shouting at the moon. It’s clear it’s going to happen so we should be constructive about the future.”He urged the FCDO leadership to reassure DfID staff who are “passionate about development but also are extremely able civil servants”.Mitchell said: “The important thing first of all is to ensure that there is an understanding and respect for Britain’s international leadership and it’s not seen as a conquest by the Foreign Office. That means recognising within DfID there is extraordinary world-leading expertise that should be nurtured and respected, and the tentacles of that stretch out into British universities and thinktanks and British NGOs, which like everybody else are going through a very tough time at the moment.“The influence which DfID exerted, through literally every multilateral and international development organisation in the world, is extraordinarily extensive and an important part of British soft power, which contributes huge heft to global Britain. It’s obviously important that all of this is clearly understood by the most senior decision makers in the Foreign Office.”Plans had long been mooted to combine the two departments, but the manner and timing of the announcement shocked DfID staff and the wider aid industry. Three former prime ministers criticised the decision.Over the weekend Raab announced a review of the aid watchdog, the independent commission for aid impact (ICAI), in order to increase “transparency and accountability” of the aid budget,and to ensure a focus on Global Britain. The aid budget will be integrated “with our diplomatic clout” to maximise the impact of our foreign policy”, Raab said, and the review will ensure ICAI will look at the impact of the spend in line with aims of the FCDO. Aid groups welcomed the retention of ICAI but said they hoped it would be matched by effective parliamentary scrutiny by a cross parliamentary committee.Kerr agreed that DfID staff needed reassurance, saying it must have been very worrying for them to have the prime minister compare the aid spend to a “giant cashpoint” in the sky. “There are things the FCDO could do to improve morale, for instance give the top economic job to someone at DfID. DfID economists are world class,” said Kerr. Appointing some of the big overseas jobs from DfID officials, would also be good for morale, he said.He said he was concerned the merger will distract from Britain hosting Cop26 in Glasgow and the G7 next year, but added that there were advantages to the FCDO. “Aid programmes may be more efficient in country where you have a high commission or ambassador who is well-briefed on aid,” he said.Sarah Champion, who heads the cross-party independent development committee, said: “The government needs to be vigilant to make sure there is no whiff of tied aid or it will seriously undermine the credibility of our foreign policy. To maintain our international reputation, we need to be visibly acting with integrity when it comes to our aid programme.”Champion also urged parliamentary scrutiny of the overseas aid spend.Sara Pantuliano, the chief executive at the Overseas Development Institute, said the FCDO has come at a good moment, as the Black Lives Matter movement gains prominence and debate continues over the decolonisation of aid.Last week, the  reported that many black Asian and minority ethnic men working at DfID claim to have experienced prejudice at work.“Development was so narrowly focused and, often, there is a patronising tone,” she said. “Bringing together development expertise with foreign officer expertise could become a holistic exercise, with the right approach and the right political energy.”Some DfID staff believe their work on poverty reduction could be undermined by diplomatic staff determined to put UK commercial interests first. Many were dismayed at the makeup of the FCDO leadership team, announced last week. Five appointees, including political director Tim Barrow, were from the FCO, only two were DfID officials.One DfID staffer told the  how they and others were in tears at a meeting last week as Nick Dyer, DfID’s acting permanent secretary, told them he would not be joining the FCDO.“His value, expertise and evidence-based approach will be missed,” the staffer said. “The leadership team names were a shock. The majority were FCO. We’ve been told that development is at the heart of the FCDO, but it’s difficult to feel like that at the moment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c23b926e6ddbe208c94cef2cbf3b406f8308fe9/0_249_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=976328ec1ddf36e26202f6f5e09345b8","title":"imagine using liquid water why people water their house plants with ice cubes","story":"Often touted as an easy solution to overwatering, the practice of placing ice cubes in orchids has become a ‘comedy horticultural moment’One piece of houseplant folklore resurfaces from time to time: that we should water our plants with ice cubes.For years everything from Reader’s Digest to Reddit offered up ice cubes as the trick to keeping potted friends alive. Recently the theory has returned thanks to a pair of meme pages.The Instagram accounts planty hoes and oops_i_wet_my_plants have been facilitating, as one commenter put it, a “comedy horticultural moment” with posts debating the efficacy of watering with ice cubes. In the comments, some followers swear they have a grandmother or old family friend who has successfully been raising orchids using ice cubes for decades.She thinks the current millennial and generation Z embrace of house plants has something to do with its comeback: “People are jumping on the trend now because everybody’s collecting indoor plants and a lot of people have either killed them, or want an easy solution to watering.”It’s not hard to kill a plant – death by overwatering is particularly common as excess water can pool down the bottom of pots and lead to root rot. Proponents of the cube theory think that ice gives the plant time to slowly absorb water as it melts. It’s not an unsubstantiated idea: in 2017, researchers at Ohio State University studying the use of ice cubes to water orchids found the practice had “no detrimental effects”.But experts today say it’s not a good approach. “I wouldn’t recommend it,” Lauren Camilleri from Leaf Supply, an online plant delivery business, tells  Australia.For one thing, the ice cubes could still waterlog your plant if they melt faster than they can be absorbed, she says. But most importantly, the extreme temperature of ice could send your plant into shock – killing it.“When we bring plants inside, what we’re trying to do is mimic their natural environment as much as possible in terms of light and the way we water them,” she says. “A lot of the plants that do well indoors are tropical plants – they come from the rainforest. So the water they’re getting in nature definitely isn’t going to be overly cold or overly hot.”Many of the Instagram memes centre around a specific plant: orchids. Are the rules different for them, or are people just looking for an easy solution to caring for a plant that’s notoriously difficult to keep alive?“Definitely the latter,” says Huynh. “People treat orchids as quite delicate things. But really, all you need to do when you water orchids is put them over the sink, pour water over them until it runs out of the bottom and then let the plant drain completely before putting it back.”No matter what plant you’re raising, there’s no exact formula for how much and how often it will need to be watered. Your best bet, Huynh says, is to feel the soil and only water once the top few centimetres is completely dry. It’s a little more complicated than just chucking a few ice cubes in the pot, but it works."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c7068aa2c5e10da2ce25c04df6b4c2f66bea1b4/0_0_2126_1417/master/2126.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6c971a8edbabb1103978bf19be95ad1 660w","title":"living in the uk are you planning to move out of a city or urban area","story":"We would like to hear from people who are moving to smaller towns or more rural areas and what their reasons areAre you planning on moving out of a city?Some have noticed an increase in people wanting to move out of cities amid an increase in home working and a desire for more outside space.Whether you are buying or renting, if you are moving out of a city centre to a more suburban or rural area, we would like to hear from you.

We’re still very much aiming for June,” she wrote.“We’ve moved our ticket resale back from October to April, because so few people have asked for a refund (next year’s festival remains sold out), meaning we don’t have enough tickets to resell.“Plus, we’ve extended the free cancellation deadline until the end of January.”Paul McCartney, Taylor Swift and Kendrick Lamar were set to headline the Pyramid Stage this year to celebrate the festival’s landmark anniversary.Michael Eavis previously told ITV News West Country they were “moving heaven and earth” to make sure the festival happened in 2021.“But that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s going to happen. That’s just wishful thinking,” he said. “The only certainty I think is the year after, 2022, to be perfectly candid, so we might have to wait for two years maybe.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18af78ea383f86d53c8a7684f4ec08b550543e25/55_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97e71379ac6e61cf1098f73f2f3845e0","title":"mtv vmas 2020 lady gaga dominates during unusual pandemic broadcast","story":"Singer reigns supreme in awards show filled with calls for social justice and recognition of Covid tragedyLady Gaga dominated an unusual year for the MTV Video Music awards, winning five awards in a strange and disconcerting evening.The singer, who led the evening with nine nominations and wore a variety of masks through the night, accepted awards for artist of the year, song of the year, best cinematography and best collaboration for Rain on Me and the inaugural Tricon award, which recognizes an artist who is highly accomplished across three or more disciplines.“Just because we’re separated right now, and culture may feels less alive in some ways, I know a Renaissance is coming,” she said during her final acceptance speech. “Stay safe, speak your mind, and I might sound like a broken record, but wear a mask — it’s a sign of respect.”The VMAs was the first major awards broadcast to air since the coronavirus pandemic shuttered production in America. The hybrid program mixed video acceptances, audience-less performances, and an unearthly, unidentifiable studio base in New York City and leaned heavily on video effects and star enthusiasm.An ebullient Keke Palmer hosted from an outdoor set somewhere near the Empire State Building (“They’ve got me on top of every building,” she joked) before an “audience” whose reality was difficult to discern (“crowd noise” tracks were almost certainly used). The multi-hyphenate host kicked off the ceremony with a pre-recorded video honoring Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman, who died at age 43 on Friday after a previously undisclosed, four-year fight with colon cancer. Boseman was “a true hero”, said Palmer, “not just on screen, but in every thing he did.”Whereas last year’s VMAs were criticised for host Sebastian Mansicalco’s tone-deaf jokes about “safe spaces”, Palmer minced no words in addressing the present of Black Lives Matter protests the nationwide response to the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor have demonstrated that young people will “step up, take to the streets, and make sure they’re heard.” Palmer, whose video pleading with police officers to listen during protests in Los Angeles went viral, also directly addressed the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin. “We must continue the fight to end systemic racism,” she said. “It’s our time to be the change we want to see.”Other winners included The Weeknd for best video for Blinding Lights, Taylor Swift for best direction for The Man, Maluma’s Qué Pena for best Latin, Megan Thee Stallion’s Savage for best hip-hop, On by BTS for best pop, and Doja Cat for best new artist.Calls for unity and racial justice echoed throughout the evening – rapper DaBaby performed on a police car with the sign Stop Killing Us, R\u0026ampB star HER won best video for good for her song I Can’t Breathe – in a show which continued last year’s celebration of Latin music as a dominant cultural force. The night featured two Spanish performances from Colombian star Maluma and the Latin group CNCO, both at a drive-in theater in Brooklyn, as well as a retro-themed rendition of Dynamite by K-pop superstars BTS, whose music video set the record last week for most YouTube views within 24 hours.But the main throughline was the ongoing pandemic and the show directly spoke to the tragedy and resiliences of the past six months – Palmer introduced a segment in which frontline healthcare workers danced and sang, cameras cut frequently backstage to reveal masked stars walking along taped distancing guidelines. Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande and their backup dancers wore masks for the performance of Rain on Me. MTV introduced two distinctly 2020 categories – best music video from home (Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande for Stuck with U) and best quarantine performance (Latin supergroup CNCO for De Cero  Honey Boo) – as a nod to strange times.Perhaps nothing captured the tone of the ceremony quite like the last five minutes, when The Weeknd accepted the night’s capstone award for best video with a brief, subdued speech – “like I said, hard to celebrate, so I’m just going to say: justice for Jacob Blake and justice for Breonna Taylor” — that cut quickly into the finale performance by the Black Eyed Peas. The band closed out the night with 2010’s I’ve Got A Feeling – an ode to better times.“I know it’s tough right now, but we’ve gotta keep the love alive,” said the group’s frontman Will.i.am, adding as the night’s final words: “Wakanda forever. Black lives matter.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7d0a7b0a7c08a7faf12793e39bb4e250f063a6b/893_542_2570_1541/master/2570.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9937da815751d8cd348ddc65891eed01","title":"covid vaccine rush could make pandemic worse say scientists","story":"Experts say strong evidence of efficacy needed to avoid approval of inferior vaccinesThe rush to immunise populations against Covid-19 could lead to the rollout of a vaccine that is not very effective and risk worsening the pandemic, leading scientists have said.Ministers announced on Friday that the UK would take emergency powers to push any vaccine through the regulatory processes with unprecedented speed before the end of the year. Donald Trump wants to be able to announce the US has a vaccine before tthe presidential election on 3 November.A vaccine is vital to stopping the pandemic, but Prof Sir Richard Peto of Oxford University and an adviser to the World Health Organization, said the first vaccine would be bought and used all over the world even if it had low efficacy.Even if it protected only a minority of the population, it would be regarded as the standard by which later vaccines would be measured. That could even lead to inferior vaccines being approved, because they would not have to show that they were any better.“I think there’s a big rush, a somewhat nationalistic rush and also somewhat capitalistic rush as well, to be absolutely first to register a vaccine, and it will actually make it more difficult to evaluate other vaccines,” Peto said.“We do need a vaccine that works and we need it soon,” but “we really do need quite strong evidence of efficacy”.There is huge political and commercial momentum in the UK behind the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine, which is ahead of most other contenders in the world. Trials are taking place in a number of countries, including those with high levels of infection, such as South Africa and Brazil, where how well it works will become clear more quickly .The Department of Health said on Friday that it planned to take emergency measures to ensure the UK could licence a vaccine this year if it had sufficient evidence of safety and efficacy. Until 31 December, the UK would otherwise have to wait for the European Medicines Agency to approve a vaccine. Next year, post-Brexit, the UK will license its own vaccines and drugs.In its consultation document on changing the law, the government says the UK’s joint committee on vaccines and immunisation (JCVI) will be responsible for recommending that a vaccine that should go forward for licensing. That committee is chaired by Prof Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, who has said they may have enough data to give to regulators before the end of the year.Peto is a member of the WHO’s Solidarity Vaccines Trial Expert Group, which is made up of leading scientists around the world who are advising on the establishment of the WHO’s trial to compare different vaccine candidates.The group said in the Lancet medical journal last week that a poor vaccine would be worse than no vaccine, not least because people who had it would assume they were no longer at risk and stop social distancing.“Deployment of a weakly effective vaccine could actually worsen the Covid-19 pandemic if authorities wrongly assume it causes a substantial reduction in risk, or if vaccinated iniduals wrongly believe they are immune, hence reducing implementation of, or compliance with, other Covid-19 control measures,” they said.The Lancet piece says trials such as Solidarity, which compare various vaccines, are a better way to proceed.“In comparison with inidual trials for each of the many different vaccines, a global multi-vaccine trial with a shared control group could provide more rapid and reliable results,” they write.“High enrolment rates facilitated by flexible trial design and hundreds of study sites in high-incidence locations could yield results on short-term efficacy for each vaccine within just a few months of including that vaccine.”Good results on safety and effectiveness do not guarantee there will be no long-term problems, they add. The vaccine’s protection may wane, for instance.“The trial costs will be a fraction of the societal costs of Covid-19, and this global collaboration could rebut detrimental vaccine nihilism and vaccine nationalism,” they write."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d0aab4894141062e23a3dcaee529ace234d2d29/0_190_4104_2462/master/4104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=576fef8dcff8e6a73701b8dbe587fe6d","title":"four day working week could create 500k new jobs in uk study says","story":"Exclusive: thinktank says measure to mitigate unemployment during Covid-19 recession has precedents in both Europe and USA four-day week in the public sector would create up to half a million new jobs and help limit the rise in unemployment expected over the coming months, according to research by the progressive thinktank Autonomy.Amid concerns that the jobless total is set to rise sharply as the Treasury’s furlough scheme is wound down, the thinktank said the time was right for Rishi Sunak to pioneer a shorter working week.The Autonomy study represents the first attempt to quantify the jobs impact of a four-day week, with the thinktank saying it would be possible for public sector workers to go on to a 32-hour week with no loss of pay.It added that the scheme would cost between £5.4bn and £9bn a year and have the biggest impact in the “red wall” seats in the Midlands and the north of England captured by the Conservatives in the 2019 general election.More than 5 million people work in the public sector – about one in six of those in employment – but the report noted that in places such as Doncaster, Bradford and Barnsley the proportion rose to about one in five. London, which has a higher percentage of private sector employment would benefit less, the thinktank said.A government spokesperson said: “It is not for the government to mandate working patterns for businesses or their employees. The important thing is that they have the flexibility to agree a working pattern that suits them.“This also applies to the civil service and our commitment to flexible working is one of the reasons we consistently rank as one of the best employers in the UK.”Will Stronge, Autonomy’s research director, said: “The time has come for a four-day working week and the public sector should act as the pioneer for it, both as employer and as procurer of services.“To help tackle the unemployment crisis we are facing this winter, a four-day week is the best option for sharing work more equally across the economy and creating much needed new jobs.“The four-day week makes so much sense as it would boost productivity, create new jobs and make us all much happier and healthier.”The report said the public sector should test out the idea as it would reduce burnout, work-related poor mental health and drastically improve work-life balance. More than two-thirds of UK workers were stressed or overworked, the thinktank said.The report said the idea of a shorter working week had been tried in the past during periods of high unemployment.“The oft-cited example of President Roosevelt’s New Deal measures which reduced the working week to 40 hours maximum, is a case in point. Such a scheme is also not unprecedented in the UK: the first Thatcher government inherited and maintained a similar initiative during the 1979-1982 recession.“Nor is it merely an artefact from history: in Germany the tried and tested Kurzarbeit scheme was used during the 2008 financial crash to mitigate mass unemployment by subsidising a reduction and reallocation of labour, and has again been used during the Covid crisis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/459f7de2f24abe78e220d8d8c305ba9dbfa11e94/117_2_3129_1878/master/3129.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12152d2fef1d8252e399d38d5c169819","title":"lewis hamilton bemoans the fact mercedes are in a one horse race","story":"Lewis Hamilton has admitted that were he only a fan of Formula One he would probably tune in just for highlights of races given the dominance he and Mercedes are demonstrating this season.After a controlled victory at the Belgian GP, Hamilton’s fifth of the season and Mercedes’ sixth from seven races, the world champion believed the spectacle was lacking compared to when he watched Michael Schumacher’s domination as a teenager. However, he insisted it is up to the rule makers to improve the competition.Hamilton led every lap of the race from pole and his lead was not threatened. He finished eight seconds clear of his teammate Valtteri Bottas, with Max Verstappen a further seven behind in third. The race at the front was processional to such an extent that Verstappen repeatedly bemoaned how boring taking part in it was.“When I was a teenage kid I would have woken up, had my bacon sarnie, watched the start and gone to sleep then woken up to watch the end,” Hamilton said. “If I was watching today I would do the same most likely and watch the highlights because they are much shorter.“Having grown up watching the Schumacher era, of course I know what it is like. I feel the same as Max, it was not the most exciting. I enjoy it myself in the car because if you don’t enjoy the moment what’s the point in doing it? I am still able to enjoy the battle but perhaps it is not as much fun for people to watch. When you are in it it is different, but of course I would love a wheel-to-wheel race.”Schumacher won five consecutive championships for Ferrari between 2000 and 2004. Hamilton has scored five in seven years with Mercedes and is on course for another. He insisted that the major regulation change with redesigned cars for 2022 would represent a great opportunity for the sport.“What fans and people need to understand is this is not our fault, we are drivers, we have come through all the ranks, we have earned the positions we have,” he said. “We give everything to go out there and perform at our best. Ultimately the decision-makers who design cars, set rules, are the ones you could apply pressure to ultimately do a better job.

Clearly, they are not prepared to give this breakaway much rope, which tells you all you need to know about their intentions for the finish in Sisteron.Sam Bennett (Deceuninck–Quick-Step) was the most heavily-backed favourite on the betting markets this morning. Who do you think will win? Peter Sagan (Bora-Hansgrohe) and Caleb Ewan (Lotto Soudal) are other obvious candidates. Ewan in particular will be one to watch - he can be very effective on uphill sprint finishes.Do send me an email or a tweet with your thoughts on that, or anything else Tour de France-related ...Seb Piquet, the world-famous voice of Tour Radio, seems to think rain might not be too far away:And here is a computer-generated fly-through of today’s route:Here’s the GC top 10 as they stand after Stage 2:Peter Sagan (Bora-Hansgrohe) was showing off again before today’s stage. Which is always good to watch:There is a three-man breakaway who currently have an advantage of about 2’15” on the peloton. Benoît Cosnefroy (Ag2r-La Mondiale) in the polka-dots, Jérôme Cousin (Total Direct Énergie) and Anthony Perez (Cofidis Solutions Crédits) are the men in it. Oliver Naesen (Ag2r-La Mondiale) was there originally but has now dropped back to the bunch, leaving a 100 per cent French trio at the tête de la course. The 2020 Tour de France seems to have begun on fast-forward. Long before the Covid-19 pandemic ensured this race would take place in extraordinary circumstances, the organisers had chosen to insert a mountain stage on just the second day, which is fairly extraordinary in itself.Following a chaotic, crash-filled, rainswept first stage around Nice, won by Alexander Kristoff (UAE Team Emirates), Julian Alaphilippe of Deceuninck–Quick-Step triumphed on Sunday’s remarkably early foray into the mountains. So, a Frenchman wears the yellow jersey as the world’s greatest race travels inland on today’s 198km trip from Nice to Sisteron, and all seems bien with the world, at least if you are French cycling fan casting an eye over the general classification. The polka-dot jersey is also on the shoulders of a Frenchman, Benoît Cosnefroy of AG2R La Mondiale, who has already snuck into today’s early breakaway.The first half of today’s stage is going to be tough even if it already looks to have settled into a familiar pattern: the category-three Cols du Pilon and de le Faye come inside the first 65km, which is almost all uphill. There are four categorised climbs in all, with the Col de Lègues (category three) cresting at 117.5km and the Col de l’Orme (category four) at 152.5km. There is an intermediate sprint after 160.5km, coming in a final 70km which is almost all downhill. It looks set to a be textbook breakaway-followed-by-bunch-sprint kind of affair, with the sprinters’ teams almost guaranteed to bring it all back together for a bunch kick on an uphill finish in Sisteron.But in this Tour de France with a difference, with the risk of cancellation hanging over the event, will some teams and riders regard this as something other than a day simply to be negotiated ahead of bigger tests to come? Can Alaphilippe stay in yellow? We will find out in a few hours’ time, and are sure to see some beautiful TV helicopter shots of from south of France along the way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb69b471efb9352e9ae52d9003c21b1a816416a8/0_0_5351_3212/master/5351.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57ca8c7bdd4a00adbe9e862994ca400d","title":"ruth mackenzie the british change maker sacked by pariss artistic elite","story":"Despite fulfilling her brief to bring ersity to the Châtelet Theatre, the veteran director was brusquely dismissed. So what went wrong?When the British arts supremo Ruth Mackenzie was named artistic director of Paris’s Châtelet theatre she thought everyone knew what they were getting.Her pitch for the job, approved by the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, after a gruelling four interview panels, was to reinvent the historic Paris venue – known as “Broadway sur Seine” after the previous director’s penchant for American musicals – as a more erse and inclusive people’s theatre.The first woman and first foreigner in the role, she was hired as a double act with Thomas Lauriot dit Prévost to revolutionise the institution and welcome new actors and audiences.The first production when the Châtelet reopened after a two-year £28.6m renovation last September offered an eclectic cast including musicians from Ukraine and giant puppets from Mozambique. There followed a rap interpretation of Albert Camus’ Les Justes by Abd Al Malik, the first black artist to direct a play at the theatre, featuring youngsters from the Paris banlieue.Last week, however, the revolution ate its own. Mackenzie was sitting in her office when she learned to her astonishment that she had been sacked for “bullying”. She was even more shocked, when Lauriot dit Prévost, with whom she shared an office, insisted she leave immediately.“I was given just enough time to put my belongings in a few bags,” Mackenzie says in her first interview since being dismissed. “I was left thinking: why me and why so cruel and brutal? I can only assume it’s because I’m a woman and foreign, because otherwise why was I targeted when I was working as a team?”There was worse to come. Later that day, Mackenzie says she was told she would be given a “civilised and generous” package to leave quietly and a joint statement would be released to the press. Instead, the following morning the theatre’s press office sent journalists a one-line email saying Mackenzie was gone.Summary sackings are almost unheard of in France. Sitting in a brasserie in the north of Paris, Mackenzie, dressed elegantly in one of her trademark black and white outfits that match her cropped hair, is shellshocked but not going without a fight, having consulted lawyers on both sides of the Channel.She cites cultural differences between Britain and France and a resistance to change in totemic French institutions as a particular challenge.“I wanted to make the Châtelet a theatre for all citizens, not just professionals,” she says. “In the UK it’s completely accepted and normal that you can involve unpaid community members in the arts or welcome amateurs to the stage, but in France the idea of ersity, of giving power to new artists and a new audience is provocative. In France, you have to protect the paid professionals. It’s the sort of argument you’d hear in the UK 30 years ago.“For example, there’s not a single cultural institution in Britain that isn’t looking at the Black Lives Matter movement and asking how it can be more inclusive and erse, while in France there isn’t one that is.“The London Arts Council, which I chair, has been recommending training sessions to deal with institutional racism, but when I mentioned this at the Châtelet I was told if I even so much as suggested any kind of racism, people would be insulted.“I do understand there’s a universal fear of change and innovation, but that’s what I was brought in to do. That was my brief. And, in any case, we also kept the musicals.”The return of An American in Paris to the Châtelet at Christmas had indeed proved a success despite transport strikes, gilets jaunes and Extinction Rebellion protests.She is still struggling to make sense of her sacking. She says she had been informed two people from the marketing team were unhappy with her “management style” but an independent inquiry – she was interviewed on Zoom while in London laid low with coronavirus then pneumonia – cleared her of serious wrongdoing. It concluded that her failure to say “bonjour” to staff, her less than perfect command of French and her failure to turn up to a staff event to turn on Christmas lights had upset some at the theatre. Mackenzie agreed to attend training workshops and promised to take French lessons.But hours after she got the letter citing bullying as the reason for her dismissal an anonymous source was briefing influential French media that Mackenzie had been fired for a “serious fault” connected to “management and financial problems” and that she had run up a €3m (£2.68m) deficit.Mackenzie, 63, moved to Paris in 2017 from Amsterdam where she was artistic director of the Holland festival. She had previously directed Scottish Opera, run the Manchester international festival, headed the Nottingham Playhouse and overseen the 2012 London Olympics cultural programme.She says she has received dozens of messages of support from creative artists, including Steve McQueen, Elizabeth Streb, Boris Charmatz and Rokia Traoré as well as Malik.“How can Paris lose almost the only cultural leader who has put erse artists and audiences at the heart of her programme?” Malik asked. “What message does this send to the black and ethnic minority audiences and artists of France? And to do this in such a brutal way to a foreign woman? It is not just serious, it is a dangerous message about the culture and values of Paris.”Peter Sellars, the American director who worked with Mackenzie at the Châtelet, wrote: “Ruth has always had a taste and a gift for creating change. She is at home with new relationships and new audiences, courageously inviting institutions into a new era of transformative openness. Risk is at the heart of artistic practice, and Ruth is right there, supporting the artists and alive to the danger, the possibilities, and the liberation that lives at the edge …”Not all of her Châtelet projects have been a success, but she points out they were all approved by the management board and, as part of a two-person directing team, she was not solely responsible for the theatre’s financial situation.“I’m not saying there aren’t financial problems at the theatre, but there isn’t a cultural institution in the world that doesn’t have financial problems as a result of the lockdown,” she said. “And, again, this wasn’t the reason I was given for my dismissal.“I’ve been a CEO of cultural institutions for 25 years. I know how to deal correctly with budgets and finances. We got €1m from sponsors in the first season before we were forced to close because of the coronavirus.”She adds: “Anyone who knows me, who has worked with me, knows that I’m not in any way a bully. I do know what I want and am passionate about my work so I push people but I get good results.“Maybe the problem is that certain French people of a certain age, colour and class think the theatre belongs to them and someone like me who is not French shouldn’t open doors to others.”The theatre did not respond to requests for comment. Carine Rolland, the deputy mayor in charge of culture, denied a “cultural gulf” was the origin of the crisis. She told Agence France-Presse: “Ruth Mackenzie’s talent is not in question … the city must show responsibility notably when suffering, whatever its form, is expressed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3250750dad0cd8455182a2f3051ef32f5c3db7f8/0_0_5214_3128/master/5214.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c3820242a1c64e037c9e7a5665e90140","title":"fairphone 3 review ethical smartphone gets camera upgrades","story":"Pros: ethical manufacturing, sustainable materials, truly repairable, solidly built, dual sim, microSD card slot, headphones socket, removable battery, bloat-free, software support for five years, reasonable camera.Cons: middling performance, chunky, expensive for the specs, camera still not as good as rivals, no 5G."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4891eb4c30a733e7c9c444fd41cc3211da42cbd4/0_351_5270_3163/master/5270.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=3696ba24d39ea1a0178aff697d538d93","title":"menstrual cups tampons period money","story":"Marketers have encouraged us to be ashamed of periods, pushing people toward tampons. Switching to a cup changed my perspective – and saved me moneyA few years ago, I was having dinner with a group of girlfriends when one of them suddenly began raving about menstrual cups. A longtime devotee, she lit up describing how this one little product had changed her life.I’d never heard about it before, but her enthusiasm piqued my interest. Menstrual cups are reusable, medical-grade silicone devices that collect period blood, an idea I initially cringed at, since, like most people I know, I was taught menstruation was something filthy, repulsive, even. Yet my friend was persistent curiosity got the best of me.After some online research to figure out my size, I bought a medium-sized cup that fit nicely. Using it was similar to using a tampon, except I had to fold it before inserting it. Unlike my experience with tampons, I was able to forget about it for 12 hours at a time, only emptying it in the morning and at night. Soap and hot water were all I needed to sanitize it monthly, and I’ve been successfully reusing the same one for over four years now.Switching to menstrual cups was more comfortable and easier than I thought. But the shift quickly made me realize something else – I was saving a significant amount of cash. Before menstrual cups, I had never thought about the money spent on period products, because I saw them as unwaveringly necessary. And yet menstrual cups have been around just as long as modern pads and tampons. Why had I never considered this option before?Certainly, there are advantages to these products. They make our lives easier and it goes without saying that they have been hugely emancipatory. For centuries, people who menstruate dealt with their periods using all sorts of makeshift objects. Some repurposed old rags and others crafted tampon-like devices out of wool or vegetable fibers. In any case, these rudimentary alternatives kept many people on their periods alienated from public life.In the early 20th century, all of this began to change. In the first world war, nurses realized cellucotton, a material originally used for bandages, was ideal for sanitary napkins, and in 1921, Kotex, the first mass-marketed menstrual pad, hit American shelves. Tampax followed a decade later, as did a myriad of other less popular products including douches, sanitary aprons, sponges and menstrual cups. Commercial period products afforded women options and facilitated freedom.But there’s a reason tampons won out over menstrual cups.Companies were successful at branding periods as something that should be secret and shameful. Elizabeth Kissling, author of the book Capitalizing on the Curse: The Business of Menstruation, explained how this showed up in ads promoting items designed to be less readily identifiable as menstrual products, take up less space, or even packaged in “crinkle-free” wrappers that could be silently opened.Menstrual cups entail an entirely different kind of relationship to one’s body.“Inserting it requires the user to frequently touch their vulva and may often involve touching their own menstrual blood,” Kissling said . “Those demands are hard to reconcile with the pervasive cultural messages that menstruation is a dirty, contaminating force one must eliminate with the illusion of perpetual freshness.”This newfound intimacy with my body has been educative and liberating. Seeing the color, volume and consistency of my blood when disposing of it has allowed me to understand a lot more about my health – an intimate knowledge of myself I never considered important and couldn’t access when using disposable products.As for the concerns of disgust I once had, it’s been freeing to no longer feel shame about a normal process of my body. What’s more, I’ve replaced this apprehension with self-admiration for what my organism is capable of.And still, one of the most striking factors has been how much money I’ve saved because of the switch.The menstrual cup I purchased four years ago was about $25. Previously, I spent about $20 on tampons and pads monthly, since I favored (and could afford) a toxin-free version. Cheaper options cost about $10 a month – and even next to those, the menstrual cup is still a more cost-effective option.I did the math, and over 10 years, the lifetime of the average cup, the switch guarantees more than $1,000 in savings. Because of the products I favored, I’ll save over $2,300. If only I’d learned about this sooner.Feminine care companies, especially the ones that sell pads and tampons, rely on the message that people who get periods absolutely need their products, and that the other options out there could be shameful this is the familiar and unsurprising role of marketing. . Using menstrual cups for me has been a small act of resistance against that messaging. I’ve learned that I can find comfort and freedom without having to live in shame, or break the bank, for that matter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9022492d7fa82c8c122538b59923fc4037f166bc/0_1122_1720_1032/master/1720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1b95b20a06d8e106fae359b9f7bb024","title":"child 3 catches in kite strings and is lifted high into air in taiwan","story":"Girl became entangled in tail of giant kite at festival and was rescued unharmedA three-year-old girl in Taiwan has been caught up in the strings of a kite and lifted high into the air in front of horrified onlookers, before being rescued unharmed.The unidentified girl was taking part in a kite festival on Sunday in the seaside town of Nanliao, near Hsinchu City, when she became entangled in a giant, long-tailed orange kite and was hoisted off the ground by several metres.Video of the incident published in Taiwanese media showed several festival workers struggling to hold on to the lengthy tail in strong winds prior to the kite’s launch.Dozens of onlookers and families were gathered nearby, cheering as the kite took off. However the cheers quickly turned into screams as they realised the the girl has been caught by the tail, and she was launched high into the air and flung around for more than 30 seconds before operators managed to lower the kite and the child dropped relatively softly into the arms of a gathered crowd.News reports said the girl was frightened but suffered no physical injuries. Local government bureaucrat, Zhang Li Ke, said the strong winds caused the tail to wrap around the stomach of the child.Chen Ko-fang, secretary-general of the Taiwan-based Asian Kite Forum, said the kite was supposed to scatter lollies from the sky for children to catch below, Taiwan News reported. Chen said children were usually kept at a distance until the kite was in the air, but organisers weren’t expecting the sudden gusts, reported to have been a level seven on the Beaufort scale – or around 50-60km per hour.Following the incident the mayor of Hsinchu city, Lin Chih-chien, issued a statement and public apology.Lin said authorities immediately suspended all on-site activities to ensure the safety of the public in the high winds, and that municipal authorities had accompanied the family to hospital, where the young girl was cleared of injuries except some scratches to her neck.“The city government team offers its sincere apology to the victim and the public.m We will review the incident to avoid such an accident from happening again. We will also investigate responsibility and conduct an in-depth review.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fe013e5933588534d19df7824a75c88bb9ba791/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af83244086c094162793602ba580ebda","title":"covid 19 forcing schools in england to juggle pupil and financial safety","story":"Exclusive: headteachers talk of sidelining projects and making do with a fraction of what is requiredSchool leaders have said they are having to weigh up pupil safety against financial stability because their budgets have been stretched to breaking point by the burden of the coronavirus pandemic ahead of full reopening in England this week.Headteachers have been left in a bind by the closure in July of a government support fund that has not reopened in time for the uncertain return of millions of students to classrooms.The concerns over funding come as the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, used an open letter to parents in England on Sunday to urge them to send their children to school on Tuesday.Acknowledging that some may have concerns about their children attending for the first time since March, he insisted schools were safe and detailed measures put in place to minimise infection. The health risk posed to children by Covid-19 was extremely low, he said.School leaders who spoke to the , however, described desperately shuffling budgets, sidelining projects and plans and making do with a fraction of what was required.Paul Gosling of Exeter Road community primary school in Devon said he would have ideally liked to have had a cleaner on site from this week to cover shared spaces, but it would have cost £15,000 at a school whose budget may only just balance by the end of the year after many years of cuts.“I cannot plan to have a cleaner on site if I have no idea if I will be able to claim against the fund, so I am balancing safety against financial stability,” he said.The government’s coronavirus schools fund, which was introduced to cover the exceptional costs associated with the pandemic, closed on 21 July. A notice on its website says there are plans to open a “second claims window” in the autumn.Simon Kidwell, the headteacher at Hartford Manor primary school and nursery in Cheshire said he needed to find £50,000 to cover costs. This was after spending £16,000 to make the school “covid secure,” including £11,500 for the installation of 37 hand-washing stations. Losses included £7,000 in nursery fees, £21,000 for before and after-school care and a £10,000 decline in fundraising because of cancelled events.“The government say that the full opening of schools is their number one priority, however, there are no plans to support schools with additional Covid-related costs for the new academic year,” he said.Rebecca Poole, the headteacher at Hampton High in the London borough of Richmond upon Thames, said: “Our funding is really tight. Our business manager has had to cut back on other parts of our school budget and it was really only because we felt it was an absolute priority and other things will have to be sidelined.“We’ve earmarked £10,000 for laptops needed for remote learning after our IT manager negotiated some deals, but it’s really tricky. I know every budget line and it is literally about taking £500 from one budget line into another to pay. There will be things that we won’t be able to invest in.”NASUWT teachers described budgetary constraints that mean special wipes to clean desks, chairs and other surfaces are already being abandoned and replaced with improvised solutions. Others spoke of problems for schools already in debt getting worse, the burden of having to invest in more IT to prepare for remote learning and costs such as hiring more teachers for smaller classes.“Schools are facing significant additional costs in terms of the provision of PPE, additional cleaning regimes, signage and in supporting changes to the school day. These are not one-off costs but will be additional expenditure that schools will need to continue to find from their budgets while Covid-19 remains in circulation,” said Dr Patrick Roach, the NASUWT’s general secretary.“Many of our members have voiced their concerns to us that their schools will struggle to meet these costs, particularly in the context of years of cuts to education budgets. Schools need to be assured that they will be provided with the additional financial and practical resources they need to remain open without cutting corners on safety.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Headteachers, teachers and school staff have gone to enormous lengths to ensure children can get back into their classes safely when the new term starts as it is the best place for their education, development and wellbeing.“Throughout the pandemic, schools have continued to receive their core funding, with this year marking the first year of a three-year £14.4bn total cash boost. Schools have also been able to claim for specific exceptional costs such as additional cleaning required due to confirmed or suspected coronavirus cases, worth up to £75,000 for large secondary schools.”The department said that schools had been eligible to claim for costs incurred between March and July as a result of pressures such as increases associated with keeping schools open over the Easter and summer half term holidays and providing free school meals for eligible children who are not in school.The shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said: “If schools are not given additional resources then children across the country will foot the bill, with resources that should fund their education instead paying for public health measures because the government refuse to do so.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e04a1ceb6bae0127ee3e3e193be1b70c4757f56c/0_106_5469_3281/master/5469.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00205462361718355f286d8b8107f971","title":"fda covid 19 vaccine fast track","story":"FDA under intensifying pressure from Trump, who wants to see a vaccine come on stream or ready to announce before the electionPublic health experts have reacted with alarm to remarks by the head of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that he might give the green light for a US Covid-19 vaccine before the normal clinical trial process had reached its conclusion.As the US was on the verge of 6m coronavirus cases on Sunday, Stephen Hahn, the FDA commissioner, told the Financial Times in an interview published on Sunday that he was prepared to issue emergency use authorization for a Covid-19 vaccine before the end of Phase 3 human trials that put the drug through stringent testing for safety and efficacy.He said the standard he would apply instead would be “that the benefit outweighs the risk in a public health emergency”.Hahn told the newspaper that his decision would not be swayed by political pressure amid the febrile atmosphere of the upcoming US presidential election. “This is going to be a science, medicine, data decision. This is not going to be a political decision,” he said.But several public health experts expressed their concern on Sunday about an apparent willingness to consider fast-tracking a vaccine outside what is considered the gold standard testing process.The FDA has come under intensifying pressure in recent weeks from Donald Trump, who wants to see a vaccine come on stream or ready to announce before the November election, and has a public-private vaccine development funding program underway called Operation Warp Speed.Trump has openly attacked the FDA, baselessly citing a supposed “deep state” within it of dragging its feet on the vaccine approval process, despite no evidence to support the latest version of a right-wing conspiracy theory that even one of its most enthusiastic, original Trump administration propagators, Steve Bannon, has dismissed.The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 was approaching 6m in the US by Sunday afternoon, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University, while recorded deaths stand at a catastrophic 182,612 – almost a quarter of all global fatalities.Over the weekend California became the first state to pass 700,000 confirmed cases.Since the beginning of the pandemic in January, Trump has consistently downplayed the severity of the crisis and sidelined scientists, including those at the FDA.Hahn has been criticized for misleading the public about the efficacy of convalescent plasma treatment which takes blood plasma from Covid-19 survivors and injects it into sufferers.At a White House media launch last week Hahn, standing beside Trump, said the plasma treatment would save 35 lives out of every 100 patients when in fact studies put the figure at 3 to 5 lives. He was forced to apologise.Scientists and public health specialists were quick to issue warnings about Hahn’s comments about cutting short the vaccine trials.Dr Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at New York’s Columbia University, said: “We absolutely cannot tolerate or accept an emergency authorization for any Covid-19 vaccine without reliable safety and efficacy data from phase three clinical trials”.Writing on Twitter, she said it would be unethical to give the go-ahead before the trials had conclusively proved that both the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.It would place “huge numbers of people at risk for massive potential harm” and would deal “a catastrophic blow to public confidence in both vaccines and the regulatory mechanisms in place”, she wrote.Eric Topol of the Scripps Translational Research Institute said that it would take many months for the safety of the vaccine to be fully determined at trial, “irrespective of Stephen Hahn’s subservience to Trump… Any shortcuts will imperil the ultimate rollout of the vaccine and lose the public trust for getting immunized, which is already compromised.”Hahn’s predecessor as head of the FDA, Scott Gottlieb, told CBS’s Face the Nation that “I don’t know what is meant by saying before the phase 3 trials are completed… They are going to wait for these trials to read out before they can make a decision about the efficacy of these vaccines.”The news earlier this month that Russia had produced a vaccine was greeted with widespread skepticism because it had been approved and was being given to people, including one of Vladimir Putin’s daughters, before phase three trials."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7152ea7d029e15509d1580e77ccdd27d30733a9/0_27_4831_2900/master/4831.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c87c505e2868568ee459089e35522fd","title":"india sets world record of highest single day spike of covid 19 cases","story":"78,761 cases reported as government begins easing restrictions to help economyIndia has registered a record new 78,761 coronavirus cases, the world’s highest single-day increase since the pandemic began, just as the government began easing restrictions to help the country’s battered economy.The surge raised India’s tally to more than 3.5m, and came as the government announced the reopening of subways in Delhi. A limited number of sports and religious events will also be allowed from next month.A country of 1.4 billion people, India has the fastest-growing daily coronavirus caseload of any country in the world.

There was just one new death, bringing the total to 41,499.Weekend figures are typically lower than those recorded on weekdays because of delays in processing patient information. The last Saturday or Sunday when the daily number of new positive cases was above 1,715 was 17 May, when the figure was 1,838, though the preceding figures that week were significantly higher than they have been in recent days. The total is the highest number on any day since June 4.The news came as passengers who flew to Cardiff from the Greek island of Zante on a Tui flight five days ago were told to self-isolate after at least seven people on the aircraft tested positive for Covid-19.Cardiff and Vale Test Trace Protect and Public Health Wales identified at least seven confirmed cases of Covid-19 from three different groups deemed to be infectious on the flight.Last week Plymouth city council said that up to 30 teenagers in the area could have coronavirus after they flew back from Zante, with 11 members of the group – all about 18 and 19 – having tested positive.Greece is not currently on the list of countries for which travellers face quarantine restrictions. But the Foreign Office said on Friday that local restrictions had been tightened on Zante, with new limits on large gatherings, large groups in restaurants and late-night food openings.Dr Giri Shankar of Public Health Wales said of last week’s flight: “We are advising that all passengers on this flight are considered close contacts and must self-isolate. These passengers will be contacted shortly, but meanwhile, they must self-isolate at home as they may become infectious, even without developing symptoms. Anyone with symptoms should book a test without delay.”Shankar suggested that in general “a minority of the 20-30 year age group” were not following social distancing guidelines carefully enough and that their actions had “resulted in the spread of the virus to other groups of people”.Shankar said: “I would make a direct appeal to young people to remember that even if they feel that they would not be badly affected by Covid-19 if they were to test positive for it, if they were to pass it on to older or more vulnerable family members, friends or colleagues it could be extremely serious, even fatal.”The FCO’s travel advice says: “Greek authorities are likely to impose additional local coronavirus-related restrictions in certain areas, if they perceive a heightened case-rate or other valid reason in relation to that area.”It was also reported that more than 1,000 people have been tested for Covid-19 after an outbreak linked to a bingo night in Staffordshire. There are 16 known cases linked to the event at Silverdale working men’s club on 16 August, according to Staffordshire county council. It said anyone who tested positive was being told to self-isolate, while the contacts of those who tested positive were being traced.Richard Harling, the council’s director of health and care, said: “What we are seeing from test and trace activity is a widening network from the original bingo event as people met with friends and family and went out socialising.“More than 1,000 people have already been tested, but we need everyone who was at any of the venues on the given dates to get tested. This is vital in our work to identify people who may have the virus and help contain the spread of infection even further.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abb92e6c082005bb3eb1d32d8afda02fd703fccc/0_143_3127_1875/master/3127.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6cfc21f50014b2f871a20c1374ced65","title":"beirut blast ambassador firms as lebanons next pm ahead of macron visit","story":"Adib, Lebanon’s ambassador to Germany, says priority is to implement reforms and regain trustA Lebanese diplomat has been appointed to form a new government in crisis-hit Lebanon after winning the backing of major political parties.The president, Michel Aoun, asked Lebanon’s ambassador to Germany, Mustapha Adib, to form a new government after he secured 90 votes in the 128-member parliament.Adib told reporters his No 1 priority would be to quickly form a government able to implement crucial reforms to regain the trust of the Lebanese and international community.

Face coverings are required to be worn at airports and on flights unless a passenger has a medical condition that makes them exempt.“There was a chap sat next to me who had his mask around his chin for the full flight, and the stewardess was talking to him and she didn’t say anything to him,” she said.Whitfield said she was not surprised to hear about the outbreak on the flight and that she and her husband had since developed mild symptoms and were self-isolating. She added: “The flight was full of selfish ‘covidiots’ and an inept crew who couldn’t care less.”Tui said it was concerned to hear Whitfield’s claims and a full investigation was under way. It added: “The safety and wellbeing of passengers and crew is our highest priority and we operate all flights line with European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) guidelines.”Dr Gwen Lowe, a consultant in communicable disease control for Public Health Wales, said there had been about 30 confirmed coronavirus cases in Wales in the last week of people who had returned from Zante and that she was expecting the number to rise.She said the confirmed cases had included people staying at different hotels and returning on different flights. Officials are in the process of reaching all 193 people who were on Tui flight 6215 to Cardiff on 25 August.Lowe said face coverings “may help” stop the spread of the virus but that they were an “informal measure” that were difficult for airlines to police.Last week, Plymouth city council said up to 30 teenagers in the area could have coronavirus after they flew back from Zante, with 11 members of the group – aged about 18 and 19 – having tested positive.Greece is not on the list of countries for which travellers face quarantine restrictions coming into the UK.

Verbal warnings and stone-throwing were reported between the two sides.In June it escalated into a full-blown assault in Galwan Valley, the worst violence between the two sides since 1967, as soldiers engaged in hand-to-hand combat with rocks and spiked clubs at an altitude of about 4,250 metres (14,000ft), which led to the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers. The number of Chinese casualties is not known.The two sides publicly pledged to de-escalate and move troops back to their previous positions. However, multiple rounds of diplomatic and military-level discussion have failed to make progress and India and China have remained in a deadlock.Chinese troops remain at key Indian posts in Pangong Lake, continuing to build roads, helipads and radar towers, and in recent days China was reported to have deployed fighter jets near the border. In response, India has continued to build up infrastructure on its side of the “line of actual control”, and continued to carry out air patrols.On Monday, Beijing claimed Chinese border troops “never cross the line of actual control”. “Both sides are in communication regarding the situation on the ground,” the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a news briefing.Commanders from both sides met on Monday in the Ladakh village of Chushul to try to resolve the issue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6e12e70da3f7d17f34de51222081efdf0a7e723/0_405_3850_2311/master/3850.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd041556d3cccbba00d7f4e7db55382e","title":"coronavirus live news us infections near 6m uk records highest cases since june","story":"Midwestern states report record infections Russia reports almost 5,000 new cases Australia reports highest daily death tollThe European commission is negotiating advance purchases of vaccines with several drugmakers on behalf of the 27 EU states and has said in past weeks EU governments cannot buy vaccines through parallel procurement schemes.The commission added that it was ready, together with EU states, to “put expertise and resources at work within Covax to accelerate and scale-up development and manufacturing of a global supply of vaccines for citizens across the world, in poor and rich countries”.The European commission will contribute €400m (£352m, $476m) in guarantees to a World Health Organization initiative to buy vaccines, it has said.

The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who announced his resignation on Friday for health reasons, said on the same day the government would increase testing capacity to 200,000 a day. But a highly bureaucratic approval process means Japan has one of the lowest testing regimes among major economies, carrying out about 14 tests per 1,000 people, compared with 36 in South Korea and 246 in the United States. Patients wanting to be tested must go through telephone consultations, demonstrate they have symptoms or show they have been in touch with an infected person. Health ministry authorities must then approve the test and have in some cases refused to authorise them. The policy focus should be on speeding up the turnaround time of testing, tracing contacts and empowering medical professionals, said Fumie Sakamoto, the infection control manager at St Luke’s International Hospital in Tokyo. “Tests should be performed based on medical judgment and not on patients’ requests,” Sakamoto said. Abe’s pledge would mark a sharp rise from Japan’s current capacity of about 52,000 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and 8,000 antigen tests a day. But actual PCR testing has been less than half the capacity over the past month, averaging 20,000 per day. “Rather than 200,000 tests a day, I think it’s more important that each municipality has a system that allows doctors to perform the tests they consider necessary,” said Koji Wada, professor of public health at the International University of Health and Welfare in Tokyo. Early in the crisis, the World Health Organization director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, urged countries to “test, test, test” to tackle what he called “the defining global health crisis of our time”. But Satoru Hashimoto, who directs the intensive care ision at Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, said there was no proof that increasing testing would prevent deaths. Testing everyone regardless of symptoms “takes a huge amount of resources and brings very limited benefit”, he said.Daiichi Sankyo Co said on Monday that its MRNA-based Covid-19 vaccine candidate had been selected for inclusion in a drug discovery programme by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development.

Ghana will reopen its international airport on Tuesday but with new regulations in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus, the president has announced.Kotoka international airport, outside the capital, Accra, was closed in March along with other border points in an effort to contain the virus in the west African country. “I am glad to announce that Kotoka international airport will reopen and resume operations from Tuesday, 1 September 2020,” the president, Nana Akufo-Addo, said in a nationwide broadcast late on Sunday.He said land borders would remain closed.New safety measures have been imposed to prevent passengers bringing the virus into the country. “Any passenger arriving in Ghana must be in possession of a negative Covid-19 PCR test result from an accredited laboratory in the country of origin,” he said. The test should have been done not more than 72 hours before their departure.All airlines are to ensure compliance with the directive for passengers wishing to travel to Ghana, Akufo-Addo said.In addition, arriving passengers must undergo a Covid-19 test at the airport terminal at their own cost, though children under five will be exempt.“Passengers who test positive for Covid-19 will be handled by the health authorities for further clinical assessment and management.”The virus has so far infected 44,205 people and claimed 276 lives in the country of around 30 million people.Hong Kong will resume face-to-face school classes from 23 September as the Asian financial hub’s authorities aim to wind back strict coronavirus restrictions, which kept about 900,000 students working at home for over four months.Kevin Yeung, the city’s education secretary, said the resumption would be phased with grades 1, 5 and 6 resuming for secondary schools, primary schools and upper kindergartens on 23 September, while other grades would open on 29 September.The city’s government had said at the start of August that face-to-face classes would be suspended indefinitely as the Chinese special administrative region battled to control a third wave of the coronavirus.The reversal in policy comes with new daily cases dropping substantially to single and low double-digits from triple digits a few weeks earlier. The Chinese government is also offering mass coronavirus testing for all Hong Kong residents starting this week. Schools in the former British colony have been mostly shut since January with many having switched to online learning. The switch to online has frustrated teachers, parents and students and exacerbated the learning gap between the haves and have-nots.More than two-thirds of parents, regardless of income, believe their children have difficulty learning at home, according to a February survey by the Education University of Hong Kong.

The Philippines reported on Monday 3,446 coronavirus infections and 38 deaths, taking its total caseload to 220,819 and fatalities to 3,558, its health ministry said. The ministry also said on Monday that five Philippine hospitals have been identified as candidates for potential clinical trials of a Covid-19 vaccine manufactured by the China-based Sinovac Biotech.More than 1,700 people in the UK have been reported to have tested positive for coronavirus, the largest weekend number since the middle of May.The government figures, published on Sunday, which showed a further 1,715 positive tests, continue a worrying trend of a growing number of cases since the beginning of July, amid persistent concerns over a second spike in the autumn.The cases bring the total number to 334,467. There was one new death, bringing the total to 41,499.Weekend figures are typically lower than those recorded on weekdays because of delays in processing patient information. The last Saturday or Sunday when the daily number of new positive cases was above 1,715 was 17 May, when the figure was 1,838, though the preceding figures that week were significantly higher than they have been in recent days. The total is the highest number on any day since 4 June.The news came as passengers who flew to Cardiff from the Greek island of Zante on a Tui flight five days ago were told to self-isolate after at least seven people on the aircraft tested positive for Covid-19.Russia reported 4,993 new cases of the coronavirus on Monday, bringing its nationwide tally to 995,319, the fourth largest caseload in the world. Russia’s coronavirus taskforce said 83 people had died over the last 24 hours, pushing the official death toll to 17,176. At a factory south of Japan’s Toyota City, robots have started sharing the work of quality-control inspectors, as the pandemic accelerates a shift from Toyota’s vaunted “go and see” system that helped revolutionise mass production in the 20th century. Inside the auto-parts plant of Musashi Seimitsu Industry Co Ltd, a robotic arm picks up and spins a bevel gear, scanning its teeth against a light in search of surface flaws. The inspection takes about two seconds – similar to that of highly trained employees who check about 1,000 units per shift. “Inspecting 1,000 of the exact same thing day-in day-out requires a lot of skill and expertise, but it’s not very creative,” the chief executive, Hiroshi Otsuka, told Reuters. “We’d like to release workers from those tasks.” Global manufacturers have long used robots in production while leaving the knotty work of spotting flaws mainly to humans. But social distancing measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 have prompted a rethink of the factory floor. That has spurred the increased use of robots and other technology for quality control, including remote monitoring, which was already being adopted before the pandemic. India reported 78,512 coronavirus infections on Monday, more than any other country but fewer than the previous day, when it posted the world’s biggest, single-day tally, as authorities looked to open more sectors of the economy. On Sunday, India’s total of 78,761 new cases exceeded the previous global record of 77,299 in the US on July 16, a Reuters tally of official data showed. The world’s second-most populous country has been posting the highest single-day caseload in the world since 7 Aug ust. At 3.62 million cases, India is fast catching up to the US and Brazil in terms of total cases but it has a lower death rate.India’s coronavirus deaths went up by 971 in the past 24 hours, taking the tally to 64,469, the health ministry said. The huge numbers have got authorities worried, especially with people in rural areas largely abandoning rules aimed at stopping the spread, officials say. Kumar Sanjay Krishna, the chief secretary of Assam, one of the worst-hit states, attributed the increasing cases to more testing, the opening of the economy and complacency. “People are not following precautionary steps and are violating the Covid-19 protocols,” he said on Twitter. “From Monday onwards there shall be visible strict action taken against those who violate the norms of social distancing or found not wearing a face mask.” But at the same time, fears are growing for the world’s fifth-largest economy, with a contraction in gross domestic product for the June quarter expected to be announced later on Monday. Hoping to avert more serious economic damage, the government is relaxing restrictions and has announced that urban metro trains can resume services from 7 September. In the UK, independent shops are unlikely to join the government’s push to get workers back to the office, according to the body representing the sector, after enjoying a boost in sales thanks to a drop in commuting.Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association (BIRA), said members in suburban areas and towns had reported positive sales throughout lockdown and beyond as they pick up business that would usually go to those working in the city centre.He said: “You won’t find us on this call to get people back to the office for many reasons. I think that horse has bolted, and I understand why people are calling for it but people will come back on a more flexible approach … City centres now have to think, with fewer people commuting, what do we do to bring people back in?”Surinder Josan, the owner of DIY in Birmingham, a shop selling tools and other items used in the home and on activities such as gardening, said: “We entered the lockdown quite nervous thinking we would have to coast for six months … so we stayed closed for two weeks and spent that time clearing up and tidying up. While we were doing that our lights were on and the doors were closed and people were knocking asking to purchase stuff for repairs, and the phone was ringing.“Then when the sun was shining, people came more. We put a notice outside saying, ‘Wait outside to be served’, and we were serving people one by one and using PPE. We tried to do the best we could.”He added that as lockdown has eased customers have started drifting back. “Whereas queues at big stores were horrendous and getting something online would take weeks, customers were coming back to us and we saw customers we had never seen before,” he said.Another business doing well is the children’s shop the Baker of Small Stuff in Sheffield. Hellen Stirling, the owner, said: “We were lucky because the day we were told to close, we had already got our website set up. I put all my efforts and work into the website which went bonkers in a brilliant way.” She added that there was a feeling in the air to “shop with your local high street and community” which has driven a lot of custom."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc866a6b06c35feb8646a39ab64853d2b0771bbc/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edf53a18574ef09e81afaa8ada8b85f7","title":"how britains high streets are recovering after lockdown visual analysis","story":"Data reveals that three in 10 shops hadn’t reopened after coronavirus restrictions were lifted – with some areas lagging further behind than othersFollowing the reopening of the UK’s retail and hospitality sectors through June and July, there were hopes that the economic damage of the coronavirus pandemic could be lessened.The findings point to inner cities struggling as lockdown was lifted, with vast swathes of London lying quiet, restaurant chains and shops announcing closures and thousands of high streets jobs having already been lost.The University of Oxford Covid-19 Impact Monitor also shows that footfall on high streets has struggled to return to pre-lockdown levels, with visitors to inner-city areas down by half at the start of August. Tourists have helped boost footfall in some seaside towns recently, but these areas are still facing shop closures.While inner-city areas and those that rely on tourism were among the hardest-hit in July, other areas were less affected, relying on a stay-at-home local community to sustain the high street.By visiting areas of London, the north-west and Cornwall on a day between 10 and 20 July and counting which properties were open, researchers were able to ascertain which areas and sectors were struggling most in the immediate wake of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic.Manchester’s commercial office area of Spinningfields is home to Manchester crown court, banks such as Barclays and HSBC and a cluster of restaurants that serve the area’s high number of office workers.Before lockdown, Spinningfields had a local economy catering for its office workers: restaurants, bars, pubs and health and beauty outlets were common in the areaDuring lockdown, almost all of the area\u0027s outlets closed as office workers were asked to work from home. A handful of banks and food shops remained openThe mix of outlets on Sale’s streets is more erse than Spinningfields, with hairdressers, fast food and household supplies being more common. These outlets did close as lockdown forced hundreds of Sale’s shops to shutLondon is also suffering from the same inner-city desertion as Manchester. While research from the Local Data Company shows that central London areas have low reopening rates, areas further out have benefited from people staying at home and enjoying their local communities.The commuter area of Ealing has a similar spread of outlets to Sale, with health and beauty and restaurants being popular in the areaData from the Oxford Covid-19 Impact Monitor shows that almost three times as many visitors are vsiting St Ives as at the start of March. But this rise in tourists looking to enjoy a staycation doesn’t tell the whole story, with many of the town’s shops having not immediately opened after July’s relaxation of restrictions.St Ives relies heavily on a hospitality sector serving large numbers of tourists looking to enjoy the Cornish coast. Alongside these outlets, it also had a high number of shops selling books, arts and crafts, food and fashion before lockdownLike Sale and Ealing, Kendal’s mix of shops points to a local community that relies on the high street. Health and beauty, cafes and clothing shops were the most popular outlets before lockdownWhen lockdown hit, over 300 shops closed, leaving just 68 open — mostly catering for health, food and medicineLucy Stainton, head of retail and strategic partnerships at the Local Data Company, said: “Evidence from our initial research shows a real contrast between locations where people live and areas where people work. This might be unsurprising given many office workers are still opting to base themselves from home thereby decimating footfall in inner-city locations. However, these are incredibly important economic hubs and so what happens next will be critical.“Going forwards, the outlook for these urban centres remains very uncertain as we can expect most office workers to remain at home for the coming months, at least part-time, which will continue to significantly depress footfall across these locations. This coupled with the inevitable contraction in discretionary spend that comes with a recession will exacerbate the challenges city centres and fashion-retail hubs will face, especially when you factor in the higher rents these areas often demand.“On a more positive note, we have already seen local markets get a boost from higher activity levels from home workers and a local catchment which is unwilling to travel too far. This, at least in the short to medium term is where the opportunities lie for our retailers, finding ways to serve a local population facing the fall-out from such an unexpected and unprecedented global event.”The Local Data Company visited each of these five areas before lockdown (as at March 2020), during lockdown (based on government guidance from 23 March on what could remain open and desktop research from company websites in MarchApril 2020), and after lockdown (in July, after the easing of restrictions on 4 July). In each case, a team of field researchers visited known shops in their database to assess whether they were open or closed. This analysis was then able to produce a snapshot of each area’s reopening rates at any given time.Footfall data was computed by the Oxford Covid-19 Impact Monitor by processing location data from the Local Data Company and Cuebiq’s mobile phone location data. They first map out the locations and then, using anonymised mobile phone location data, determine when users stop for more than five minutes in a particular store. If a user stops for more than five minutes within 100 metres of a store, they are treated as having visited that place.

Photograph: David JonesPA Wire Leaving Cert students are set to receive fresh details this week over how the calculated grades process has been adjusted to try to make results as fair and accurate as possible.The Department of Education is expected to this week release technical details of how the calculated grades system has been completed and refined in light of expert advice and controversy in the United Kingdom.Disadvantaged students were found to have been disproportionately downgraded compared to others in the UK system, which led to an outcry and a government U-turn to reinstate teachers’ predicted grades.Sources say the Irish system now differs from the UK version in at least three crucial respects.Teachers’ estimated marks for inidual students will carry a much greater weight in the Irish system compared to the UK, it is understood.In addition, teachers’ estimated marks for inidual students are in the form of per centages rather than grade bands, as was the case in the UK. This, say department officials, should allow for greater accuracy.National performanceFurthermore, it is claimed that the Irish system is designed to allow for exceptional students to be recognised, even in a class or school which has historically underperformed.Calculated grades – which replaced the summer Leaving Cert exams – are based on a combination of teachers’ estimated marks for students and a standardisation process to ensure the national performance is similar to previous years. Some 61,000 students are due to receive their results at 9am on Monday, September 7th.The new details of how the system will operate is unlikely to satisfy opposition parties who have criticised an element of the standardisation process know as “school profiling” .This is a reference to how historical data for student achievement across inidual schools is set to form part of the standardisation process.Labour’s education spokesman Aodhán Ó Ríordáin TD said this element should be taken out of the process as it threatens to “doubly disadvantage” students from less well-off backgrounds.Department sources, however, say the Irish system has been carefully constructed to ensure students are not unfairly disadvantaged on socio-economic grounds.It is understood that the calculated grades process, meanwhile, is largely complete and verification checks are taking place.Students, who receive their results next Monday, will have to wait four days after their results to receive CAO officers.Some education sources say the fact that our college offers system is different to the UK’s may take some of the heat out of controversy linked to students’ calculated grades.In the UK, students received conditional college offers based on their predicted grades. However, in Ireland the CAO operates on the basis of supply and demand, along with students’ relative performance, which should provide more flexibility for movements in grades.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"A speed limit is fairer than a fuel tax, which affects the less well-off to a greater degreeThe teenager elicits hope, admiration and even awe in people many times her ageDismantling of protections \u0026lsquois making it harder for future administrations to use science\u0026rsquo"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: A new survey brings arresting confirmations of declineThe by-the-wind sailor\u0026rsquos sworn foe, the violet sea snail, floats upside-down alongside itMichael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalities"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Sweden’s Covid-19 death rate is considerably higher than in many other countries but the pace of new infections and deaths has slowed markedly since the end of June. Photograph Martin von KroghGetty ImagesOne of the World Health Organisation’s six special envoys on Covid-19 has highlighted Sweden’s virus response as a model that other countries should be emulating in the long run.Dr David Nabarro, speaking in a radio interview in New Zealand, said, “For all countries, the real approach we’ve got to aim for is through behaviour that’s adopted everywhere.”Dr Nabarro said the key to a sustainable coronavirus strategy is trust, and pointed to Sweden as a case in point. The Nordic nation imposed far fewer restrictions on movement than others, and instead relied on Swedes to act responsibly and embrace the guidelines laid out by the country’s health authorities.“In Sweden, the government was able to trust the public and the public was able to trust the government,” Dr Nabarro told Magic Talk.Sweden’s Covid-19 death rate is considerably higher than in many other countries, at 57 per 100,000. But the pace of new infections and deaths has slowed markedly since the end of June. The development prompted Sweden’s national health agency to propose raising the limit on certain public gatherings to 500 people from 50.In contrast, other governments around the world are once again imposing stricter measures amid a resurgence in cases.Dr Nabarro described a lockdown as “a blunt instrument” that “really bites into the livelihoods of everybody, particularly poorer people and small businesses.”Speaking on RTÉ Radio on Monday, Dr Nabarro reiterated the WHO’s advice on masks, saying children aged between six and 11 years should wear a mask if there appeared to be a high risk of the virus in the community.“It’s not a one size fits all instruction but it’s guidance based on the best available evidence,” he told Morning Ireland.Dr Nabarro paid tribute to the people of Ireland their efforts to date with the advice “don’t give up, keep the fight up, keep all the elements that we’ve got in place so we can have a comprehensive response to this virus and let’s keep ahead of it because otherwise the virus will beat us and knock us down”.In response to the envoy’s remarks on Sweden, the director-general of the Swedish public health agency, Johan Carlson, said in an interview with newspaper Svenska Dagbladet: “We are one of the few countries with a limited spread of infection, unlike several countries in Europe where the infection is returning sharply.”“I call it the champagne cork effect,” Mr Carlson said.But Sweden’s Covid strategy still has many critics, including from within the country. Fredrik Elgh, a professor of virology at Umea University, points to the high death toll as evidence the light-touch approach has failed.“We have almost 6,000 dead. We have betrayed our elderly,” he said in the Svenska Dagbladet report. “We should test and trace infection much more. But the Public Health Agency does not want that.”Mr Carlson of the public health agency and Sweden’s minister for health and social affairs, Lena Hallengren, are due to hold a press conference on the country’s Covid strategy later on Monday. - Bloomberg "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4342312.1598827376!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"north s coronavirus infection rate significantly higher than republic s","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn electron microscope image of the Sars-cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19. Photograph: US National Institutes of Health via APThe rate of new coronavirus infections in Northern Ireland is now “significantly higher” than in the Republic of Ireland or the UK as a whole, the North’s chief scientific officer has warned. On Friday the number of cases per 100,000 in Northern Ireland over 14 days was 38.6, according to Prof Ian Young, compared with the European Centre for Disease Control’s figure of 31.1 in the Republic and 23.2 in the UK. Prof Young told The  he did not have a “simple explanation” for the increased infection rate in the North, which had performed “much better” than the rest of the UK earlier in the pandemic. “In particular, I don’t know whether our population are adhering less well to restrictions than the population in England, Scotland and Wales, which is the obvious thing to think about, but it’s very hard to get accurate comparative data.” However, while the North’s figures were currently higher than those in the Republic, he said the numbers fluctuated and the outbreaks remained “broadly similar” on both sides of the Border. “We’re both dealing with outbreaks associated with meat factories, we both observe greater number of cases in the major urban settings, particularly Belfast and Dublin, and we both have much lower incidence in some of the rural settings.” Concerns have been voiced throughout the pandemic that the existence of the Border could hamper the fight against coronavirus. However, Prof Young said the presence of the Border had had little impact on the spread of the virus or the fight against it, with the exception at the start of the outbreak of the “beneficial” early changes in behaviour by some people in the North, which he said was in part a result of the measures which had been introduced in the Republic. International travelIn regard to international travel through Dublin, Prof Young said the impact had “largely been neutral. If people weren’t coming in through Dublin they’d be coming in through London. “The evidence we have from our test, trace and protect service is that only a very small proportion of our cases at present are associated with travel, so we don’t think that’s a significant driver at the moment in terms of increased case numbers.” There is also, he said, “very good communication and collaboration with our colleagues in the Republic”, with conversations taking place at a minimum once a week, and contact tracing operating on a cross-border basis.The number of coronavirus cases in the North has increased tenfold since early July, with most cases now among younger people. The reproduction – “R” – rate has been consistently above one since the beginning of August, and hospital admissions and bed occupancy figures have also been rising. Over the weekend the North’s department of health reported 138 new cases, bringing the total number of cases since the beginning of the pandemic to 7,187. Prof Young said he was “concerned” at the increase in case numbers, which he described as “steady and progressive and if anything is gathering pace”, and in particular in Belfast, where 134 cases have been identified in the last seven days.

Photograph: Getty ImagesMore than half of people working from home in Ireland are sitting down for an average of two hours and 40 minutes longer per day than when they were working in an office, a new survey has found.The findings have prompted warnings to this new cohort of Covid-19 pandemic home workers of increased risk of stroke and heart disease.The Irish Heart Foundation (IHF) commissioned the survey carried out by Ipsos MRBI, which interviewed 1,007 people by phone. It found that more than half of all workers surveyed have been able to work from home since coronavirus restrictions began, with 53 per cent of them sitting down for longer than when in their office or usual place of work.The research conducted between August 1st and 10th also found that one in four of those who are sitting for longer are remaining sedentary for at least three hours more than previously.‘Crucial’John Barton, a consultant cardiologist, told The  that “if you don’t exercise, you’re looking for trouble”. He said that remaining active is “crucial” for overall health.“You’ve got to work exercise into your day. I’ve a treadmill at home that I used during Covid-19,” Mr Barton said. Exercise is “ very, very good for cardiovascular health, mental health, maintaining a normal weight, and helping to prevent cancers. There’s a link between obesity and cancers,” he said. Tara Curran, physical activity co-ordinator at the IHF, said sitting at work all day can “increase a person’s risk of heart disease and stroke”.“As working from home and video meetings become the norm, workers are increasingly tied to their laptops for hour after hour,” Ms Curran said. “We are urging them to get up and move regularly during their working day and would like to see employers make an effort to shorten meeting times on video conferencing.”Move a minuteThe survey is part of IHF’s Escape Your Chair Heart Month campaign, supported by the HSE, which calls on the nation to get up and move for a minute each hour during the day.Fitness expert Karl Henry emphasised the need to move regularly to counteract the negative effects of sitting down.“Being physically active can release endorphins that can help relieve stress, boost mood, and improve self-esteem,” he said. “When we find ourselves in a stressful situation at work, a quick stroll can help clear our heads while also helping our hearts and reducing our sitting time.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"More than 270,000 departures in July this year compared to 73,900 in JuneKerry TD Michael Healy-Rae says all pubs, not just ones that serve food, should reopenOpen letter assures public health teams will protect students and staff throughout returnGarda\u0026iacute investigating cause of blaze at four-bedroom property near CarnmoreDeceased was found unconscious outside a hotel on the Muckross Road on SaturdayDr David Nabarro describes lockdown as \u0026lsquoa blunt instrument\u0026rsquo that harms livelihoodsEmergency card to give peace of mind to carers should something unexpected happenFishermen say there is no right to challenge the points if applied for breaches of rulesCentre\u0026rsquos founder warns students are particularly vulnerable during freshers\u0026rsquo weekMinisters to meet campaigners to examine which events can be further reopenedThe man was found unconscious outside hotel in Co Kerry town on Saturday nightPeople with dementia reported to display increased confusion, aggression, anxietyPrivate hospitals surprised at HSE\u0026rsquos plan to report to Government refusal to sign upSome, including initial proponent Mary Harney, argue the ban should be nationwideThe new group will identify risks in Garda early \u0026lsquoso controversies are forestalled\u0026rsquoOnly a small proportion of North\u0027s new cases linked with international travel, expert saysResidents of St Mary\u0026rsquos facility face uncertain future amid liquidation processGroup supporting Co Meath widow want Minister to clarify nature of the investigationGovernment said to be increasingly likely to submit just one nominee despite request61,000 students are due to receive their calculated results at 9am on September 7thStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4342794.1598873115!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"july sees increase in international travel but numbers way down on last year","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOf the 227,300 persons arriving in Ireland in July, 188,100 arrived by air, and 39,200 by sea.The number of people travelling in and out of Ireland increased substantially in July but overall levels remain almost 90 per cent below 2019.New data compiled by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) showed the number of people leaving the country rose from 73,900 in June to 275,400 in July, an increase of 273 per cent, in line with an easing of Covid-19 related restrictions.

The Minister intends to examine both indoor and outdoor events as part of this process.This would mean gigs may get the green light to proceed potentially without alcohol sales and possibly with larger attendance figures.Under current Government guidelines, only businesses or services such as museums, cinemas, theatres and art galleries can allow a maximum 50 people to congregate indoors because they are deemed to be “controlled environments”. At present all other indoor cultural events are subject to the six-person-maximum rule.“I hope it will assist everyone in developing a better understanding of how we can move forward and strike an appropriate balance between protecting our public health in an effort to ensuring events of greater numbers than current restrictions inside and outside can take place where possible,” Ms Martin said.New powersMeanwhile, the Government will on Monday publish fresh legislation detailing what new powers gardaí will be given to crack down on restaurant and pub owners who do not comply with public-health guidelines.A draft copy of legislation seen by The  states that pub and restaurant owners who reopen their premises during the period of a closure order could face a fine of €5,000 and one year in jail on conviction.The legislation also states that where gardaí have obtained an emergency or temporary closure order, the licence-holder will have to affix a notice outside the building . Anyone who fails to do this will be fined €2,500.These measures come in addition to the new powers being introduced to allow gardaí to close a premises for one day, seven days and 30 days depending on the level of non-compliance. The legislation is due to come before the Dáil this week.However, when the Dáil’s business committee met last Friday, Opposition politicians expressed concern that the Government was attempting to push new powers through the Oireachtas too quickly. Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy told the meeting that legislation was being rushed through the Dáil and that this could result in politicians being “caught out” by unintentional mistakes.On Sunday, the Department of Health confirmed another 42 cases of Covid-19. There were no new deaths for the eighth day in a row. Fifteen cases were confirmed as being associated with outbreaks or close contacts of a confirmed case, with six were identified as community transmission.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe The Government has not yet decided if it will nominate two candidates for the post of EU commissioner despite a request from president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen to put forward one man and one woman.Senior Government sources believe it is increasingly likely the Government will nominate one candidate instead with the current Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney seen as the frontrunner.Fine Gael MEP Mairead McGuinness confirmed on Sunday that she would be interested in succeeding Phil Hogan as Ireland’s European Commissioner and suggested it would be “unwise” for the Government not to put forward both male and female candidates for the role.A spokeswoman for the Government said that the three party leaders met on Friday to discuss the issue and would meet again on Monday, and there had also been contacts over the weekend.“It is in everyone’s interest to fill the vacancy as soon as possible but there is a process in Brussels as well with president and parliament.” ‘Difficult patch’Mr Hogan resigned from his position following controversy over his attendance at an Oireachtas golf society dinner and questions around his movements throughout Ireland before and afterwards in apparent breach of Covid-19 guidelines. Speaking on Sunday, Ms McGuinness said she was interested in the role. “My name is in circulation and yes I’m interested in being the commissioner,” she said on the This Week programme on RTÉ Radio 1. “But, as we all know, the decision is a government’s decision. We’ve been through quite a difficult patch over the last couple of days. Our name in Europe is being spoken of in ways we would rather it wasn’t. “The president of the commission was very clear that she wants nominations soon so that we can move on from the place we are in. There are a lot of other names there as well, but my name is among them.“I think we need to listen very carefully to what the president of the commission Ursula von der Leyen has actually said. She wants the Government to act swiftly, and she wants two names. She wants a woman and a man.” ‘In the mix’Ms McGuinness said nobody from Government circles had sounded her out about the position yet, but admitted she been in contact with one senior figure for advice on the matter. “I think because of my position as first vice-president of the parliament that my name was in the mix early on,” she said. “I spoke to one person who is a good friend of mine for advice.”In relation to Ireland’s chances of retaining the key trade portfolio, Ms McGuinness said there was too much emphasis on that aspect of the discussion in Ireland. “This is about someone who is committed to Europe,” she said. “I think we have forgotten that here in Ireland. We have focused on Ireland’s interests as if they are exclusive and different from European. “Whoever gets this position – man or woman – will be a European commissioner, clearly with an Irish background, but not batting only for Ireland.” Ms McGuinness also said Ireland’s reputation had suffered in Europe as a result of the controversy, but not “in the sense that we cannot recover”.“I think it’s very clear that when any member state is at the centre of a difficult crisis or controversy that lasts over a number of days it’s not good news for us and it’s an uncomfortable position,” she said.

Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"32 year old russian opposition leader vows keep movement going","story":"Lyubov Sobol was already among the most visible dissidents in Vladimir Putin’s Russia. At 32, she has fronted a protest movement, calling thousands to the streets when she and other opposition candidates were barred from standing in Moscow city elections last year.She staged a hunger strike and a sit-in at the offices of the Moscow election commission, eventually being lifted out of the building on a sofa after she refused to stand for police officers. A laughing Ms Sobol broadcast the incident live from her phone to her vast social media following.She has been sued by one of the most powerful businessmen in the country, and her husband has survived a poisoning. In 2016 an unknown assailant jabbed a syringe into his leg and injected a psychotropic substance that left him convulsing and unconscious, an attack Ms Sobol believes was linked to her activism.Now, with opposition leader Alexei Navalny in a coma in a German hospital after another suspected poisoning, the telegenic lawyer finds herself at the helm of his anti-Kremlin organisation.Doctors at Berlin’s Charite Hospital, where Mr Navalny was transferred from a Siberian clinic, have said he will probably survive the ordeal but may sustain long-term damage.Neither they nor his supporters know when, or even if, he will return to his previous role.Tests at the hospital showed Mr Navalny was poisoned with a “cholinesterase inhibitor”, a group of chemical compounds that includes Novichok, the nerve agent that was used against former Russian intelligence agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury.Mr Navalny’s team have laid the blame for the attack squarely on Russian authorities, but the Kremlin rejected the claims as “empty noise” and accused German doctors of “rushing to conclusions”.Ms Sobol is part of a trio that have vowed to keep up the pressure of authorities in Mr Navalny’s absence. While she runs his YouTube channels - which have a combined six million subscribers and produce regular reports of wrongdoing among the Russian elite - lawyer Ivan Zhdanov heads Mr Navalny’s anti-corruption foundation and top aide Leonid Volkov oversees political campaigning.In an interview with the , Ms Sobol said the group had no intention of scaling back their broadcasts or corruption investigations.They also plan to campaign against the ruling United Russia party in regional elections next month. Mr Navalny’s group no longer fields candidates itself but encourages supporters to vote for whoever has the best chance of beating United Russia, whether they be from communist or nationalist parties.“I’m working 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” said Ms Sobol, who has worked with Mr Navalny for a decade.“Any injustice gives me more strength and motivates me to work harder.”Before he fell suddenly ill on a flight to Moscow from Siberia ten days ago, Mr Navalny spent months at a time under house arrest or in jail, and relied on a team of legal staff, researchers and other dissidents to keep up pressure on the Kremlin.“There are dozens of people in our organisation all across the country,” Ms Sobol said, pointing to offices in 40 regions of Russia. “These are people who are professional and they are idealistic - they don’t need a boss to make sure they’re in the office from nine to five.”And she argued the poisoning had also made an impression on the general public. “People who were indifferent to the authorities and the opposition have come round to our side because they’ve seen the dirty methods the Kremlin uses.”The dangers of working against Mr Putin, however, are well documented: over his 20-year rule, dissidents have been attacked, poisoned, tried, exiled and, in the case of former opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, assassinated.Mr Navalny himself is partially blind in one eye after an assailant threw green dye in his face on a Moscow street in 2017. Last year he was hospitalised from prison, where he was serving a short term for organising unauthorised protests, with what officials said was an “acute allergic reaction” but he believed was a poisoning.Ms Sobol said she was “saddened but not surprised” by the latest alleged attack.“But I can’t resign myself to the idea that this is normal life. If it can happen to Alexei Navalny, someone who’s known all over the world, it means not a single person can feel safe.“We all understand what we have to do to continue our fight against the Putin regime.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc has real chance reform losing sight purpose","story":"If the BBC\u0027s new director-general was in any doubt about the scale of the challenge he faces in reforming the corporation, events this week will have made it painfully clear.Tim Davie, who takes up his post next week, has already been forced to intervene to bring some much needed common sense to the BBC\u0027s consideration of removing the patriotic anthem Rule, Britannia from the Last Night of the Proms.It seems BBC bosses were so fearful of causing offence to woke activists who claimed the song was racist, they ended up outraging the vast majority of the public who are proud of their country, its heritage and its traditions.What the Rule, Britannia debacle shows is that BBC decision makers have lost sight of who they are working for and are basing decisions on their own sensibilities, rather than the values and views of the audience they are supposed to serve.The BBC has been culturally captured by the woke-dominated group think of some of its own staff. There is a default Left-leaning attitude from a metropolitan workforce mostly drawn from a similar social and economic background.When the BBC moved some of its output out of London, it simply replaced metropolitan London with metropolitan Manchester, Leeds or Glasgow.The BBC has strict editorial guidelines and processes to ensure the sensibilities and sensitivities of its audience are paramount. But all too often, as one insider put it to me, BBC staff are making programmes for other BBC staff - not for licence fee payers.Once the gold standard of impartial, fair and accurate news, BBC journalists are increasingly letting their political preferences show. This can range from subtle bias, such as liking certain tweets, to flagrant breaches of the BBC\u0027s impartiality rules - such as Lewis Goodall, Newsnight\u0027s policy editor, grabbing the cover story of Left-wing magazine New Statesman, with his attack on the handling of exam grading.Over time, BBC\u0027s news teams have focused on other priorities than impartiality - such as making an impact for a particular programme or raising the profile of inidual journalists.Social media has eaten away at BBC impartiality, encouraging staff to see online success in terms of the number of followers or the number of times a post is liked or retweeted. That leads to news programmes seeking controversy and the car-crash interview while journalists blur the line between reporting and political commentary.There is an obvious long-term recruitment challenge for Mr Davie to grapple with but the BBC also requires more urgent reform.The erosion of BBC staff\u0027s online impartiality is subject to an internal review, the results of which will be revealed by Mr Davie in a keynote speech on the corporation\u0027s reform next week. But top-down decrees for a change of direction, no matter how correct, will fall foul of the pervading BBC culture unless enforced with radical action.The BBC\u0027s editorial decisions are devolved to departmental heads, programme editors, item producers, reporters and presenters. That means, unless calls for reform come with a new system that rewards programme impartiality and is accompanied by rigorous enforcement, nothing will change.The BBC\u0027s referendum coverage shows it is more than capable of enforcing impartiality. At the start of the EU referendum campaign, senior BBC executives and news editors met to discuss how to cover what promised to be one of the most potentially isive political events in modern history. There was widespread concern that, regardless of outcome, the losing side in the debate would seek to blame BBC bias in part for the result. It led to the imposition of an impartiality first culture throughout the campaign.Programme commissions were regularly checked to ensure they represented a wide spectrum of views. It was used most notably to prevent soap operas, dramas and specials - from Countryfile to EastEnders - from injecting anti-Brexit political script lines just because it was deemed topical. On news output, everything from running orders and language to guest bookings were subjected to the impartiality test.Yet almost as soon as Britain\u0027s verdict was delivered, the rigorous rules were relaxed and anti-Brexit bias and metropolitan group think crept back into the corporation\u0027s coverage.What was achieved on a temporary basis can become the norm.In order to avoid political bias in news and entertainment, a cross-BBC steering group should be established. Its aim would be to ensure impartiality across all BBC output and that content genuinely reflects the outlook of the country. Impartiality should not be just part of the mix but the number one priority and starting point for every item and running order.In order to provide evidence and benchmarks on which impartiality can be judged, the BBC Board, working with the BBC Editorial Policy and Standards department, should commission regular Ofsted-style reports into inidual programmes and how the BBC is handling a particular running story.The BBC can only be justified as a publicly funded broadcaster if it provides something its commercial rivals and newspapers do not - truly impartial news coverage.Over the past decade, the BBC has drifted away from its purpose and the people it serves. The arrival of Mr Davie offers a real chance to change course - BBC staff must not squander it.Sir Robbie Gibb is the former head of BBC Westminster and former director of communications at No 10 Downing StreetMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit britain should not creating new distant authorities back","story":"Should there be a bonfire of local government? A report, prepared for the County Councils Network, says that abolishing hundreds of district and county councils and consolidating them into 25 larger authorities would save billions of pounds and give communities a “united voice”. Strip out the layers of chief executives and councillors, many of them generously remunerated, and not only could more money be erted into services, but the inefficiencies, duplication – and even corruption – of the current set-up could be done away with.I am no fan of our present system of local government. From the broken City Hall experiment in London, with its imperial mayor and tendency to impose its inner city will on the outer tributaries of the capital, to the ineffective councils that either fail at the very basic duties assigned to them or indulge in wasteful spending that adds nothing to the lives of residents, the story of decentralised power in Britain is often one of incompetence and failure. You do not need to be unlucky enough to live in Tower Hamlets, as I do, where the former mayor was removed from office for electoral fraud, to have personal stories of each.It is no longer even true that councils are keeping the cost of local government down. While there is still significant local variation, invariably council tax is rising well above inflation, and that on top of crime commissioner precepts and social care levies. Council tax is one of the most unfair taxes of all, a charge that takes little account of income, and yet the assumption is that it must continue to go up regardless of economic conditions, or even of the quality of services provided in recompense.But should all of this necessitate a rationalisation of the patchwork quilt of local government? The problem is that, over recent months, we have also seen the terrible consequences of the mantra that bigger must always be better. This is, after all, the logic of the centralised quango state, particularly of the soon-to-be-defunct Public Health England. When these bodies fail, they fail spectacularly, impacting many more people. And does a voter really have more of a “voice” now that they have a mayor of the West Midlands, or wherever? Is democracy served when people are ruled by authorities that cross historic boundaries and accord to no identifiable local demos?The challenge for those of us who, instead, think power should be decentralised much more radically – to the lowest possible level, to discrete areas within boroughs, to towns and even villages – is that they would both need to be trusted to take greater responsibility for raising their own revenues and spending them wisely, and to coordinate with each other as required on issues that cross borders. We would also need to see more internal movement between areas, so bad authorities could be disciplined by residents fleeing, which means stamp duty must go. But other countries seem to manage it. It would be rather strange for Britain to leave the EU, only to create more distant authorities back here at home.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"china emerging winner vaccine race jabs reach phase three trials","story":"China is pulling ahead in what could be the final leg of the global coronavirus vaccine race, with four of seven possible candidates in last stage human trials – more than any other country. However, some are concerned about the quality of the vaccines and that they are being used to gain political leverage.Beijing is so confident in its homegrown inoculations that authorities have been administering vaccines for more than a month before clinical studies conclude, authorities revealed this week.People deemed to be at higher risk of infection, such as border officials and state-owned enterprise employees working overseas, have received jabs after the government approved them for emergency use, according to state media. Soon, transport and service workers are also expected to be vaccinated. “The reason why vaccines go through phase 3 trials is to reduce the short and long-term risk to the inidual,” he said. “Giving vaccine shots without this knowledge places iniduals at significant personal risk.” The Chinese government has provided sparse details on which vaccines are being given to people, and how many have been vaccinated, leading to concerns participation may be forced and not voluntary. Last week, Papua New Guinea cancelled a flight from China filled with arriving passengers believed to have received a coronavirus vaccine over worries of the unknown health impact to the local population. In general, “it’s better for a community if there’s more people vaccinated, so there’s less risk of an outbreak of Covid,” said Ben Cowling, ision head of epidemiology and biostatistics at Hong Kong University’s School of Public Health. “At the same time, just having some vaccinated people wouldn’t be enough to mean that social distancing could be relaxed.” Governments are under increasing pressure to find a lasting solution for the devastating pandemic that has swept the world, infecting nearly 25 million and killing more than 830,000. Authorities are also keen to get economies back on track as quarantine measures, though effective in containing the virus, are beginning to impact growth.“Covid is causing economic damage every week, every month, so the sooner we can start using vaccines, the better,” said Mr Cowling.For China, there are additional benefits. Coming up with a successful vaccine would help to deflect anger at home and abroad over its pandemic cover-up, while delivering a blow to US Donald Trump’s “warp-speed” plans for a vaccine. Competition is heating up as well with Russia.The Chinese government “sees science and technology as tools of national greatness,” said Yangyang Cheng, a scientist and postdoctoral fellow at Cornell University. Winning the vaccine race would underscore government propaganda about how “it’s really a hostile world out there, and we, as in the Chinese people, have to rely on ourselves”.It would also give China a new tool for diplomacy and potentially bring more allies into the fold. Indeed Beijing has already vowed “to give priority” to a number of Southeast Asian nations – the Philippines, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam – if it develops a vaccine. Canada, engaged in a longstanding diplomatic spat with Beijing, had to halt plans to partner in late stage clinical trials as vaccine doses, stalled in Chinese customs, never even arrived.Whether the world will trust a Chinese vaccine remains to be seen.China doesn’t have a great track record. Rushed exports of medical equipment and protective gear this year have turned out to be faulty. The country has also before been plagued with a number of health and food safety scandals, including expired vaccines and tainted baby formula that sickened 300,000 infants and killed at least six in 2008. If early inoculations in China end up failing, experts say that could impact global public confidence in the efficacy of coronavirus vaccines in general. While drug regulators have the power to decide whether or not to approve a Chinese vaccine for use in their own countries, they could come under pressure to fast-track a successful candidate on the market, regardless of who developed the treatment. Countries, though, that China has agreed to conduct advanced tests with include Brazil, Lebanon, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, Peru, Morocco, where regulatory hurdles for vaccines to become available may be less stringent than in Western countries like the US or UK.Still, experts are optimistic with so many vaccine candidates in advanced testing, which could eventually yield a few options. Over time, it may also emerge that some vaccines are better suited for certain parts of the population for instance, one type of vaccine could be more effective or suitable for children versus adults, said Mr Cowling.While results of phase three trials won’t be available for another few months, early orders for vaccines are already coming in as nations seek to secure access for their citizens.“The vaccine development process is like a marathon,” said Mr Cowling. “Some vaccines are nearing the end of the journey, but it’s unclear if they will finish. Some of these vaccines may not pan out hopefully they will.”While the coronavirus “does represent a significant threat to humanity,” infections can be controlled with social distancing and other preventative protocols, said Mr Thomas. “It is just that these have economic and political costs.”“The urgency narrative being put out by Chinese, Russian and American officials is more about national prestige and avoiding such costs than about the comprehensive testing of a new vaccine.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"teachers set defy government andblock pupils return classroom","story":"Hundreds of headteachers will defy Government orders and block their pupils’ return to the classroom, a union has warned.A survey by the National Association of Headteachers shows more than 700 schools, or 3 per cent of the total number, will phase students back or use \u0027transition periods\u0027 to reopen.The Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said all schools should be fully reopened from the start of September, following heavy disruption to the summer term amid the coronavirus pandemic.Many local authority areas are due to return to school on Tuesday.However, some headteachers still have concerns about fully reopening, despite guidance on student \u0027bubbles\u0027 and measures to promote frequent hand-washing in most schools.The NAHT said the schools postponing their reopening represented a “tiny percentage” and any delays were intended to “alleviate pupils’ anxieties about the return”.The survey came as research by TES magazine, a weekly UK publication aimed at education professionals, suggested that nine in 10 teachers have concerns about social distancing.A poll of nearly 6,000 school staff in England found that 86 per cent of respondents thought minimising contact between pupils would not be possible, while two thirds feared guidance to avoid busy corridors, entrances and exits is unrealistic.The survey, conducted by TES magazine, also found more than a quarter of staff may not comply with the Test and Trace programme should there be a coronavirus outbreak at their school.More than a third feel that the Government\u0027s approach to coronavirus safety in schools will not work and leaves them at risk, the poll showed.Teaching unions have already warned the Government that safety measures will not be enough to protect pupils and staff, and have pressurised ministers to introduce new rules on face coverings in schools in areas under local lockdown.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT, urged parents to send their children back to school despite the concerns.“Please do not let the very public political difficulties and arguments cloud your confidence in schools,” he said.“School leaders and their teams have continued to do all that has been asked of them.“With cooperation and understanding between home and school we can achieve the very best return possible despite the political noise”.His call echoed Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, who warned parents who keep their children at home they risk a huge dent in their future life chances.In an open letter to parents, he said the health risk posed to pupils was “extremely low”.If a child is not in school, they stand to lose far more than just a few months of learning. It could well put a huge dent in their future life chances, he said.Education is a birthright, so let\u0027s make sure we get all children back – back to learning, back to playing and back to being kids again.A Government spokesman argued parents were “increasingly confident in their children returning to school”.“Getting all children back into their classrooms full-time in September is a national priority because it is the best place for their education, development and wellbeing,” the spokesman said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uks horse whisperer helping animals riders equipilates","story":"It’s commonly thought that lame horses are destroyed because it\u0027s less cruel than forcing them through the necessary recovery period.In severe cases, such as severe fractures, that holds true, but if at all possible Lady Pollyanna FitzGerald prefers a unique form of treatment – horse pilates.And, while she certainly looks nothing like Robert Redford – more English counties than Hollywood cowboy – Pollyanna could be regarded as our very own horse whisperer able to bring traumatised horses back to health by working through a series of what she calls ‘soft tissue corrective exercises’ with the horse.Using a series of specially designed massages for horses she manipulates the animal’s soft tissue to help correct problems and imbalances a horse may be experiencing due to repetitive or strenuous activities and trauma.  The idea of this ‘body work’ is not only to reduce the occurrence of injury and aid recovery from injury and strenuous activities, but also to promote the horse’s well being and relaxation – which is why some have mistakenly described it as ‘horse yoga’.“I do bodywork and stretches with horses,” Lady Pollyanna told The .“I don’t do yoga for humans or horses. I suppose what I do for horses would be akin to human Pilates.”She added: “There are some injuries that horses can not recover from due to their physiology such as a severe break to a leg, hence why they often are put down straight away as this is more humane to the animal.Lady Pollyanna added: “There are so many reasons for lameness. Some are just as simple as a tight, or pulled, muscle that can be easily fixed. I also do a lot of maintenance so that horses are less likely to get injuries from the work they do.”But her work doesn’t stop at the horse. Lady Pollyanna, who, as it happens, is a practitioner of Halo Yoga, as well as Goju Ryu karate, also extends her philosophy to the rider. #Lady Pollyanna, 38, the daughter of the Duke of Leinster, runs her Lightspeed Sports Recovery practice from a stables in Oxford, where she describes the idea behind her work as that of “creating a deeper partnership between rider and horse that works better as a whole”.What she calls EquiPilates is “a wonderful way for the rider to work on imbalances, core strength and understanding their body and how they can influence their horse,” she said, adding: “One is dependant on the other, so when possible it is good to see the horse being ridden and how they interact together to allow me, the practitioner, a deeper understanding on how I can improve them as a unit.”The former Millfield School pupil, who also finds time for a bit of ice hockey, mountain biking and weight lifting, begins by looking at the animal’s movement without a rider.  This is done by watching the horse move in circles and straight lines in all three gaits walking, trotting and cantering, allowing Lady Pollyanna to observe the horse’s “movement biomechanics” and identify any areas that might need some work, such as lameness.She added: “I also talk to the rider about how the horse feels to ride. For example do they feel stiff going one direction, but not the other.”The horse is then examined and its joint movements checked to identify tight muscles and sore areas. There follows a course of massage, or soft tissue work, followed by acupressure, stretching, core exercises and strengthening exercises.“The owner is then taught some of the key exercises to continue between treatments. In short I act like a personal trainer to the horse and direct the owner to continue the process to get the most gains,” she says.The same method is then used on the rider to assess their movement, followed by soft tissue work and a series of exercises.“Once horse and rider are both physically more functional and comfortable I will work with the horse and rider together,” says Lady Pollyanna.“Often the focus is on the rider and getting an improved posture to allow the horse to move better. I am not there to teach an inidual to ride, that is down to their instructor, but to use their body in a more functional and balanced way that then allows the horse more freedom of movement.”Prices range from £40, up to £70 an hourMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"working parents have had enough","story":"The advent of a new school year is always a significant milestone in the lives of children and their families. This year it carries more significance than most, marking as it does a return to school for pupils deprived, for near-on half a school year, of the chance to learn, to be socially and intellectually stimulated, and to work towards becoming the adults of our next generation.Experts have written at length about the detrimental effect of lockdown on children’s mental health and future prospects. Research published by the Royal Society predicts a 3 per cent loss in future annual earnings for affected pupils: a scar across their entire working lives. Likewise, the working parents of school-aged children have been struggling with increasing desperation since March.Zero or very limited schooling since then, and an almost complete cancellation of summer holiday clubs have left many hamstrung. A significant but growing minority – predominantly women – have been forced to take reduced pay or, in some cases, to become an unemployment statistic.Leave aside, for now, that for many, school will feel quite different to the version last seen in March, and let’s close our eyes, momentarily, to the concerns aired by many parents about a school regime that includes social distancing, face coverings and a restricted curriculum. Working parents could briefly rejoice that schools were definitely, unequivocally, going back, full time, from September.But then, at 9.30pm on Friday, the Government published its updated Guidance for Schools. All 25,000 words of it.Reading the new rules, I was gobsmacked. Most notably, they contained a \u0027two week on, two week off\u0027 rota system for schools in local lockdown areas. Both the timing and content of this document shows a callous disregard for just about everyone affected: school leaders, teachers, working parents and – most of all – children.Let’s be clear: rota learning will be a disaster for children already so cruelly subordinated during lockdown. The evidence is unequivocal: online lessons are no substitute for school. We know that one fifth of children did less than an hour a day of schoolwork at home during lockdown and 71 per cent of state school children received no, or less than one, daily online lesson.It is equally a disaster for working parents. The preamble to the guidance states that it “has been developed with input from school leaders, unions, sector bodies, PHE, and the HSE”. Not, then, those on whom the policy has the greatest impact: parents. The Government seems oblivious to the fact that for most working parents, school provides essential childcare as much as an education – we simply can’t do our jobs without it.It is savagely ironic that this comes in the week the Government is briefing that we might lose our jobs if we don’t get back to the office pronto. Is it really any surprise given how this Government has behaved on schools that the British have been the slowest in Europe to get back to the office?Continuity of schooling for this cohort of children should now be non-negotiable, but as the Government seems unable to guarantee this, and with no exit plan in sight, we must talk about the options for parents who reject this as the new normal.Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, says there must now be “increased childcare investment and strengthened rights to flexible working”. This is indeed urgent, but alone it is not sufficient. Parents must be paid back their taxes for weeks of schooling missed. Legislation must be introduced to make parenthood a legally protected characteristic. Working parents should not be at risk in the workplace because the state has failed to provide schooling.The Better Regulation Framework, requiring government departments to consult with those affected by policy decisions that affect businesses, must be extended, so that changes like this can never again be waived through without a full and proper discussion.Working parents are the backbone of this country and children are its future. We must decide whether or not we want a society that supports families in a meaningful and sustainable way.

My partner is in the supermarket and he sounds fed up. “What,” he says, “is a gremlin? And what sort of wafers did you mean?”No idea, I say. Why? “Because you put them on the shopping list.”Later, unpacking the shopping, I see he has forgotten to buy gherkins and water. He points at the list, and there they are in my spidery scrawl – gremlin, wafer. How was he supposed to know what they meant? It’s a shopping list, not the Rosetta Stone.It’s not just him who finds my handwriting illegible. I often find myself peering, flummoxed, at my own hieroglyphics. The publisher Jock Murray once wrote to author Iris Origo that the only way he could decipher her famously crabbed script was to place her letter on a table, down a stiff whisky, then fall to his hands and knees and scrutinise the offending missive at eye level.This isn’t (alas) an option in Sainsbury’s, but Amazon has recently patented a techie solution to shopping list tetchiness. It involves augmented-reality glasses that make your shopping list appear on your arm, like a tattoo.The patent doesn’t mean that we’ll be shuffling along the aisles any time soon, steering our trolleys with one hand while trying to read “haddock, potatoes, Mr Muscle” emblazoned on our forearm. But if Amazon’s invention becomes a reality, I foresee a couple of issues.Sleeve tattoos, for a start. Will David Beckham and his inked brethren be able to dodge the supermarket run in perpetuity?Then there’s the loss of the physical shopping list as a cultural artefact. My scrawled list is an ephemeral text, discarded as soon as we have passed the checkout. But go back a few centuries and those ephemeral texts offer invaluable insights into the lives of past generations.Who can resist the fascination of the provisions list for the Roman garrison at Vindolanda fort south of Hadrian’s Wall (20 chickens, 100 apples, a modius of olives)? How strangely familiar is Michelangelo’s shopping list of fennel, anchovies and full-bodied wine (each item with its own tiny, exquisite illustration, lest his servant struggle to read his writing)?And while Jock Murray may have grappled with Iris Origo’s writing, her book The Merchant of Prato was a painstaking exploration of the handwritten domestic records of the 14th-century Tuscan merchant, Francesco di Marco Datini, whose business partner sweetly bought a tambourine for “two lire, 10 soldi, so the little girls may be happy”.On his website, grocerylists.org, the American journalist Bill Keaggy chronicles discarded shopping lists collected in his home town of St Louis. “One of life’s most banal duties, viewed through the curatorial lens, can somehow seem pregnant with possibility,” he observes of these poignant, overlooked, and occasionally alarming (“knife, cooler, map, cellphone, hunting license, say goodbye to wife, kill deer”) lists.If Amazon’s patent goes into production, our shopping lists will no longer be private ephemera. Instead, they will be algorithmed into inidually curated adverts for gherkins and kitchen roll. Which is good news for those of us with terrible handwriting, but sad for historians, archivists, and foragers of the resonant stories hidden within the scribbled chronicles of our everyday excursions to hunt-gather soya milk, leeks and loo cleaner.     More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000604979324.jpg?w=960","title":"coronavirus uk live latest news eat out to help out","story":"The Eat Out to Help Out scheme is due to end today.But some chains have chosen to continue to offer % off deals at their own cost.And thousands of Brits have also been reported to police for breaking the -day quarantine rule.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said yesterday that , people have been referred to police after ing from a number of destinations abroad and not quarantining.

I cannot remember any government being so devoid of direction, leadership, policy, conviction and — frankly — intelligence.And I had to endure Ted Heath AND John Major’s attempts to run the country. Oh, and the shaft of glorious sunshine that was Gordon Brown. Those guys have nothing on Boris. He is the clear leader in the field. If you ever wanted to know what a country would look likeit was led by Frank Spencer, here you go. Yes, I know — I’m showing my age. To be honest, under this administration I’m feeling my age.For those who don’t remember, Frank was a bumbling, dithering, halfwit from the s sitcom Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em. The only dference with Bojo is that Frank was thinner. And, mercully, a fictional creation. Boris is all too real. Many kids will be going back to school wearing face masks. For ages, this government insisted that they would not have to do so. Now they’ve changed their minds. Face masks and grouped in “bubbles”. Probably getting only about half of their usual education,that. Any kid who coughs will be pounced upon, exiled to the Outer Hebrides and the entire school shuts down. Never mind that there has been no recorded case of a schoolkid passing on the virus to a teacher.Never mind that our economy needs the schools fully open with a proper, normal, timetable, so people can get back to work.After six months of no lessons , the kids now have to endure insufferable conditions at school.This is because Boris and the rest have proved utterly incapable of standing up to the teaching unions .Other U-turns have involved the wearing of masks in shops, the usefulness of masks in general, whether there’s any point in closing our borders, the schools due to re-open in June, the scrapping of an expensive track and trace system, the re-grading of GCSEs and A levels . . . oh lordy, the list goes on and on.Sometimes the U-turn appears only a day after the original decision.Sometimes we have to wait a week or so. But come they surely do, a long parade of staggering ineptitude. In fact, I think even Frank Spencer would have been more decisive. Maybe the right comparison is with Benny from Crossroads. Yes, it’s my age again. For those who don’t know, Benny was a cast-iron moron.We know that dealing with this horrible pandemic can’t have been easy. We know Boris has had a dficult year.But the utter lack of planning and resolve has been astonishing. Slow to take the virus seriously, bizarrely refusing to close our airports at the peak of the outbreak, hopelessly lost over track and trace and what do with our poor kids.This has been mismanagement on an almost heroic level. My guess is that Boris will not survive as Prime Minister: His party will get shot of him when the opportunity arises. Because here’s the crucial, damaging question.Could Jeremy Corbyn have handled this crisis any worse I DON’T think those smug monkeys at the BBC realised the fury they would unleash when they banned singing our favourite anthems at The Last Night Of The Proms.A petition reached , names in just  hours.And Dame Vera Lynn is suddenly at No in the iTunes chart with Land Of Hope And Glory.The BBC apparently agreed with the Finnish conductor, Dalia Stasevska, that the “jingoistic” words of Land Of Hope And Glory and Rule Britannia would not be heard this year.I wonder what convinced Ms Stasevska to agree to conduct an evening of patriotic songs when she hates patriotic songs Money, you would guess. Meanwhile another BBC bureaucrat, Cat Lewis, likened singing the songs to Nazis singing about gas chambers.Silly woman. The BBC – its entire staff – has no understanding of the British people. It despises them. Support for the corporation is at an all-time low. And yet the BBC is still up to its tricks. Pulling off the unusual feat of being already in a coffin, but reaching out somehow to hammer more nails into its own lid.A TEAM of British scientists has been studying dreams and what they mean.And they’ve discovered they mean sod all. They are just a continuation of memories from the previous day.Other recent studies showed the same thing. So,you dream you’re flying around your house with some bats, it means you were probably thinking about bats when you were awake.It doesn’t mean you’re neurotic or sexually repressed. So – that’s all the work of Sigmund Freud in the bin. It can go in a black bin liner along with the idiocies put forward by that other drongo of the th Century, Karl Marx. But given that we know all this, why are there still psychoanalysts plying their trade  Is it just to give Britain’s couch-makers plenty of work ANOTHER stupid, virtue-signalling British firm has run into trouble.Avanti West Coast made a big fuss about its new “pride train”, which runs from London to Manchester.The engine is painted in the colours of the LGBT rainbow flag.And it has the word “Pride” written in big letters – just in case anyone doesn’t get the message. There have been thousands of angry comments on social media.My favourite was from John James McGivern: “As a gay man, I don’t want a ‘pride train’, I just want to get on a train that runs on time like everyone .” Quite. Well said.Every time companies pull a stunt like this, the nation cringes.I don’t want a bloody voucher. You cancel the train I’m booked on, then refund the ticket.So I complain to them and they say nothing we can do.So I complain some more and tell them they’re acting illegally.Bingo – money back! I know a lot of people have had similar problems with airlines cancelling their flights and offering “vouchers”.It pays to pester these buggers. Pester and pester until they give in.POOR old slabhead, then. Manchester United’s Harry Maguire found himself uttering the most stupid words in the English language.“Do you know who I am ” And then explained to the Greek police officers who had arrested him that he was “very rich”. Then he tried to bribe them.⚠️Click here for the latest news on Harry MaguireGod help us all.I have always admired Maguire’s heading ability.It now seems to me that he gets so much force behind each header because he has reinforced concrete between his ears. Footballers are not renowned for being terribly bright.But Maguire has lowered the bar still further.One of the problems is the one to which the footballer alluded. He has too much money. So much that he doesn’t know what to do with it.And as a result is completely insulated from the real world. And when he does venture out into the real world it is to be continually abused by halfwits who do not like the club he plays for.Say sorry to the Greeks, Harry. And then shut up and play football.Andlouts give you abuse in the street, just smile at them.CHILDREN from working families were much better behaved during lockdown, according to a study from three British universities.I know that will come as news to some of you.A lot of kids seemed to be climbing the walls out of sheer boredom. But the researchers found that the kids had fewer tantrums.

As a result, very few people watch it — but it’s the toast of Beeb journos and left-wing social media, giving it undeserved influence over our daily news agenda.Despite her dressing-down over that outrageous Dominic Cummings monologue, Emily Maitlis is considered untouchable by executives. No one dares warn her that constant unbalanced questioning of Tory politicians and right-wing commentators is putting the very future of the Beeb under threat.And then there’s Lewis Goodall, the left-wing operative turned Newsnight policy editor who last week was allowed to author a feature for the New Statesman magazine headlined: “Failed. How the Government’s ineptitude created a lost generation.”As Theresa May’s former communications chief Sir Robbie Gibb put it: “Is there anyone more damaging to the BBC’s reputation for impartiality than Lewis Goodall ”I’ve read the thinly veiled left-wing think piece so you don’t have to.Goodall’s main thesis is to try to link the Covid-created A-level exams situation to the Windrush scandal.If it had been written by Owen Jones in the , I’d understand.But a full-time BBC staff member who we are consistently told is an impartial journalist, with no bias against the Government  Puh-lease! We cannot suspend our disbelief any longer.One thing Newsnight does best is sanctimony.We saw it again this week as the show’s editor, Esme Wren, planned to host a navel-gazing session at the Edinburgh TV Festival called Reporting Racism: TV Journalism And Black Lives Matter.Only problem is that Newsnight, for all its left-wing posturing, is the most middle-class, white news broadcast on the box.In fact, an investigation by the Mail on Sunday revealed the programme has NO non-white presenters and has been nicknamed NewsWhite behind the scenes.So a bunch of privately educated, rich, privileged members of the London liberal media elite — the very definition of champagne socialists — are on a nightly basis doing untold harm to the reputation of the BBC.But it’s too late now, the damage is done.The BBC hates everything we love about Britain.They are repelled by patriotism. They cannot stand anyone who dares not vote Labour or Lib Dem. They will never forgive Brexit voters for destroying their European fantasy.And they fetishise Nicola Sturgeon’s unrealistic idea of Scottish independence.But this week, as Dame Vera Lynn’s version of Land Of Hope And Glory hurtled towards the top of the iTunes chart, the fight back began.SINCERE condolences to Sir Ed Davey on winning the Liberal Democrat leadership yesterday.My thoughts are with you at this dficult time.SARAH Harding is the fighter of the entertainment industry.Vulnerable to a fault, during her time in Girls Aloud she shared her many trials and tribulations with that trademark throaty laugh and a glint in her eye.Unlike so many pop stars, there was never a hint of ego. In fact, Sarah is her own harshest critic.To discover that over the past few months she has privately been fighting the biggest battle of her le – breast cancer that has spread across her body – was truly a punch- in-the-guts moment for my generation, who idolised Sarah, Cheryl, Nadine, Kimberley and Nicola.I pray that she overcomes the odds, as she always has in her ied and accomplished career.And then reunites with Girls Aloud, as planned, for the band’s th anniversary in .THE great irony about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s newly revealed courtship with Jeremy Corbyn is that he’d love to see the monarchy abolished and Harry’s gran see out her days living in a council house.But so craven are Harry and Meghan for left-wing approval, they appeared to relish the post-Megxit support from the former Labour leader.New book Left Out: The Inside Story Of Labour Under Corbyn reveals that at the Commonwealth Day Service in March, where Prince William infamously snubbed the couple, Corbyn’s we Laura Alez, gave them a book about the th Century Mexican poet Juana Ines de la Cruz, “a nun whose willingness to attack the hypocrisies of the colonial classes had made her a target for establishment hate”. Harry and Meghan later sent a personal note of “great thanks” to Jeremy and Laura, writing: “Cruz is a fascinating historical figure, and we look forward to learning more about her le and works. Thanks for the support.”That revelation came one day after Meghan made her first intervention into this year’s US election, with a not-at-all-subtle anti-Trump message to American voters, suggesting: “We all know what’s at stake this year”.I have long been told by those close to her that Meghan harbours political ambitions and would one day like to end up in elected office.Which is absolutely fine.But to continue to use the Duchess title and represent the Queen on the Commonwealth Trust is highly inappropriate.I’d have great respectshe would cut the cords entirely and become a political activistwithout causing a massive diplomatic headache for the Royal Family.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nilsen, who died behind bars in , murdered at least  young men in North London, dressing his victims before dissecting them.The letters, written by Nilsen after he was given a le term in  for murder and attempted murder, were kept by DCI Jay’s son Simon after the policeman died of cancer in February .A few months after the detective’s death, producers spoke to his family.Simon handed over the correspondence, along with hundreds of notes, crime scene sketches and interview transcripts kept in a dusty briefcase for decades, so the programme makers could ensure their TV drama told the true story.In an exclusive interview Simon, , of Tewin, Herts, said: “I had no idea of the existence of the briefcase, but mum revealed that he had kept key notes from the case.“When I opened it I found the letters from Nilsen to dad. It gave me chills to know that the hand who wrote this had slaughtered so many men so horrically.“I was proud to see what dad did in this landmark case. I think while Nilsen was convicted of six of the murders, it was a reminder of the families for whom he hadn’t achieved justice. Dad never forgot them or the fact that not all the bodies were identied.”Simon appears as a police officer in the three-part series, which stars Line Of Duty’s Daniel Mays, , as his father and former Doctor Who star David Tennant, , as the killer. Daniel revealed David met Simon and his mum Linda, , as part of his research. And he even managed to copy Nilsen’s signature.Daniel said: “David delivers an utterly spellbinding turn. It was eerie. He physically resembled him.”Filmed before lockdown and starting next month, the drama tells how Nilsen plied his victims with alcohol before killing them, often using strangulation.He dismembered them, boiled some of their brains and stored them in bin bags.The jobcentre worker then tried to flush remains down the toilet. A Dyno-Rod plumber discovered the horror when he went to Nilsen’s home in Muswell Hill, North London to unblock the drains. When Nilsen opened the door to DCI Jay and Det Insp Steve McCusker, who had come to arrest him, the cops were hit with the stench of death.The detective told Nilsen: “Don’t mess me about. Where’s the rest of the body ” Nilsen responded: “It’s over there in the wardrobe.”When they brought him to the police car, McCusker said: “Are we talking one body or two ” Nilsen replied: “I think it’s more like .”In the aftermath of his arrest, Nilsen wrote to DCI Jay from HMP Brixton in South London.Dated October , he said in the letter with thinly-veiled fury: “Thanks for all your efforts to arrive at the truth of this case.”He told the detective their “first meeting” was “duller” than the account in the DCI’s statement.Nilsen said it was “An understandable slip of memory.”He added: “‘What have you done with the body’ looks like it came straight out ofAn Inspector Calls or something in the Agatha Christie vein” and signed off “Cheers, Dennis Nilsen”.Simon, whose father left the force two years after Nilsen was jailed in November  said: “Dad was always pinpoint accurate.“Nilsen’s motives for writing these letters are obvious. He wanted to regain control.“His fury at being caught and exposed as the evil monster he was is there in black and white.”The letters show that DCI Jay wanted to conduct further interviews with Nilsen prior to his conviction.Simon — dad to two-year-old Noah with partner Louise,  — also revealed that his father saved his le when he twice attempted suicide due to depression at university.He said: “Dad dropped everything to be there when I needed him.

Almost seven in ten of people use this type of mask.Yet just a third of this group - or just  percent - are following correct procedure and washing their mask after every use.And even among these people, only  percent are washing them at  degrees or higher – lower temperatures are not enough to kill viruses like Covid-.Worryingly, one in seven of washable, reusable mask wearers have never washed their coverings - meaning they are less effective at halting the spread of the virus.According to UK Government advice, face masks should be washed regularly. The Government says: It can go in with other laundry, using your normal detergent.Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation  advises people to wash their masks in soap or detergent “at least once a day”.If you bought your mask from a shop its wise to check the washing instructions your mask came with. However, people should aim to wash them at  degrees Celsius and use detergent to kill the virus.You should then dry your cloth mask by putting it in the tumble dryer and then using an iron.Store the face cover in a clean, plastic, resealable bag so it’s fresh and ready for when you next need it.Around three in tenof mask wearers use single use disposable face masks. But the results show that most of this group haven’t grasped the “single use” aspect of these masks - with over halfwearing disposable coverings more than once. A further  percent have never thrown one away after wearing it - meaning the covering is harbouring bacteria.Before putting your face mask on, wash your hands or use hand sanitiser and repeat after taking it off.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose.Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched.Just  percent are throwing their single use disposable face masks in the bin after one wear. Meanwhile, only  percent of men are likely to throw the disposable masks away, compared to  percent of female users.Experts say the higher the temperature you wash your mask, the more likely you are to kill of any signs of Covid-.Laundryheap CEO Deyan Dimitrov says: Our core body temperature runs at an average of C, and provides the ideal conditions for bacteria and viruses to thrive.This meansyou’re looking to fight off the dreaded coronavirus, the much revered C wash might not always pack the punch needed.“Most viruses won’t survive in temperatures over C, so you could opt for this setting.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson warned parents that children risked a huge dent in their future le chancesthey did notto the classroom. In a letter to parents, he said: If a child is not in school, they stand to lose far more than just a few months of learning. It could well put a huge dent in their future le chances. Education is a birthright, so letaposs make sure we get all children back - back to learning, back to playing and back to being kids again. But teaching unions reacted with fury when the Government published last-minute guidance for schools in lockdown areas - only days before pupils were due to go back for the new term. Here are some of the changes in store for schools in England. How will classrooms look dferent  Desks will be arranged to face forward to prevent the spread of infection, rather than allowing children to sit facing each other at tables. Windows and doors should be left open where possible to allow air to circulate. There will be increased handwashing facilities and hand sanitiser available - with teachers told to supervise younger children when using sanitiser. Social distancing to two metres should be followed whenever it is possible.  Children can bring their school bags with them but they should only have essential items such as books, lunch boxes and phones. Teachers are told to avoid sharing equipment such as books and games between dferent groups - and rigorous cleaning measures should be in place. What about communal areas  Ministers ditched advice for bubbles of  pupils but classes or year groups should kept apart to prevent the spread of infection. Many schools will have one-way systems in corridors, with staggered starts for lessons and for break times. Masks can be worn in corridors and communal areas in secondary schoolsheadteachers wish but it is not mandatory. Children should not wear masks in classrooms.  To prevent mixing between dferent groups, lunch could also be staggered, with some schools separating year groups and classes. Will the curriculum be the same  Schools have some freedom to help children catch up but the curriculum must remain broad and ambitious. The Government allows for substantial modication to the syllabus at the start of the year, with pupils allowed to drop some subjects in exceptional circumstances. But schools should aim to be back to their normal curriculum by next summer.  There will be a ban on assemblies, collective worship and choirs - as there is an increased risk of infection from singing and shouting. Music lessons should be restricted to groups of less than . PE lessons can continue although outdoor sports should be the priority. All equipment must be regularly cleaned. Will children need to wear masks  Secondary school pupils and staff can be told to wear face coverings in hallways and communal parts. This becomes mandatorythe area is in local lockdown. However masks are not advised in classrooms in any circumstances. What happensthe school is in a lockdown area  Under new rules, secondary schools pupils will be required to wears masks in communal areas in the first instance. Heads must draw up plans for two week rota system for dferent groups, so pupils can spend a fortnight at home to seesymptoms emerge. Week-on week-off rotas are also an option to keep children from mixing. In the most extreme circumstances, all children will be sent home to study remotely again - with only the most vulnerable or children of key workers staying in school.  Whatthere is an outbreak at the school  Schools will have to declare an outbreakthey have more than two  coronavirus  cases in two weeks or there has been a surge in pupils taking sick days where they might have coronavirus. Heads can summon mobile testing unitsthey are worried about cases and schools have been given a small number of home testing kits to give to parents who may struggle to get their children tested. However routine testing in schools is not advised. Children who have been in close contact with a student with Covid- will have to self isolate at home.

Rishi Sunak is said to be eyeing the UKaposs legal commitment to spend .% of GDP on projects in the worldaposs poorest nations - which amounts to about £bn a year. The Chancellor is planning to announce his intention to hive off foreign aid cash in the Budget in November to plug the coronavirus black hole, sources told The Sun.Treasury insiders claimed some money could be erted to fund Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence projects, as well as investing in the charities sector. The change would require the backing of MPs through primary legislation - but could face a rebellion, as angry MPs said it showed callous Tories were turning a blind eye to the fate of the worldaposs poorest. It comes as the Department for International Development- which looks after foreign aid - was due to be merged into the Foreign and Commonwealth Officethis week. Ex-Tory International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell told the Mirror: With the ink hardly dry on our manesto, I don’t think the House of Commons would easily agree to balance the books on the backs of the poorest women and children in the world. Labouraposs Sarah Champion, chair of the Commons International Development Committee, tweeted: Evidence this Tory Government wanted to take money from the very poorest in the world.Don’t be fooled this money will come to the UKs poor, it never does.So much for PMs promise not to touch .% Aid spend.

He wrote: “Schools have done what they can. If the R rate increases, it would be entirely wrong to lay any blame for that at the door of school leaders.” And embattled Education Secretary Gavin Williamson came under further pressure after his department published critical guidance for reopening schools at midnight on Friday.

It came after Education Committee chair Robert Halfon urged exam regulator Ofqual to make a decision on whether to hold exams in  within weeks. It is : that exams go ahead next summer,” he said. Schools, the Department for Education and Ofsted need to work out how much disruption there will be to pupilsapos learning in the coming year. “Serious analysis needs to be done, and then they need to make an announcement about exams within the next few weeks. Ms Green said: “Pupils across the country who have missed out on vital teaching time will have a mountain to climb to prepare for May exams unless the government steps in. ”Ministers had warning after warning about problems with this year’s exam results, but allowed it to descend into a fiasco.“This is too important for Boris Johnson to leave until to the last minute.

Revellers took to the streets in cities across the country on Sunday night to enjoy the long weekend despite the chilly weather and coronavirus restrictions. As pub-goers spilled out in Leeds, where it would have been Leeds Festival this weekend, one man was seen covered in blood with an apparent injury to his face as he was helped by his friends. A number of people were looking worse for wear after a night out in the city centre, with photos showing revellers hunched over on benches, steps or on the pavement as they are comforted by their pals. There were similar scenes in Newcastle city centre as partygoers enjoyed a night out. Despite the chilly weather and nightclubs being shut, women were out in their party attire. Police and health officials had urged Britons to comply with social distancing rules and take it easy during the long weekend, fearing the virus could spread at large gatherings.There were also fears that many illegal raves could take place to fill the void. Current coronavirus restrictions mean nightclubs and dance floors are not allowed. Under the existing rules in England, people should stay two metres apart. If thataposs not possible, the one-metre plus rule applies with extra precautions such as face coverings and not sitting face-to-face. Six people from multiple households or up to  people from two households can meet outdoors in England. This yearaposs chilly weather comes a year after Britons basked in an August Bank Holiday heatwave.The Bank Holiday Monday in  was the hottest on record with .C recorded at Heathrow Airport. The August Bank Holiday is the English bank holiday before Christmas. A number of big events are usually held this weekend, but they have been cancelled due to the threat of Covid-.  They include Reading and Leeds Festival, and Notting Hill Carnival in west London. Low temperatures will end a month of extreme weather in the UK, which has included two named storms, a heatwave, and the hottest August day recorded in  years. The Met Office said that although the bank holiday has been unseasonably cool, the low temperatures are not expected to break any records. Alex Burkill, meteorologist at the Met Office, said that the iety of hot, cold and windy weather would likely not be reflected in the monthly averages.  He said: Weaposve not broken any records with how cold itaposs got. Daytime temperaturesdid struggle, but the lowest maximum temperature was .C and the record is .C, so weaposre quite far off that. Monday daytime temperatures will struggle again, probably only just about getting into double figures in some places, but iaposd be surprisedwe broke any records. It has been quite extreme at times, weaposve had some very hot weather and then the two storms towards the end of the month, he said. Even this bank holiday has been unseasonably cool, itaposs not that often that we get temperatures around freezing in August.has brought everything this month and thataposs not really going to be captured in the monthly averages.

Even though the weather has been chilly and windy during the night, groups of friends took to the street to celebrate the long weekend.Two girls were spotted wearing face masks with their party dresses, but many others did not wear one. Revellers were drinking in the street - with some having too many drinks to the point that they vomited in the street. Party-goers ready for a night out were also seen in Newcastle. In Leeds, some people joined a local busker, singing and dancing together.  Party-goers hit Birmingham’s city centre and queued up to get into some of the bars that have reopened since the coronavirus lockdown. One woman was wheeled into an ambulance after she was unable to walk home. Her friends reportedly took care of her before paramedics arrived. Revellers were also seen in central London, with a woman photographed as she lay on the pavement in Soho. Manchester also saw people going out and flouting coronavirus lockdown rules as party-goers were seen drinking and hugging across the city.  A man in Newcastle was seen with a face mask on his forehead as he smiled at his friends. Several police forces, including politan Police, urged people not to join unlicensed events which put communities at risk due to the Covid- pandemic. The force tweeted: Unlicensed music events are illegal, dangerous and often linked to anti-social behaviour and violence. People who attend unlicensed music events are putting themselves, their families and their communities at risk. Please think about others and stay at home. Tougher fines have been introduced ahead of the Bank Holiday targeting the most serious breaches of social distancing restrictions.  The new regulations, which came into force on August , aim to prevent further spread of the virus. Those facilitating or organising illegal raves, unlicensed music events, or any other unlawful gathering of more than  people may face a £, fine. Fines of £ can continue to be issued to those who participate in illegal gatherings. Those who have already received a fine will see the amount of doubled on each offence, up to a maximum of £,. Home Secretary Priti Patel said: These gatherings are dangerous and those who organise them show a blatant disregard for the safety of others. I am pleased the police have already stepped up their response and I am giving them the tools they need to continue to keep us safe. We will continue to crack down on the small minority who think they are above the law.  In areas of concern – such as Leicester and Greater Manchester - deployments have already been larger than on New Year’s Eve. National Police Chiefs’ Council Lead for Unlicensed Music Events, Commander Ade Adelekan, said: We welcome this further deterrent against those who irresponsibly put people’s health and safety at risk by organising these events. Unlicensed music events are unlawful and unregulated. These events are hosted without regard for the safety of those attending, and police have observed cases of anti-social behaviour, sales of drugs and gang activity.

Debbie Barton, , is at her witsapos end after unfinished repairs left her with an incomplete kitchen plagued with rats and flies and electrical sockets hanging off the walls. She said her repeated requests to fix the kitchen have been ignored by Dane Plus housing association which it strongly denies.The mum-of-two, from Bootle, Merseyside,has even resorted to making her own temporary repairs to the kitchen she claims is unsafe for her children. When rats started to invade her house, Debbie was forced to do her own emergency repair works on a pipe. Gaps left around her windows meant she was plagued by flies this summer and she is having to store food in the living room.Debbie said: “They came and redone the damp and said my kitchen would be finished the following week but four weeks later l still have no kitchen. l have to store food in my living room. l canapost let my kids in the kitchen because itaposs unsafe. l canapost even use the worktops to prepare food.” After winning compensation from the housing association for previous incomplete repairs, Debbie said she is now at her witsapos end.

The mum said she was awarded compensation but accepted a lower so that the necessary repair work could start quickly. Early this year, damp in her kitchen was causing problems so she contacted Plus Dane again for repairs. But when the pandemic started, the vital work stopped and she was left with kitchen worktops not properly connected and electrical sockets hanging off the walls. The housing association admitted delays due to lockdown and customer shielding but denied Debbieaposs kitchen was left unsafe.A Plus Dane Housing spokesperson said: “We have been in regular contact with this customer in a bid to address the necessary repairs and improvements to her kitchen. “There have naturally been some delays to our schedule because of lockdown and the fact the customer was shielding, but the tenant has always been able to contact members of the team directly with any concerns.

Mum-of-four Cat Ward, , and fiance Tim Williams, , were all set to marry last Wednesday but postponed tying the knot for a year with heavy restrictions in place on events. But tragedy struck earlier this month when dad Ron Ward, , was diagnosed with leukaemia and given just six to  months, evenhe responds to treatment.To give her dad the best possible chance of walking her down the aisle, Cat has managed to rearrange the wedding to January  at St Michaelaposs Church, Stone, reports StokeonTrentLive. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  But with furloughed HGV driver Tim having now been made redundant by Eddie Stobart in a real kick in the teeth, the couple are struggling to meet the new costs.As a result, their families have launched a GoFundMe page to help them afford their dream day, which will also include a reception at the Upper House, in Barlaston.Cat, from Barlaston, North Staffs, said: Originally we were happy for our wedding to be pushed back a year because we have a big family and wanted everyone there.  We could never have imagined that my dad would be so ill. The earliest date that both venues have free is January  so weaposre just hoping that dad responds to treatment. He has six, maybe  months at most. It would mean everything to have my dad walk me down the aisle and it means the world to him. I think itaposs every little girlaposs dream. Iaposm such a daddyaposs girl and we have always been very close. When he is no longer here it would mean a lotI can have that memory of him being there on the biggest day of my le.  Ron, who lives in Fair Oak, near Eccleshall, with we Joy, already suffered from a heart condition and dementia, but his health further deteriorated during lockdown. His daughter said heaposs usually so fit and is often pottering around the garden but put off seeing his doctor due to the pandemic. He got an appointment and he was rushed off for tests, his daughter said. It was still such a shock to be told he had leukaemia. Weaposve been told it will be a matter of weekshe doesnapost respond to the chemotherapy. What makes it harder is that Iaposve barely seen my parents through lockdown and weaposd just started seeing him again, she added.Cat and Tim met  years ago on Facebook and now have four daughters - Poppy, four, Daisy, three, Holly, two and Rosie, one.Cat admitted she nearly gave up when Tim - a student at Staffordshire University at the time - failed to show up on time for their first date but he rang her and begged me to stay. After moving in together they began to try for a family but three miscarriages in five years left them fearing it wasnapost meant to be before they had four daughters in quick succession. After Daisy was born, Tim told Cat he was going to the shop with Poppy and when he came back, he askedshe could change her because she had spaghetti down her top. I pulled up her top and thataposs when underneath I saw she was wearing a vest saying aposMummy, will you marry my Daddy apos. It was just lovely, Cat remembered. The GoFundMe page has a target of £, with any extra donations going to Macmillan Cancer Support and the Royal Stoke University Hospitalaposs cancer centre.

TV cameras are following them around, as proud grandparents Noel and Sue Radford, who have had  children of their own, and their family are currently filming a new four-part docuseries that is due to air next year. In the latest video update on YouTube, viewers are given a look at Millieaposs bedroom, which is filled with baby items including a cot and a pram that needs to be put together, as she makes her final preparations for labour. She could welcome her first child very soon. Sat on her bed, her mum Sue tells her: Oh my word, Millie, she might even be here, like, by this time next week. Millie jokes: We need to be going over some speed bumps, thataposs what we need to be doing.Her mum responds: We do. I tell you what weaposre going to do.

Millie and her mum then go through the clothes she is taking with her to the hospital, including comfortable pyjamas, slippers and a gown.

At one point, Sue holds up a pair of Millieaposs knickers and calls them big pants, adding: Youaposll be able to tuck your big mum belly in that, it will be really flabby.

The two boys had an incredibly close relationship with their mother, who was determined their upbringing would be filled with as much love and fun as possible. The trio loved to play pranks on each other and enjoyed normal Saturday evenings of watching TV and eating fast food, just like any other family in Britain. And Diana was determined to two sons would develop her passion for good causes and wanted them to champion charities from a young age. In a moving interview with Martin Bashir she stressed she wanted them to have an understanding of peopleaposs emotions, peopleaposs insecurities, peopleaposs distress, and peopleaposs hopes and dreams. Ever since they made the move into public le, both William and Harryaposs easy way of dealing with the public has evoked memories of their beloved mum, along with their drive to do good. Diana also made sure they were aware how fortunate they were from an early age. She said: I take them round homelessness projects, Iaposve taken William and Harry to people dying of Aids - albeit I told them it was cancer - Iaposve taken the children to all sorts of areas where Iaposm not sure anyone of that age in this family has been before. And they have a knowledge - they may never use it, but the seed is there, and I hope it will grow because knowledge is power. But when William was just  and his younger brother, Harry, was just , their world fell apart when their beloved mum was killed in a car accident in Paris on August , .  Her sons were on holiday with their father, Prince Charles, at Balmoral when the call came through about the tragedy. Charles was the first person to be told, in a phone call, about his ex-weaposs death. Stunned, he informed the Queen, and the two of them tried to come up with a way of shielding the two young princes from the worst of the tragedy. But Harry was determined to fulfil one final wish for his beloved mother - he wanted to travel to Paris with his father to collect her body. Charles, desperate to protect his young son, refused the request, and instead travelled alone to bring Dianaaposs body back to Britain. Journalist and friend of Diana, Richard Kay said: The Queen and Prince Charlesapos view was that the boys were their main priority. However, Charlesapos decision to travel with Dianaaposs body himself caused a huge rt with his mother, the Queen. Richard said: Charles took the decision that he was going to Paris to bring back Dianaaposs body. This was a surprising and brave move. He was an ex-husband, he had no right to be there other than as the father of her sons. Charles wanted to take the royal flight to Paris but the Queen wouldnapost allow it.  Charles fought harder for Diana than he had ever fought for her in her letime. The Prince of Wales refused to back down and eventually the Queen agreed to allow him to fly on the royal plane to bring his ex-weaposs body back to Britain. Following Dianaaposs death, Harry has admitted his struggled with grief. It inspired him to set up mental health initiatives to encourage other people to open up about their feelings. He has said he regrets not opening up sooner about the death of his mother.  In a powerful documentary  in  Harry said he refused to accept his mother was gone. He also praised Prince Charles for always being there for him following Dianaaposs death. Harry said about his initial reaction to being told, while at Balmoral, that his mother was dead: “Disbelief, refused to accept it. “There was no sort of sudden outpour of grief.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry shares new hobby","story":"NewsPrince Harry shares new hobby he has lined up for Archie and promises UK The Duke of Sussex has admitted hes struggling to find rugby balls small enough for Archie to use during a special video chat with quiz of players, coaches and volunteers from Rugby League to mark its th birthdayShareCommentsByRyan Merrield:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video prince-harry-eager-teach-archie-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Harry, who has now settled in Santa Barbara with we Meghan and little Archie, after officially quitting the Firm in March, is the leagueaposs patron. What I need is a few mini rugby balls that I can then get Archie involved with the game, because at the moment itaposs impossible to find any, he told the group.

He had no idea who his royal patient was, but didnapost believe she was in any real danger as she was conscious and had her eyes open. He gave the woman he would later learn was Princess Diana some oxygen before she was taken out of the car, and he held her hand to comfort her. He told her to stay calm. Diana then asked him: My God, whataposs happened  He claims there was no blood on her at all, and although he could see a slight injury to her right shoulder he didnapost believe it to be anything signicant. But just moments later everything changed in a matter of seconds when she suffered a cardiac arrest. Speaking to the  Sun  in , Mr Gourmelon said: I massaged her heart and a few seconds later she started breathing again. It was a relief of course because, as a first responder, you want to save lives — and thataposs what I thought I had done.  To be honest I thought she would live. As far as I knew when she was in the ambulance she was alive and I expected her to live. But I found out later she had died in hospital. It was very upsetting. I know now that there were serious internal injuries, but the whole episode is still very much in my mind. And the memory of that night will stay with me forever. I had no idea then that it was Princess Diana. It was only when she had been put into the ambulance that one of the paramedics told me it was her. She regained consciousness thanks to Mr Gourmelon and his teamaposs CPR efforts, and they thought she was going to survive.

The woman called Jo left the review after visiting The Cowshed at Hucknall, Nottinghamshire, for her sister-in-lawaposs th birthday. She claimed that her party spent approximately £ between them on drinks and pizza before they were asked to leave by staff with awful attitude for being too drunk. In the review Jo wrote, she said: [They] didn’t mind taking the £ though, I have never been spoken to in such a way. Maybe they should open reviews [on their website].She then added: And, yes, our family member was sick, and yes, we cleaned it up so no members of staff were affected by this. Maybe a course for your staff in customer service wouldn’t go amiss – rude staff, huffing and puffing because they had a large round to bring out. But the restaurant, which has a five star rating on TripAdvisor, shared their version of events from the night on Facebook by saying: Hi Jo, thanks for reaching out! We love feedback, whether it be positive or negative, we especially love feedback like this so others can see the type of people we have to deal with sometimes.  Firstly, it said that Jo hadnapost spent the amount of money she claimed she did. To spend that amount of money they would have had to have ordered  of their most expensive pizzas and  of their most expensive drinks... The Cowshed continued: You ordered nowhere near this, Jo... not even close. What you and your party spent, Jo, was a far more realistic and believable £ . Then it got a little brutal.  It added: You all acted like belligerent, entitled little toddlers from the moment you walked through our gates. At :pm you showed up with the tables you wanted already taken, but not to worry, we shuffled other customers about at your request in order to accommodate you.  Then you proceeded to pull our light fittings loose off our boundary fence in order to hang your birthday decor. We cleaned up all the smashed pint glasses you broke and birthday cake you dropped and smeared all over our tables and benches, and tolerated the many loud family rows you were having with each other. The group also supposedly treated The Cowshedaposs staff  like personal servants. It wrote: Clicking your fingers, shouting, swearing and barking your orders at [staff], to the point one was almost in tears and refused to deal with you any more. But it didnapost stop there. He also claimed the group refused to abide by social distancing rules following the coronavirus pandemic. Then, for your partyaposs grand finale, the gentleman in the blue shirt headed into our bar from outside and decided to vomit everywhere but the toilet. Our staff stepped into to help, but you demanded to aposdeal with the situationapos and rather than clean up the mess, proceeded to smear it over an even wider area with our mop, whilst... once again, being loud, rude, sticking your hand in our staffaposs faces and shouting over anybody who was trying to communicate with you or help. Donapost worry, the staff member that you nearly had in tears earlier on cleaned it up for you.

One said: Iaposm glad you posted this response! Coming from a hospitality background having worked in many pubs and restaurants reviews like this can be so damaging and most of the timeextremely untrue and made up! When people read reviews like this they believe the customer is right. Iaposve yet to visit your establishment due to expecting a baby very soon but have only heard positive reviews from friends so hopefully in the next few months will be able to attend! Another wrote: Congratulations Cowshed! You have won the internet today! One woman commented: Never been, didnapost know you existed, but might have to pay a visit now... Another new fan said: Wow. Weaposve never been to the Cowshed but we certainly intend doing so. More so after reading your honest response to Jo who I hope to never meet her or her party. Ever. Another commenter said: Weaposre moving to Hucknall soon, looks like we already have a new fave restaurant!  In the review Jo wrote, she said: [They] didn’t mind taking the £ though, I have never been spoken to in such a way. Maybe they should open reviews [on their website].

Putting rule breakers together into detention could risk further spreading the virus and so it has been deemed safer to send them back home. A letter sent out by Jerome Scafe, an associate principal at Ark Alexandra Academy in Hastings, East Sussex, warned even jokes about the killer bug are banned. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.   Seen by the Daily Mail, the letter said undesirable behaviours may result in a fixed-term exclusion.This included deliberate or malicious coughs sneezes, inappropriate comments about Covid- and purposeful physical contact with others. It added repeated failure to follow the rules could see pupils needing to be removed from lesson.  Byron Academy in Acton, West London, meanwhile, has warned coughing deliberately on someone  is now potentially extremely serious and those wilfully ignoring restrictions face possible exclusion. John Flamsteed Community School in Derby has said specic toilets have been earmarked for break and lunch for certain students and this must be adhered to or will be treated as a very serious disciplinary matter. All schools want pupilsapos unorms washed every day, though ties canapost be worn, andthey have sport on their timetable that day children must arrive at school in their PE kit. "},{"url":null,"title":"schools coronavirus covid opening rules","story":"AdvertorialAll the things which are changing as schools and colleges open doors againEducational institutions are ready to welcome pupils back safely – and the benefits to their wellbeing and mental health are hugeShareByDave Masters:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG AdvertorialIt’s the start of a new term and it’s time for children across the country to get back to school, nursery and college. Many parents, pupils and teachers are excited to get back into the routine and although it’s understandable to have a few worries the benefits of going back into education are clear. Not only will pupils be learning again, but they’ll benefit from the sense of routine, the chance to see their friends and a boost to their wellbeing. With new safety measures in place things will look a bit dferent, but pupils will be guaranteed plenty of support from their teachers.  Dr Paul Phillips CBE, , the Principal and Chief Executive of the Weston College Group in Somerset is one of many leaders who’s worked hard to make the learning environment safe and welcoming for ing students. He said: If you came into my campuses you’d see the one-way system, you’d see all the sanitisers, you’d see the counselling service, you’d see the ability for us to check temperatures, but behind that are the inidual learning plans for each student. That’s where the crucial planning really takes place. We’ve increased the number of mental health advisors and support workers who are here, we’ve put a massive investment into all levels of additional learning support at tutorial level, mentoring and one-to-one teaching. I’ve doubled the amount of cleaners in the college – I just need to be assured that everything we do is protecting everyone.  Home schooling hasn’t been easy and many parents are worried that their children have fallen behind, but parenting expert and author Dr Kalanit Ben-Ari believes they’ll catch up quickly and that getting back into the classroom will boost their mental health. I’m not worried about the academic gap, because I think kids will pick up very quickly. But it’s starting to affect their mental health more and more, so it’s good that they will be back in school from September, says Dr Ben-Ari. Children are not designed to sit down all day. They need to be out in the fresh air and moving their bodies. It’s so important for children of all ages to interact with their friends face to face for communication, and non-verbal communication.  Kids at home have spent a long time on screens while parents are working and they don’t have the resources to entertain and teach their children at home. Spending more time on screens will have affected their mental health: it increases anxiety, especially with children who are a little bit more vulnerable to it. For Chloe Williams, a beauty therapy student at Weston College, thecan’t come soon enough. I feel ready to go for a long-awaited  and seeing the new socially distanced facilities has been great, she says. My tutors are very approachableI have any worries and we are all helping each other. The PHE’s Chief Nurse, Viv Bennett, says: Parents can be reassured that to maximise safety in schools, an extremely stringent system of controls has been advised by PHE and is published in DfE guidance. Evidence so far indicates that schools do not appear to be a primary driver of coronavirus infections in the community. Globally, children and young people have been found to experience coronavirus asymptomatically or as a minor illness.  The Government’s new Wellbeing for Education Return package has training and resources for teachers and young people to protect their wellbeing and mental health. Now the NHS Test and Trace system is up and running and there’s more understanding about what needs to be done to stay safer. Children should stay at homethey have any symptoms such as a fever, continuous cough or loss of taste and smell. If there is an outbreak at a school or college, local health protection teams will work with staff to agree what action is needed. Schools shouldn’t need to close fully, butthey do there’ll be a contingency plan in place to make sure children’s education continues. It’s vital that young peopleto school and college for their educational progress, mental wellbeing and wider development, so attendance is mandatory from the beginning of the new school year. For post-, attendance is important becausea student doesn’t turn up their college may believe they’ve left the course. Schools and colleges have put in a raft of measures to keep pupils and staff safe, including staggered start and finish times and lunch breaks, one-way systems, extra cleaning and encouraging regular handwashing. Where it’s dficult to maintain social distancing, with younger children, contact between groups or “bubbles” will be limited. This means things will look a little dferent, soparents or young people are anxious or worried about ing, they should have a chat with teachers. Parents with younger children are encouraged to take up a nursery place because it provides a routine and helps them develop their social skills. The Government offers a wide range of financial support for families with children aged up to , including Tax-Free Childcare worth up to £, per child per year and you can also apply for a  hours free childcare place before  August.

The Met Office said that although the bank holiday has been unseasonably cool, the low temperatures are not expected to break any records. The mercury will struggle to exceed C in London though, with sunshine in short supply. The chilly spell is in stark contrast to last yearaposs late August Bank Holiday Monday which was the hottest on record, when the mercury hit .C at Heathrow airport. Alex Burkill, meteorologist at the Met Office, said that the iety of hot, cold and windy weather would likely not be reflected in the monthly averages. Weaposve not broken any records with how cold itaposs got, he said. Daytime temperaturesdid struggle, but the lowest maximum temperature was .C and the record is .C, so weaposre quite far off that. Monday daytime temperatures will struggle again, probably only just about getting into double figures in some places, but Iaposd be surprisedwe broke any records. It has been quite extreme at times, weaposve had some very hot weather and then the two storms towards the end of the month, he said.  Even this bank holiday has been unseasonably cool, itaposs not that often that we get temperatures around freezing in August.  has brought everything this month and thataposs not really going to be captured in the monthly averages.

Last week, the UK was battered by Storm Francis, which saw gusts of mph hit The Needles near the Isle of Wight, just days after Storm Ellen had struck.  The Met said it was unseasonable to have two named storms occur in August within such a short period. Itaposs not that usual for us to get these types of storms in August, in fact itaposs the first time weaposve ever had a named storm in August, said Mr Burkill. To then have another one week after the other is even more extreme. The storms followed a spell of blistering heat, which included a high of .Cat Heathrow and Kew Gardens - the hottest August day recorded in  years.

Emily Sawyer, , said she didnapost really think much of the skin tag on her neck and assumed it was a harmless growth of skin. It was only when her work lanyard began to rub against it and make it bleed that Emily, from London, decided to go to the doctors in September  to seeit could be removed. After removing the skin tag during Emilyaposs original appointment, the problem seemed to be solved. The skin tag was sent away for analysis but only as a routine precaution. Five days later, Emily received a call to say that it was in fact skin cancer and she would need surgery. In April , Emily underwent aposMohs surgeryapos a treatment for skin cancer on her face to remove a cancerous area found around her nose. Skin was taken from the cancerous site along with a further one-millimetre area from around it, which was repeated until the extra millimetre is tested as being cancer-free.  The cancer on Emilyaposs face was found during an inspection three-months after the original skin tag tested positive. The surgery which lasted over four hours - was done under local anaesthetic. After I got the diagnosis on my skin tag, I went back to the doctor and he had to check my entire body for moles and tags, Emily, a special education needs teacher, said. The doctor spotted a small skin-coloured mole on my face, next to my nose, and I went for a biopsy. This was identied as being cancerous so they performed the Mohs surgery.  They removed the mole along with an extra millimetre around the edge. I asked the surgeon what couldaposve caused this and he said it was just bad luck. It was quite strange being awake for it all, but the nurse chatted to me the whole way through. The removal part of the surgery lasted for around three hours. It then took a further hour-and-a-half to stitch me back up. After around four-and-a-half-hours, I heard the best words ever. aposNo further treatment required.apos  The worst part was going through the operation alone. I planned to fly to my mum in Ireland for the recovery period but due to the pandemic, I stayed in London. It was quite painful for about seven-days after the surgery. My lip was swollen and I lived on icy drinks as my mouth was burning. It made it dficult to eat. I was shocked when I originally got the diagnosis as was my doctor. It was a very surreal moment as I really did only think it was an ordinary skin tag.  Iaposm an active and outgoing person. I really enjoy the gym and sport and my job certainly keeps me on my toes. I didnapost use sunbeds. When I originally went to the doctors, I was told it was normal to send them for analysis and that there was nothing to worry about. Emily now has the all clear but is keen to encourage others to get checked-outthereaposs anything theyaposre concerned about. Proactively seeking help is the right thing to do.

The animal lover jumped over the garden fence, ed into the pool and pulled the pooch to safety. Lukaaposs owners were just hours into a family holiday when animal control rang them to say an Amazon driver had saved their dog.Describing the rescue, Mr Cassabria told CBS : I saw what looked like a snout and at that moment my heart sank.I jumped into the pool with everything on.

Damien Turner, , has been part of the adult baby diaper lover communityfor ten years and wears nappies all day. The US nappy-lover, from West Virginia, said acting like a baby gives off a very calm relaxing and safe vibe but that his lestyle has caused problems in his professional le. Currently unemployed, he is constantly in and out of jobs and has been fired by previous employers for being childish. Speaking to , Damien said: Diapers are very convenient, comfortable, and cute. It’s a very nice lestyle and I wouldn’t want to do anything .  Dressing and acting like a baby gives off a very calm, relaxing, safe vibe. It’s almost asyou were back in preschool without a worry in the world. Employment is hard. Iaposm constantly in and out of jobs. Sometimes my employers find my pictures online or just canapost put up with the fact Iaposm wearing a diaper and acting childish in the workplace. Damien never hides his lestyle choice but has lost friends and is often teased outside of work. He has since been welcomed into the ABDL community who have helped him feel at home.He said : Iaposve lost a few childhood best friends. I do still have a few good friends that all know about it. I never hide it. If you are around me, itaposs just the norm. The adult baby used to work in the catering industry as a service coordinator and is open about his lestyle on social media. He claims bosses felt uncomfortable by his actions and he is now forced to live off his savings after being fired.Damien said:I have enough saved up for a while but at the moment I’m currently putting in job applications. So we’ll see how that goes. Since childhood, Damien has had a desire to wear nappies and has been wearing them since he was . He initially told his parents, who support his lestyle, that he had an incontinence problem and fully embraced the lestyle during his teen years.  Damien added: ‘It’s something I’ve always been into since I was a kid. If I really had to pin it to something I’d say episodes of SpongeBob or Tom and Jerry where they are wearing a diaper for a gag or throwaway joke. I found it very appealing and have pretty much been wearing them since I was . I lied and told my parents I had an [incontinence] problem at the time so they would buy me some. Eventually, I told them the truth. My parents don’t really mind at all, I’ve never had a problem with them when it came to my lestyle. Despite the support from his family, Damien has been poked fun at on the street and faced cyberbullying where people post memes of him.

The race is on to immunise the world against Covid-, which has already killed over , people, but scientists have warned politicians and commercial companies to be cautious. Without comprehensive results showing at least -% effectiveness, vaccines risk doing more harm than good, they claim.On Friday, ministers unveiled a raft of measures designed to fast track the roll-out of any potential coronavirus vaccine in the UK. The temporary law change could see any vaccine given a green light to be dished out to Brits without going through the usual product approval system. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  Scientists at Oxford developing a vaccine have said they hope to have something ready for regulators to examine before .While US president Donald Trump wants a vaccine before the presidential election in November.However, Professor Sir Richard Peto, of Oxford University and an adviser to the World Health Organization, said an initial vaccine with low efficacy would lower the bench mark and lead to even more inferior ones down the line. He told : I think there’s a big rush, a somewhat nationalistic rush and also somewhat capitalistic rush as well, to be absolutely first to register a vaccine, and it will actually make it more dficult to evaluate other vaccines.While admitting a vaccine is needed soon, he added: We really do need quite strong evidence of efficacy. Downing Streetaposs plan for emergency measures to ensure it could licence a vaccine this year would override any approval from the European Medicines Agency.  Post-Brexit, however, the UK will be free to license its own vaccines and drugs. Prof Peto is a member of the WHOaposs Solidarity Vaccines Trial Expert Group, which last week warned a poor vaccine could be worse than none at all.The group told - fulltext\" rel\"nofollow\"the Lancet medical journal:  Deployment of a weakly effective vaccine could actually worsen the Covid- pandemicauthorities wrongly assume it causes a substantial reduction in risk, orvaccinated iniduals wrongly believe they are immune, hence reducing implementation of, or compliance with, other Covid- control measures.They went on to say they favoured the Solidarity trials, which compare numerous vaccines from around the world as part of a shared control group, rather than inidual trials. The UK government has insisted that any drug will only be passedit meets the highest safety and quality standards and it will put reinforced safeguards in place.

The young girl, whose surname was Lin, was at the  International Kite Festival in the city when a kite with a long strip was blown violently by the wind. This kite somehow became tangled around Linaposs stomach and she was pulled into the sky.Lin is thankfully ok, only suffering minor scratches according to Taiwan News, but it was terrying for everyone.A video shared on social media seems to show the girl swinging in the air for a few seconds before someone pulled the kite down. She was pretty high up, and the video shows her twisting through the air as shocked onlookers canapost believe what theyaposre seeing. There was lots of screaming and shouting, but thankfully a group of people caught the girl when she fell. Lin was then sent to hospital by staff at the event with her mum for a check over, although as reported, she was ok."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/08/2.55115866-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/08/2.55115866-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/08/2.55115866-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/08/2.55115866-1-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"abertay university helps to organise first fully online women in games global conference","story":"A conference celebrating woman in videogames is to take place completely online for the first time.Abertay University is helping to organise the first fully digital Women in Games Global Conference, an event which celebrates and showcases the work of women in the videogames industry.So far over  people have signed up to the event, breaking previous attendance records.The event will include live-streamed talks,  discussions, workshops as well as networking opportunities and an interactive virtual expo showcasing new games, tech, products and services.Abertay#s Professor Ruth Falconer, Head of Division of Games Technology and Mathematics  is part of the organising committee.

But he has to find that consistency to stay in the team.#As far as interest in him, then I#m delighted for him. I hope there is because that means I#ve got good players here.#I wouldn#t want an empty scouting bay as that would mean people had made their mind up about my team.#I have no problem in teams taking an interest but it honestly won#t deflect away from every day improvement and trying to win games of football.#Mellon will come up against a familiar face in the opposition dug-out on Saturday when he takes United to Rugby Park to take on Alex Dyer#s Kilmarnock.Mellon knows the Englishman well from his time south of the border and while he insists there will be no old pal#s act this weekend, he is confident his friend can turn Killie#s campaign around after seeing them open up the season with just two points from the opening five games.The former Shrewsbury and Tranmere boss said: #I#ve known Alex for a long, long time. He#s a real good football man. I#ve competed against him numerous times.#I remember him and Chris Powell at Charlton and again at Huddersfield, so I know him really well.#I know that he will make sure his team are ready and we#ll have to overcome that challenge.#I#ve no doubt he can get Kilmarnock out of the situation they#re in. It doesn#t even need me to justy that.#Given his experience in football and the type of guy he is, you can#t look at him and think he doesn#t have the know-how to win games at any time.#It#s always dficult when you get both Rangers and Celtic in your first five fixtures.#But we know we#ll have to go down to Rugby Park and get an awful lot right.#We#ve shown in the first five games that we#re a match for anyone.#What we need to find is the consistency of that performance over a league season.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Talking nonsense in the public or lounge bar can be very therapeutic#People are also being encouraged to switch to a tourist#s mindset and visit local attractions to help put a bit of flesh on their bones and see them through the winter.Buying local has knock-on environmental benefits too, often involving shorter journeys and sustainably produced local products.Shopping local has always been important, but never more than now.If we don#t use local services, we will lose them.

I share many of his concerns, and commend the series of articles.It would be good to hear from a range of Argyll and Bute residents with their ideas for how we get from #here# towards a better #there#. My personal pet project would be an Argyll and Bute Citizens’ Assembly, that would bring people together to generate real strategies to bring about just and #green# change for our area.A good start would be better transport links, via enhanced road and ferry services.A permanent solution to the Rest and be Thankful would be welcome, of course, but it was really heartening to see how Western Ferries rose to the challenge on Friday Auust .  They magicked away that endless queue at Gourock with great patience and goodwill and double service, showing what can be done.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,Following the latest landslide and road closure at the Rest and be Thankful, once again the road closure signs were placed at the wrong place on the Arrochar side.Having spoken to several of the local businesses owners, the main issue around the signs are they are too far away from the incident.

This is now brought into line with the public transport guidance.What about primary school children With the exception of school buses as outlined above, the new guidance in schools only applies to secondary school pupils.Do they need to be worn in class While staff and students can continue to wear face coveringsthey wish to, they will not generally be necessary in the classroom.This is because there is greater scope for physical distancing and face coverings can have an impact on teaching.However it remains the case that where adults cannot keep m distance and are interacting face-to-face for a sustained period , face coverings should be wornCan a child be excluded for not wearing one It is expected that the guidance will state that pupils should notbe excluded from schoolthey do not wish to wear a face covering.Can someone help my child with their covering Education Secretary John Swinney said:ldquoSchools will be asked to ensure children and young people have clear instructions on how to put on, remove, and store face coverings.\"Any staff member or pupil will still be able to wear a face covering when they wish to do so.\"John Swinney confirmed the new guidanceWhy is this being done Mr Swinney added:ldquoThere is increasing evidence that face coverings can provide some protection for the wearer as well as those around them.\"We also know that some pupils have found it very dficult to physically distance when moving around school, which could increase the risk of transmission of the virus.\"And on school transport, as on public transport, there can be mixing between dferent age groups.\"What  was said Mr Swinney said:ldquoWe want to continue to protect what we have achieved in suppressing the virus and re-opening schools, and to do the best for children in schools.\"Alongside this change to the wearing of face coverings, we need to reinforce the importance of maintaining high standards of cleaning, personal hand and respiratory hygiene and physical distancing, where possible.\"In situations where there is a local cluster, use of face coverings throughout the day may be required.ldquoThe position will be kept under review to ensure that our

It was the sound of their wings that caught my attention before I saw them. It was a lockdown morning, no traffic, no background sound, and they were flying low.I never have been much of a bird watcher well, what I mean is I have always loved sightings of wildle, including birds, but donrsquot sit for hours to spot dferent types. I know the names of some birds but many I canrsquot identy with certainty. My friend Jim is my human encyclopaedia for such things.Of course, we can still appreciate nature and wildle without being able to identy their exact names. A beautul tree is still worthy of admiration, evenyou donrsquot knowitrsquos an oak or a sycamore. You can enjoy the antics of a flock of birds, evenyoursquore not surethey are martins or swts.And there are some wild creatures we all know and can identy: a fox, a robin, a hedgehog, a squirrel, a rabbit, a mole, a deer, a dandelion, a daisy, a heron, a swan, a duck and a hare would be on this list, but itrsquos not as extensive as it used to be. As nature has receded from our lived experiences, so has the ability to identy and name much of the wildle and plants that survive around us.The beautully illustrated book The Lost Words by Jackie Morris and Robert MacFarlane was a response to this loss of nature vocabulary. With beautul pictures and poems, it brings back to le some of the animals and flora of our land. And resources like the ranger service do a fantastic job in our county, providing walks, giving fascinating information and talking to a iety of groups.But itrsquos the lived experience of nature that is the vital link between having knowledge and developing an understanding that will nurture a love of our natural environment. We cannot really love that which we do not experience and value personally. Itrsquos when we physically encounter a plant or animal that we develop a desire to know its name and understand its signicance.This seems a perfect time to find ways to enhance that lived experience of nature. In schools, because of the presence of Covid, learning outdoors as much as possible is being promoted. Some schools will have access to woodland or natural areas more than others. Some schools in built-up areas will be more restricted. But even in urban areas, there may be a grassy area with a tree or two, or perhaps a nature corner can be created.Teachers do a great job, and they are doing so in very challenging circumstances just now they know their business. But as a storyteller who until the lockdown was in schools every week telling stories, I am unable to do so in these new circumstances. I fully understand why, of course.But as things develop, it may be possible for storytelling to take place outdoors, wersquoll see. For me this is not so much a restriction but a new opportunity to make nature the stage, with listeners immersed in the natural surroundings in which so many stories are set. Evenonly concrete playground is currently available, there is potential to make more of the outdoor space now that it will be used in a dferent way.As I say, time will tell what will be possible. My interest is not just as a storyteller but also as a parent. Itrsquos a time to be cautious and safe, yes, but let us not forget the vital importance of the creative arts in all this. Many children have missed out on so much already, and music, song, storytelling and drama are such a vital part of childrenrsquos development and soul indeed for us all. Perhaps we all need to relearn the campfire spirit, around which so much human culture and understanding developed.And so my thoughtsto the swts which flew over my garden. They will now be flying over Africa, following the rains and chasing the insects there. Their story is utterly fascinating a lesson in natural and human history, as well as geography, biology and ecology.Soon the pink-footed geese from Iceland will arrive in their honking formations, to spend their winter here. Irsquove noticed some trees are showing they already feel the nip of autumn. The cycle of naturersquos stories are all around us,we have an ear to listen and eye to notice.More learning outdoors is a gt. Letrsquos make the most of it."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-august-25-28-1995-1970-1920","story":"A POTENTIALLY fatal craze in Dunbar was highlighted in the East Lothian Courier on August , .Children as young as  are risking their lives by ing ft into Dunbar harbour.The fine summer weather has enticed groups of youngsters to put on their swimming trunks and leap into the water at the harbour entrance.And warnings that their antics could be fatal have only moved the boys on to even more dangerous jumps into the rocky sea near the ruined castle.Dunbar community policeman PC David Munro said that the craze had been going on for several weeks and the dozen-strong group ldquodid not seem to appreciate the dangers.ldquoApart from the diesel, oil and other chemicals that are floating on the surface, the kids are also at risk from the boats that are coming in and out, he said.ldquoThey could easily fall on to rocks belowthey slipped or lost their footing and it is also worrying that younger children are coming along and want to imitate the older ones.A NEW school opened in Haddington, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of August , .Haddingtonrsquos new school ndash Kingrsquos Meadow Primary School ndash opened its doors to pupils for the first time on Monday.The school, which cost about pound, to build, can accommodate  pupils.Built by James Harrison and CoLtd., Edinburgh, it was designed by Mr Colin Stewart, a Haddington man employed as an architect by the firm.

more about Test and Protect ##But when should children be tested Ms Sturgeon stressed that parents should not automatically seek a Covid test for cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose.She said: ldquoWhile itrsquos understandable that parents in particular want to err on the side of caution, itrsquos also important to remember the symptoms of Covid that trigger the need for a test: a new persistent cough, a fever, a loss or change in sense of taste or smell.ldquoOther symptoms like a runny nose -they are not accompanied by one of the Covid symptoms - should not lead to a test.Itrsquos not just coronavirus that parents should be looking out for ndash with one expert suggesting that social bubbles could be the ldquoperfect breeding ground for other back-to-school bugs to develop.Writing in The Sun, TV presenter and GP, Dr Hilary Jones put together a symptom checker to help parents understand what may be wrong.He also reminded people to book the flu jab ahead of the

I really wanted to get the role.IN WHAT WAYS DID YOU SEE YOURSELF IN THE CHARACTER Even physically we were quite similar. He talks about having a wiry strength from the long walks around the Yorkshire Dales... And I was very sporty as well, just like Alf was.Hes got a lot of passion and commitment to his field and that was like me. Once I found acting, I was completely enveloped in it - and havent looked back.He has little intricacies sometimes he can be a little socially awkward... Little quirks that I could identy with. I had fun with them as well.HOW DAUNTING WAS YOUR FIRST DAY OF FILMING I thought Id be more nervous or apprehensive on the first day of filming I really wasnt, and it was a fortunate revelation.My first day was with Samuel West - obviously a veteran of the industry. I was so excited to work with him and then, on top of that, he was just so lovely. Any questions I had, he was there for me.He just put me at ease straight away and, its maybe a bit corny, but I genuinely did feel at home on that first day.HOW DO YOU THINK FANS OF THE ORIGINAL SERIES WILL REACT TO THIS ADAPTATION The original is obviously loved the world over- and in a lot of peoples eyes, its perfect. But Ive never thought of it as a competition in any way, because its a completely new adaptation. The storyline will not be the exact same.That series was the late seventies, eighties, and the technology in filmmaking has come on leaps and bounds. Youre going to see the Dales in stunning HD, with drone shots and crane shots. I think the Dales are really realised in this it is like another character.WHO WAS YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL TO FILM WITH Theyve got these Jersey cows who were just lovely. When youre working with these bigger animals, a whole new focus comes into it. Theres an atmosphere on set you have to be really calm. So it was nice to do those scenes.But also the little dog who plays Tricky Woo, which people will remember well from the series and the books, is a little Pomeranian... tail waggles in the air as he walks along, you cant see his legs and its kind of like he glides. But the dog actor is actually called Derek. You would never expect this fancy little thing to be called Derek!He was a consummate professional and his character journey over the series is very strong. Hes going to be a star.WERE YOU BROUGHT UP AROUND ANIMALS I was raised in the north of Scotland, in a little town. It was my back garden, then a fence and then a field the field always had cows and sheep in it.When we were really small, there was one cow who we named Friendly because the farmer would lt us onto her back and let us ride on this cow for theof the garden and take us off again.THIS SERIES SHOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF BELONGING TO A COMMUNITY. IT FEELS VERY TIMELY...Its certainly that thing about helping your neighbour, and community, and coming together... [after schools shut because of COVID-] I remember a teacher going out with his backpack on full of school meals and he was doing kilometres a day to get meals to the kids. Brilliant stuff.I think it [All Creatures Great and Small] is simpler times and something many people yearn for, especially now, when times are a bit more complex. It will be a lovely bit of escapism.ARE YOU READY FOR THE FAME THAT WILL COME WITH THIS ROLE Honestly, I have no idea. In drama school, theres no class on people noticing you in the street. We were doing some interviews during the filming of the series and they were like, You will get fan mail. I was like I wont get fan mail and they were like, You will!

All have a strong hold over the upbeat, poppy tracks that in dferent circumstances would have been certied dancefloor classics.Certainly Perry doesnt shy away from being honest, with lyrics such as \"Ill cry about it later, tonight Im having fun\", and \"Just keep on dancing with those teary eyes\", flowing over disco beats and electronic sounds.But theres a triumphant edge to the album, and Perry brings her lighthearted trademark sound to the proceedings, \"Im faithful, baby\" is an uplting lyric that will compel you to sing along at the top of your voice, and \"Ill regrow right through the cracks\" is the audio equivalent of a joyful plateau after rising out of a depressive episode.While Smile isnt % cohesive as an album, its a collection of singles that were made to be sure-fire number ones, andthey cant pack a dance floor thanks to social distancing, theyll have you singing along, revelling in their powerful message.Sophie GoodallPVRIS - USE MEUse Me is the album that sees PVRIS step out of the shadows while retaining the darkness that has always surrounded them.\"Wide awake, just cut the head off of a snake\", Lynn Gunn sings on opener Gimme A Minute, to dramatic synth chords and urgent bass.The Lowell, Massachusetts band have come a long way from their metalcore beginnings, with their third full album completing the journey into stadium electropop.Thats not the only change, as Gunn this year found the confidence to step out as the sole creative force behind PVRIS - pronounced Paris, the original name before being changed for legal reasons.Drummer Justin Nace left in January, with guitarist Alex Babinski and bassist Brian Macdonald fading into the background on videos, artwork and merch.Use Me is delayed from May and while its release at the end of summer fits the goth elements, PVRIS missed out on a summer of touring and festivals that would have surely lted them to the next level.The tour is delayed to spring but the charismatic Gunn is a star in waiting and there is no reason why PVRIS should not be huge after this supremely confident album.They embrace pop fully on Stay Gold, Hallucinations and Wish You Well, while the title track has an alternate version featuring rising New Jersey rapper  Shake, hinting at future new directions.The shadows remain, and on Good To Be Alive Gunn sings \"feels good to be alive, but I hate my le\", while other tracks are called Death Of Me, Old Wounds and Loveless, an acoustic ballad, but they never sound miserable, saved by panache and some jet-propelled choruses. may have been a washout for live music, but thanks to Use Me, well always have PVRIS.Matthew GeorgeGIANT ROOKS - ROOKERYGermanys Giant Rooks offer more than just an intriguing name on their debut album, which melds classic indie with modern soul flavours.Album opener The Birth Of Worlds, a shock of cascading drum rolls and cinematic synths, suggests a more experimental album than ever materialises.But it is a fine showcase for frontman Frederik Rabes throaty voice, which takes centre-stage throughout Rookerys  songs and holds up some of the weaker cuts.Rabes swaggering, half-sung delivery hints towards a confidence that never quite shows up in the songwriting.Subsequent songs like Watershed and Wild Stare stray towards the derivative, drawing from the sanitised RB of Jungle and the quirky aesthetics of Alt-J.This formula works better when Giant Rooks go full pelt like on Heat Up, which features a taut disco beat.There are plenty of lyrics - some nonsensical - about hip-swinging clubs and souls being set on fire by love.Into Your Arms unexpectedly transforms into an auto-tuned slow jam and, oddly, works.You have to admire their bravery.It is a promising debut that would have helped Giant Rooks storm festival stages worldwide in pre-Covid times.Alex GreenMETALLICA -

The negotiating and working staff teams are deep on talent, many being career civil servants and non-partisan trade diplomats. There are  US and UK support staff from ious agencies with nearly  negotiating groups. In the third round alone, there were  sessions and  dferent workstreams. The fourth round is expected to convene in early September. Even with this accelerated pace, reaching the finish line and breaking the tape for an agreement by the end of the year is, in the words of Ambassador Lighthizer, ldquonearly impossible. The UK also is stretched on other negotiating fronts including the higher priority of the EU. Evena deal is reached, the US Congress will need to approve it, and the days in session before the end of year during a hotly contested election are limited.The distinctive voice of Scotland in these negotiations is vital. Dr Liz Cameron, CEO of Scottish Chambers that forms  Chambers of Commerce across Scotlandrsquos towns, regions and cities, is an effective promoter for Scottish business for the negotiations because she sits on the UK Strategic Trade Advisory Group. Truss has also been proactive in assembling  trade advisory groups across the UK to, in her words, ldquokeep businesses closer to the negotiating table.Keith Anderson, CEO of Scottish Power, sits on one of the advisory groups. However, that Scottish voice needs to not only be internal to the UK. It is critical for the United States and other countries to understand the unique values and economic sectors that comprise the Scottish economy and society, and, for that matter Wales, Northern Ireland, and England. To look at the UK through too wide an aperture will prevent businesses, investors, and government policy-makers from gaining a deeper understanding of how to strategically engage and successfully partner with business and entities across sectors and regions.Scotland is a trading nation, confidently operating on the global stage. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Trade Minister Ivan McKee have consistently emphasised this point, and the Scottish Government is investing in building export capacity through the ldquoExport Challenge. The number one international export country for Scotland is the United States. The latest trade data shows this figure was approximately pound. billion per year. Further, US and international businesses are increasingly attracted to Scotland for engagement and direct investment. Scottish Chambers of Commerce have as many as  trade missions to US cities each year.When the US government understands how deep and valued the trading and cultural relationship is they will not move to impose  percent tarfs as they did on a range of Scottish products, including single malt whisky, cashmere, sweet biscuits, cheese, and wool items. Those tarfs are neither good economic policy nor constructive diplomatic practice for allies. As Minister McKee has said, ldquoScottish businesses are being hit hard by these tarfs and jobs and livelihoods are now at risk. These tarfs have also negatively impacted on American consumers and importers. They should have never happened. With advocacy from Truss and Scottish government and industry leaders, the US has committed to lt some of the tarfs, but, unfortunately, some still remain.The US and UK trade negotiations offer a backdrop and an opportunity for Scottish enterprise to be heard. This is happening, but it needs to go much deeper. US decision-makers and Members of Congress would be wise to encourage this direct channel of dialogue, and Scottish industry and enterprise networks prudent to proactively nurture it. Eventhere is no trade agreement by the end of the year, the results of substantive briefings by Scottish enterprise leaders will reinforce an historically close relationship, spark a realisation of the many growth sectors that exist and can be forged, and heighten recognition of what makes Scotland a unique market. That approach would be beneficial to us all now and going forward.Ian Houston has spent a long career in Washington, DC, as an international non-profit leader, and a policy advocate for diplomatic engagement and global poverty alleviation.

Adaptability is key to business survival, but a strong workforce is the cornerstone to success.Employers should foster an atmosphere that encourages their employees to seek and enter higher education part-time. Myriad benefits outweigh the potential costs involved.In fact, there may be access to funding and grants to support training at a post-graduate or Masters level - The Data Lab, Scotlandrsquos innovation centre for data and AI, runs several data-related courses in partnership with  universities in Scotland, and can help with funding too.Investing in your workforce greatly reduces staff turnover, saving a huge amount of money, given that the cost of replacing an employee is thought to exceed pound,.As we enter a new period of economic uncertainty, it feels more important than ever to foster further learning in the workplace.If not right now, investment in training, upskilling, and reskilling should be considered in the months and years to come, allowing staff to manage more than one discipline, and future proofing your business against a similar impact.From developing staff to become more confident in their roles, to retraining or reskilling existing staff to take on new roles, or bringing in innovative new solutions that you might otherwise have never come across, the benefits certainly outweigh any reservations.Raymond Martin is a graduate of The Data Labrsquos MSc Programme at Edinburgh Napier University"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-prue-leith-ken-buchanan-combo","story":"EWE couldnrsquot make it up.

Itrsquos fineyou are alone, orboth of you have been on a diet, but less so in any other circumstances. It does, however, have the advantage of being above the kitchen, and thus the second warmest place in the house.

While Alan slapped glossy woodwork paint onto the ceiling, wondering why it was so hard to work in, we discussed the advantages of cast iron bedsteads over wooden, Scandi sleekness over shabby chic. Gradually, though, the need to make a decision receded. As the weeks ticked past and Europe turned into a giant hairbrush, covered in spikes, all such international trips have been cancelled or pushed back a year.Even in the best of times, when it comes to hospitality we are more roadside burger van than country inn. Where we previously lived, we did occasionally have friends and family to stay, but it was not what yoursquod call a revolving door. More of a portcullis. It was noticeable, though, that after we moved to the Borders, footfall increased.What does Hoolet have that East Lothian or Glasgow doesnrsquot, you might ask  Itrsquos a question to which others, clearly, also wanted an answer. In my seven-year-old step-granddaughterrsquos experience, the big dference is a roaring fire, and the witchy shadows of moving trees on her bedroom wall during the night which, she told us next morning, ldquoliterally petried me.Peter Maylersquos A Year in Provence was the first and funniest of a genre that offers a humorously enticing glimpse of moving to another country, and meeting head-on the challenges of local lingo and customs while undergoing house restoration. One of the late Maylersquos charms ndash assuming you were not a neighbour ndash was his candour. He describes near strangers inviting themselves for a holiday, entirely oblivious or resistant to every excuse given to dissuade them. In that initial year he and his we learned their mistake: ldquoHalf-forgotten invitations, made in the distant safety of winter, were coming home to roost and drink and sunbathe. The girl in the laundry assumed from our sheet count that we were in the hotel business...At one particularly low point, with a boorish London advertiser in residence, they sat by the pool and ldquowondered why we both found it so dficult to get rid of thick-skinned and ungracious people. They realised then that in future theyrsquod require more than ldquofirmness and ingenuity. What they needed was an answering machine.The lucrative and entertaining well that Mayle dug is still gushing. Quite apart from the ever-popular Frances Mayesrsquos books, which turned the word Tuscany into a synonym for bourgeois, there have been quieter, better books. One such is A Season in Spain, by Andrew and Lesley Grant-Adamson. Taking on a fruit farm in Andalusia for two years, they lived among peasant farmers whose families have worked the land for centuries. Despite the excellence of local food and wine, they learned how tough and precarious subsistence living can be in a region that goes from scorching heat to freezing, from drought to deluge.They too had unwanted guests: ldquoQuiet. Remote. The essence of tranquillity  Not quite. We ed from our first foray to find a young English family stripping one of our few ripe orange trees. The man was wearing a cheeky grin and a hat that put us in mind of Eddie Grundy of The Archers. He and his we carried off sackfuls of oranges, using the Grant-Adamsonrsquos wheelbarrow to transport them to their mule. Meanwhile their children were stripping the mandarin trees.Fashion in travel writing has since turned the compass towards Scandinavia, Latin America, Japan, but the principle of all these books remains the same: hapless, starry-eyed foreigners stumble into a beautul and rural part of the world, and either makes a success of settling, or eventually, after discovering a worm in the apple, acknowledge defeat and retreat.The danger in any such enterprise, of course, is not poisonous reptiles or a poor grasp of grammar, but that writers have a tendency to hyperbolise. An ordinary day, in their hands, becomes the stuff of adventure, romance or glamour. Mayle was a former advertising copy writer, so could sell turnips as truffles. Not that he had to try very hard. Since Provence offers months of sunshine, sumptuous local cuisine and wine, and rolling fields of lavender, itrsquos no surprise that visitors flocked to his doorstep. His books became such a success that the whole region, previously an idyllic backwater, was flooded with tourists. So too Mayesrsquos Tuscany.Writing about the Borders carries no such risk, unless yoursquore keen to test out equipment for a trip to the North Pole. We once encountered a man who had a weekend place in the nearby hills.

Suddenly % doesnt seem so ruinous now that the UK deficit is heading to % and Britains debt pile is over pound trillion. Rishi Sunak has borrowed nearly ten times the Scottish budget in six months. Curiously, the roof hasnt fallen in.The whole debate over debt has radically altered as even Conservatives have abandoned the discredited logic of austerity. The ldquocost of a budget deficit, crucially, depends on interest rates. As the UK government and the Bank of England keep telling us, interest rates are currently so low that financiers and banks are actually paying the governmentto take their money.Suddenly, independence doesnt seem such an expensive luxury. There are many issues and problems associated with independence since Brexit, but GERS isnt one of them. The figures are anyway largely discredited. Whatever GERS measures it isnt economic viability.Scotland has labour productivity and employment levels comparable to England with a highly educated workforce, world class universities and a developed financial sector. It also has prodigious natural resources, both hydrocarbon and renewable, plus high-value food and drinks brands. Few countries would be a safer bet for foreign investors.However, there is no disguising that independence would entail readjustment, hard choices, even a degree of sacrice in the interest of reconstructing the underdeveloped Scottish economy. Just like Brexit in fact. No pain, no gain. GERS is,anything, an index of dependency: a measure of how Scotland has lost out being a backwater of the UK, not a country with the economic powers ndash tax, borrowing, debt ndash required to run a national economy.But even then, as the tax expert Professor Richard Murphy has pointed out, it is absurd to claim, as GERS has in recent years, that Scotland with % of the UK population accounts for nearly % of the entire UK deficit. This just doesnt make sense. GERS crudely measures the taxes raised narrowly in Scotland and assigns a great heap of spending from all over the UK ndash like defence ndash onto the spending numbers. It is an arbitrary carve up, which can be challenged under international accounting conventions. But lets not bother with all that, because GERS is irrelevant for a much more important reason: pandemic economics.The catastrophe that is coronavirus has demonstrated how malleable and transitory debt and deficit figures really are. GERS is based on the discredited Thatcherite logic of the household budget. ldquoSpending what you can afford...balancing the budget...never a lender nor a borrower be. These are out-dated fiscal homilies, which have no bearing on how economies actually work, which is through issuing debt.You dont have to be a devotee of Modern Monetary Theoryto see that balanced budgets are a recipe not for economic strength and productivity, but often for economic stagnation and decline. John Maynard Keynes told us that much  years ago.Now even Boris Johnson has made debt the centrepiece of UK financial policy, justying prodigious borrowing on the basis of historically low interest rates. This is as near as we get to free money. The UK government can issue -year bonds locking in these evanescent interest rates, even making money out of being in debt. Central banks are now talking about negative interest rates.Of course, there are limits to this. If a government really did spend like there was no tomorrow, andthis spending did not generate economic activity, there would be inflation ndash possibly hyper-inflation as in Zimbabwe. But for an advanced economy, under current world conditions, this is a remote risk.So, evenScotland had this % independence deficit, ex-Covid. The answer has to be: so what  Countries are coping with much larger deficits. This is not Scottish exceptionalism or romantic nationalism. There is every reason to suppose that Scotland would perform better as an independent country than as a remote region of the UK. Look at small countries across Europe, from Slovakia to Norway, in and out of the EU. The idea that Scotland is uniquely cursed is not just offensive, it is economically illiterate.Debt is a bogus bogey man, always has been. But Covid has finally made this clear to everyone who looks at the national accounts. How could Boris Johnson be borrowing to invest when the UK deficit is heading into orbit and UK debt has just topped pound trillion  The European Union was the last redoubt of austerity economics, which was used brutally to impoverish Greece. But even Brussels has abandoned the Maastricht Stability Pact limiting debt to % of GDP.Actually, there is one final, final redoubt of austerity economics: the Scottish Labour Party. Having recently supported a leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who proposed the greatest borrowing and debt in economic history, it obediently applauds the scary logic of GERS every year ndash but only for Scottish viewers. If Labour wanted to make itself relevant again it would recognise that, in the real world, debt problems would largely vanish in the course of reconfiguring the UK after Scottish independence.Labour could seize the political moment by calling for a new union of equality. As this column has argued, the first act of an independent Scottish government would be to strike a new union with the rest of the UK to ensure economic continuity, free movement, common trading standards. Scotland is too wise to opt for autarky. In the process notional debts and deficits would be diminished as politics took over.The UK will want to be on good terms with an independent Scotland, not least because of the disruption that will follow Brexit. When Ireland became independent its nominal debt of % of GDP was negotiated away. Similarly, in Scotland there would be debt trade offs ndash such as leasing Faslane for  years, or as a quid pro quo for accepting most rUK trading deals with other countries. Debt is malleable because it is essentially political.The real lesson of GERS has always been this: there is no obvious way that Scotland can reverse its historic decline while remaining in the United Kingdom as it currently exists. This dependency culture can only get worse. Like unemployment benefit, Barnett bungs are no alternative to self-sustaining employment, to economic regeneration.GERS cheerleaders havent realised that the window of opportunity here is relatively narrow. Ideally, Scotland needs to become independent while interest rates remain at historically low levels to smooth the path to autonomy. Perhaps GERS should really stand for: get out while the going is good.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Game over.John Dunlop, Ayr.TO accept Peter Russellrsquos argument that the Vow was deliveredrequires a lack of awareness of the reality of the UKrsquos constitution, and in particular that the House of Commons is sovereign, possessing supreme or ultimate power. For instance, there is nothing to prevent the repeal of the Sections of the  Scotland Act which Mr Russell puts his faith in. Similarly, the Barnett Formula could be brought to an end by a vote in the House of Commons, and with  of  MPs at Westminster, there is little we could do about it.Ah, but they wouldnrsquot do this, comes the reply. They are bound by the Vow. But with UK indebtedness at something like pound trillion the temptation to cut spending in this way must be great for a Conservative Government with little support here already.With regard to ldquoextensive powers devolved, letrsquos suppose the powers were ldquoextensive as Mr Russell asserts. However, we already know Westminsterrsquos intentions with regard to the ldquoSingle British Market will mean Scottish food regulations can be undermined by the requirement of ldquomutual recognition. In any event, it would always be open to Westminster to legislate to amend regulations passed at Holyrood. As Enoch Powell said, ldquopower devolved is power retained, because it can always be taken back again.Thus to consider the Vow without consideration of the context within which it will operate, is, to put it at its best, limited. His reticence to do this is though easily understood.Lastly, Mr Russell disapproves of others ldquotelling lies, but the fact is his claimed Commission opinion about Scotlandrsquos membership position never existed, as this would only have been forthcoming to the political head of state of a member country. It might be interesting to learn why David Cameron never did get round to asking that question. Thus, Mr Russellrsquos claim that, had Scotland voted Yes, we would have left the EU on independence, is based on no more than the opinion of inidual Commissioners writing in a personal capacity.While Mr Russell may, as I do, deprecate anyone telling lies, his letter reveals a careful selection of the truth.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.CATRIONA Stewart thinks Douglas Ross ldquois right, we need to learn to disagree.

But the Scottish Government is currently not just in danger of being excessively secretive, but of making itself absurd through its refusal to provide the public with answers to basic questions.The question of when the First Minister first knew that people positive with coronavirus were being discharged into care homes is a matter of urgent public interest. It is not one that compromises the privacy of inidual patients or impinges on the Governmentrsquos ability to make the best decisions. Nor should it be one that requires her to obtain details from Public Health Scotland it is inconceivable that she does not know the answer. She is simply refusing to give it.The assumption must be that it is one that doesnrsquot show her and the Government in the best light. But the refusal to answer is worse than simply admitting as much. Scots are well aware that government is not infallible, and this Government in particular has been afforded a generous degree of latitude for its mistakes. In part, that may be due to the reasonable and realistic recognition of this fact that it presents in its rhetoric.That counts for nothing, however, when its responses ndash or refusals to respond ndash fail to correspond with those public statements. There has been an alarming pattern of behaviour on this front. To take just a few instances, there has been the Queen Elizabeth Hospital inquiry, the reluctance to publish minutes of ministerial meetings, delays to routine Freedom of Information requests, an attempt to sneak out an ICEA report critical of education policy, Audit Scotlandrsquos damning assessment of secrecy surrounding PFI projects, the disgraceful evasion over the role of government and public officials in the inquiry into Alex Salmond ndash after assurances that all such material would be forthcoming ndash and now the ludicrous claim that an effective reaction to the Covid emergency would be constrained by the answer to a simple question about when the Government knew what.All of these obfuscations give little reason for public confidence that an inquiry into coronavirus policy, when it finally comes, will uncover the full picture. The Government gives lip service to statements about how mistakes will undoubtedly have been made it makes glib pronouncements about how important it will be to identy them, and ensure that lessons are learnt so that they are not repeated.But the reality is that it goes to enormous s ndash and often, when the courts are involved, enormous cost to the public purse ndash to avoid answering such questions, far less admit its own failings. That is an unhealthy attitude, corrosive of public confidence and damaging to good governance.Whatrsquos more, given that the electorate is composed of grown-ups and, on current showings, far from censorious, it is a politically foolish and counterproductive one. There are relatively few legitimate reasons, generally to do with security concerns or momentous economic decisions likely to move markets, for government business to be conducted privately. Potential embarrassment to the SNP is not one.The expectation should be that frank disclosure is the norm it benefits the Government by making them seem like fair dealers, it improves policy decisions for the future and, above all, it is a reminder that the public has a right to know, and that politicians should be the peoplersquos servants, rather than the reverse."},{"url":null,"title":"climate-professor-calls-ban-road-expansion-plans-scotland","story":"Edinburgh University professor Dave Reay has also warned that mirroring the path of the  financial crash recovery ldquowill waste money.The expert has stressed that ldquoaligning skills, training and job creation with a green recovery is vital in terms of buffering the impacts of Covid but has warned that ldquofinance will inevitably be a major barrier to delivering any sort of recovery, green on otherwise.:Oil and gas chiefs in plea for funds to meet  lsquonet zerorsquo promise as , jobs remain at riskThe Scottish Government has committed to dualling the A from Perth to Inverness in a pound billion project, while the pound billion Edinburgh City Region Deal, made up of UK and Scottish government funding, includes plans to overhaul the Sherfhall roundabout on the A city bypass.The Scottish Governmentrsquos next phase of infrastructure proposals will prioritise a green recovery from the Covid- crisis.Professor Reay said: ldquoIf we repeat the mistakes of  and simply invest with a view to ato business as usual, we will waste money and any recovery will not be a sustainable one.ldquoThe transition to net zero already required major changes in sectors such as energy, transport, built environment and agriculture.

We know that Scotland will experience more severe weather in the years ahead, so investment should be prioritised in climate-proofing existing infrastructure, rather than on huge road expansion plans.ldquoInvestment in new projects must support local economies and public transport. Dualling and electrying the Highland mainline from Perth to Inverness, which co-incidentally runs roughly parallel to the A, would not only make rail a much more convenient option for many passengers, but it would also make the A much safer by providing the opportunity to remove a signicant volume of freight from the road too.The Scottish Government said that road building and maintenance contributes pound. billion to the economy and supports , jobs.

Hopefully, he will be back involved soon.McBurnie, who briefly became this countryrsquos most expensive footballer when he moved from Swansea to Sheffield United in a poundm deal last year, has done so successfully at club level in the past as well.But bringing in another rugged forward who, while not being a prolic scorer, excels in those areas is a positive development.Queens great Stephen Dobbie benefitted, albeit in the second tier, greatly from his partnership with Dykes two seasons ago. \"I scored  goals, he said. \"Lyndon adapted his game well for dferent roles. His strengths are winning headers. His long stride and pace means he gets away from players too.\"Having the striker, who gave the Celtic and Rangers rearguards some distinctly uncomfortable afternoons last season, at his disposal will give Clarke the option to change both his formation and tactics, to switch to a Plan B, to go long should the occasion demand it.

The prospect of Scotland having such a combative inidual leading the line once again is an enticing one.

Instead, the issues have cross-fertilised. Trust, a most valuable resource in an era defined by alienation from political institutions, has been placed with more confidence in the Scottish Government than it has with a mendacious group of Tories who ndash yet again ndash are in government without the democratic approval of the Scottish electorate.In truth, rising support for independence is being driven by Westminster and an ailing British state. A cocktail of issues have come together to produce a now toxic liquor. Years of ruinous austerity ndash and downright cruelty pursued through a slew of punitive initiatives like the bedroom tax ndash have cemented a deeply felt sense of injustice. The fact that Scotland voted to Remain in the European Union, has stretched the democratic deficit to breaking point, while the centring of British nationalism and xenophobia has disaffected many who voted No in .:New Glasgow Labour leader named after upset winThe General Election result of  too, has served to reinforce the idea that change through Westminster is an impossibility. And Boris Johnson, a man so widely reviled in Scotland that his mere presence serves as a priceless campaign tool for independence activists, personies the trouble the Union is in.But despite this apparently inevitable march towards independence, supporters should cast a discerning eye over the SNP leadership and push for a revamped independence case that is fit for the post-Coronavirus world. This is especially important as the present prospectus in the form of the Growth Commission ndash whose chairman has argued for the lsquosoftest possiblersquo form of independence ndash has been so exposed by events.For example, the commission argues for Sterlingisation as a means to \"transition\" towards an independent currency. In truth, it is a straightjacket, bound by economic tests that would allow UK financial institutions to prevent Scotland establishing its own central bank all but indefinitely. Had this come to pass, Scotland would have been unable to furlough workers, and would not have been able to issue government bonds. Yet this catastrophic outcome is swept under the carpet, rather than being recognised and corrected. Already years, which could have been spent bedding in the idea of a Scottish currency into the society, have been wasted.There is further confusion. The SNP has prioritised opposition to Brexit to the extent that independence has become intertwined with EU membership. To be clear, the strategic value of this can be debated. Many would point to recent polling as a vindication of this approach. But what is particularly awkward is this has been so vigorously pursued at the same time as adopting a currency position that would actively prohibit entry to the EU. In short: it would not be possible to pursue Sterlinigisation with post-Brexit UK, and become an EU member.Perhaps the surging polls help to assuage doubts about the coherence of the independence case among supporters. But be in no doubt, these issues are easy pickings for those who support the Union in a campaign setting. It would be folly to continue to argue for positions that are so easily unravelled. New times require a new approach ndash and time is of the essence. The longer the preication over these big questions, the more entrenched they become.:Labour calls for out of date hate crime figures to be updated amid controversial proposalsWhat is urgently needed is a clear plan that can transform our economy, society and democracy. The independence movement should avoid complacency when demanding this of its leaders. When Nicola Sturgeon responds to Andrew Marr on the question of an independence referendum by saying, \"as long as I need to be focusing on the coronavirus crisis and the economic legacy of that crisis that will have my  percent focus\", that should prick up ears. Not only will the economic legacy of the pandemic go on indefinitely, but it is precisely because of the challenge that lies ahead that we require the full powers of independence.At this time, the SNP leadership lacks a strategy that can secure genuine independence and transform society from the devastation left by the virus and a decade of Tory austerity. A plan that can galvanise the movement, inspire the population, deliver independence and transform Scotland is required.

He set up a Facebook forum which has become an inspiring and supportive community for budding interior designers and a place to share tips, advice, laugh at disasters and help people try to avoid them.ldquoGoing into lockdown I think, like many people, I wondered how we were going to get through this, said Amabile. ldquoI am lucky I had my garden and studio to retreat to rather than just stare at four walls. I wanted to do a project to keep me sane and I think people saw their house and home and wondered what they could do themselves. Changing things in their homes took on a therapeutic element and was a way of keeping busy and I ended up changing my kitchen.For Amabile, lockdown saw him consider his approach to design dferently and went back to grass roots. His design firm, which has a Glasgow base, is associated with high end design. One of their recent projects was as interior design partner for the Ambassador Homes exclusive Park Quadrant development.He added: ldquoI have done a lot of work on TV shows with all the frills when you have been up against the clock and I just thought how fresh it would be to have some kind of forum where you could band ideas about and to help one another.ldquoI wanted to be able to really talk to the people who have watched the TV shows over the years. I have never had a shop, although I have a design service. People may have watched -minute Makeover and then go on the ITV website to find out more about what they can order or buy.ldquoHowever creating a forum was an opportunity for me to give back to people so our Sunday live sessions, which I call lsquovirtual hugs from my snugrsquo were born on #Amabilehomehaven on Facebook. It has been so enjoyable to do and it is great when all the questions come through. People put up pictures and I post projects and room ideas and I think everyone just likes a good nosy and I like to see what people are doing. People have been engaging which has been great and even answering their home questions. We have seen a lot of before and after pictures and people have been very proud of what they have achieved.ldquoIt has been really heart-warming and it is nice to know we were all in the same boat in lockdown. It doesnrsquot matterI have been dressing luxury show homes or designing for famous people, I think that design is for everyone.ldquoIt is all about getting the look. Everyone might want a Chanel handbag, but canrsquot afford it, so it is about looking at what you can do with a budget and adding the little zingy things to make a dference. I used to come home from school and my mum would have rearranged the house again.

Sadly for Janey I donrsquot think Irsquoll be needing an apprentice any time soon.While most lockdown restrictions are beginning to ease, Amabile wants to keep the forum going in some way while looking to develop his business in unprecedented times. He is hoping to develop online consultations and develop his successful room in a box idea.He added: ldquoI am looking at ways of doing things dferently. One is a simple way of helping people with a room in a box. You set your budget from a bronze, silver or gold box and I have chosen items to go in it with the running about all done for you.ldquoAnother step would be to offer online design consultations through my website. It was something I had been thinking about before lockdown, and now seems like the appropriate time do to something like this.It is not the only ambition Amabile has to expand as he is looking to start what would initially be an online design school helping people to take on their own projects.He added: ldquoDuring the forums I have been taking notes on all the questions asked to see what people are interested in doing or trying and I would like to develop this into a design school. It seems to be he next stage and would help people get to the next step in design without any mystery or magic to help them have a good home.ldquoFrom the comfort of their home they could download kits from design theories to colour wheels to create their own style.And while many people are logging on to Amabilersquos facebook forum on a Sunday morning, many fans can still get their -minute Makeover fix on TV reruns.ldquoI did loved doing the show and the most important thing for me was meeting the family and getting it right for them, added Amabile. ldquoI could have jumped about the UK and designed homes based on what I liked, but it was about getting it right for the person.For more information go to: www.youtube johnamabiledesign, www.facebook johnamabiledesign or www.facebook groups amabilehomehaven"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-mark-smith-scotland-know-dying-need-accept","story":"I mention them because Irsquove been imagining what they might be saying about the current state of politicsthey were still around.

First, they were cautious about spending money unnecessarily. Second, they were wary of change and had generally conservative instincts. Third, they were resistant to governments telling them what to do . And fourth, they had a dual identity that they pretty much took for granted: their Scottishness was their Britishness was their Scottishness.:Opinion: Mark Smith: In defence of Sarah Smith hellip and a plea to the First MinisterAll of these instincts ndash formed and confirmed by the war, and post-war governmentsndash led both Anne and Rob to be deeply suspicious of Scottish nationalism and the people who led it: first Alex Salmond, then Nicola Sturgeon. Salmond, as far as they were concerned, was a blowhard and Sturgeon a troublemaker and a stirrer. In later years, Anne would sit back in her chair after wersquod finished our cups of tea and cakeand say: ldquoSo, tell me, what has that besom been up to now I realise not all of you may feel quite as affectionate about Scots like Anne and Rob as I do: indeed, some of the nastier nationalists on Twitter take great delight in the fact that Scots of Anne and Robrsquos generationare dying out. But, as the law of demographics adjusts the population without pity, and there are fewer Scots like Anne and Rob and more Scots who take dferent views, I canrsquot help feeling a bit down dispirited depressed. The Scotland I know, through people like Anne and Rob, my grannies, my mother, is dying. And I need to accept it.A couple of recent trends have confirmed where things seem to be going. Scots like Anne and Rob were generally thrty ndash my granny in Thurso used to give us felt-tip pens to colour in the bald patches on her rugs so she didnrsquot have to buy new ones ndash and much of their antipathy to Scottish independence came from the realisation that it would be expensive for Scots like them. They would be worse off.However, increasingly, many Scots take a dferent, and more cavalier, view of money. A lot of them have credit cards and overdraftsand the idea of debt, and the cost of debt, is not off-putting to them, which explains why the economic cost of independence is no deterrent. They shrug their shoulders. So what  A Panelbase poll the other day showed that  per cent of Scots believe independence will be good for the Scottish economy.Anne and Robrsquos instinctive caution and suspicion about politicians, especially politicians telling you what to do, is also clearly under threat. Many Scots listen to Nicola Sturgeonrsquos briefings obediently rather than questioningly they are more likely than people in the rest of the UK to wear face masks and to do it zealously, belligerently even they also bristle at criticism of the First Minister. Scots like Anne and Rob may have been conservative, but they werenrsquot conformist. What happened to our antipathy to authority  Itrsquos one of the things I liked about us most.:Opinion: Mark Smith: The leaked SNP email that shows why Nicola Sturgeon is doing so wellAnne and Robrsquos dual British Scottish identity is also on the way out. I was chatting to a retired coal miner the other day ndash hersquos in his s ndash and it was interesting to see his take on the world. He was passionately anti-Thatcher and is passionately Royalist he is instinctively Scottish and instinctively British. Some nationalists would see those positions as contradictory but theyrsquore not. A lot of Scots feel that way. The problem is a lot of them are in their s and s and wonrsquot be around for much longer.I have to admit that fact does get me down. I accept there are lots of older Scots who support independence . But it seems to me that, as more of the post-war generation dies out, the more we lose the voices of caution and conservatism. Younger Scots are always going to be a bit more relaxed about risk ndash thatrsquos natural ndash but we are losing the Scots who look at the idea of change, and the cost of it, and say: ca canny.The only hope is that some younger voters wonrsquot always be the same as they are now and that, as they get older, their views will moderate and change. Who knows, they may even start to understand the value of Anne and Robrsquos approach to spending money, and to politicians and nationalistic politicians in particular. It sometimes happens as you get older: you see more.But I am not hopeful. Increasingly, when I speak to people under , they feel uncomfortably dferent to many of the Scots I know, and the effect is even more marked when you speak to people under . They are aggressively supportive of Nicola Sturgeon and aggressively attached to Scottishness. They are dismissive of the risks of independence and the benefits of being in a union. I do not like any of this. I think it is a mark of nationalist ideology. I would prefer itmore people thought like Anne and Rob, and my granny, and me.

He set up a facebook forum which has become an inspiring and supportive community for budding interior designers and a place to share tips, advice, laugh at disasters and help people try to avoid them.ldquoGoing into lockdown I think, like many people, I wondered how we were going to get through this, said Amabile. ldquoI am lucky I had my garden and studio to retreat to rather than just stare at four walls. I wanted to do a project to keep me sane and I think people saw their house and home and wondered what they could do themselves. Changing things in their homes took on a therapeutic element and was a way of keeping busy and I ended up changing my kitchen.Read more: Murder victim Moira Jones family share treasured pictures of her happy childhood memoriesFor Amabile lockdown saw him consider his approach to design dferently and went back to grass roots. His design firm, which has a Glasgow base, is associated with high end design. One of their recent projects was as interior design partner for the Ambassador Homes exclusive Park Quadrant development.He added: ldquoI have done a lot of work on TV shows with all the frills when you have been up against the clock and I just thought how fresh it would be to have some kind of forum where you could band ideas about and to help one another.ldquoI wanted to be able to really talk to the people who have watched the TV shows over the years. I have never had a shop, although I have a design service. People may have watched -minute Makeover and then go on the ITV website to find out more about what they can order or buy.ldquoHowever creating a forum was an opportunity for me to give back to people so our Sunday live sessions, which I call virtual hugs from my snug were born on #Amabilehomehaven on facebook. It has been so enjoyable to do and it is great when all the questions come through. People put up pictures and I post projects and room ideas and I think everyone just likes a good nosy and I like to see what people are doing. People have been engaging which has been great and even answering their home questions. We have seen a lot of before and after pictures and people have been very proud of what they have achieved.ldquoIt has been really heart-warming and it is nice to know we were all in the same boat in lockdown. It doesnrsquot matterI have been dressing luxury show homes or designing for famous people, I think that design is for everyone.ldquoIt is all about getting the look. Everyone might want a Chanel handbag, but canrsquot afford it, so it is about looking at what you can do with a budget and adding the little zingy things to make a dference. I used to come home from school and my mum would have rearranged the house again. The living room would be a bedroom and I think that is where I got my start as well as I would be rearranging my brother and Irsquos bunk beds.ldquoI donrsquot think design is about keeping up with the Jonesrsquo anymore, I think people just want to make the best of what they have.Read more: See inside Instagram hit and Scotlands answer to Mrs Hinch Cheryl Johnstons transformed homeOne guest designer who has posted on his page is Scots comedian Janey Godley.

Sadly for Janey I donrsquot think Irsquoll be needing an apprentice any time soon.While most lockdown restrictions are beginning to ease, Amabile wants to keep the forum going in some way while looking to develop his business in unprecedented times. He is hoping to develop online consultations and develop his successful room in a box idea.He added: ldquoI am looking at ways of doing things dferently. One is a simple way of helping people with a room in a box. You set your budget from a bronze, silver or gold box and I have chosen items to go in it with the running about all done for you.ldquoAnother step would be to offer online design consultations through my website. It was something I had been thinking about before lockdown, and now seems like the appropriate time do to something like this.It is not the only ambition Amabile has to expand as he is looking to start what would initially be an online design school helping people to take on their own projects.He added: ldquoDuring the forums I have been taking notes on all the questions asked to see what people are interested in doing or trying and I would like to develop this into a design school. It seems to be he next stage and would help people get to the next step in design without any mystery or magic to help them have a good home.ldquoFrom the comfort of their home they could download kits from design theories to colour wheels to create their own style.And while many people are logging on to Amabilersquos facebook forum on a Sunday morning, many fans can still get their -minute Makeover fix on TV reruns.ldquoI did loved doing the show and the most important thing for me was meeting the family and getting it right for them, added Amabile. ldquoI could have jumped about the UK

The infrastructure proposals have been designed to enable Orkney to manage a transition away from fossil fuels, while continuing to generate social and economic benefit from ongoing oil and gas activity.The proposals will have #transformational# impact on Orkney#s economy and society. As well as creating as many  new jobs, there will also be a substantial number of job opportunities during the construction phase.OIC leader James Stockan said: “Our vision is to build a truly sustainable business that is a core economic asset for Orkney, but also a first phase in enabling a scale of investment and logistical capability for the UK, which will be of international signicance.“Prime Minister Boris Johnson clearly welcomed our ambition and Orkney’s potential during his recent visit to our islands, describing as a ‘fantastic idea’ our vision for Orkney as a low-carbon, zero-emissions hub of innovation, with Scapa Flow at its heart.“We believe the time is right to maximise the incredible natural assets and geography of Scapa Flow and Orkney, to ensure a long-term sustainable future for our communities. We are open for business now, and ready to work with potential investors and operators to develop the signicant strategic and international opportunities Scapa Flow offers.“The Scapa Deep Water Quay proposal has been included in the Islands Deal list of projects that has received funding commitment from the Scottish and UK governments, and we are continuing to ensure that the funding earmarked for this will be secured.”Central to the project is the unique geographical advantage of Scapa Flow, described by the council as the largest natural deep-water harbour in the northern hemisphere, as the potential setting for internationally signicant marine logistics to serve the new and emerging sectors, including low-carbon fuel transition and offshore wind developments.Scapa Deep Water Quay is seen as the optimal location for construction and operations and maintenance activities, associated with offshore wind, as well as for a liquefied natural gasstorage and distribution hub. At the same time, this infrastructure has the capability to accommodate semi-submersible s of all types, giving Orkney a unique UK competitive edge within the existing oil and gas market.The project team believes it could be delivered by . Other proposals, such as Hatston and Kirkwall, could take three or four years to deliver.Phase two will ultimately develop the islands’ smaller harbours and piers across the islands.Harbour users and key stakeholders were consulted from the outset, to help gain an understanding of the issues, constraints and opportunities associated with harbour infrastructure around Orkney, through workshops and interviews. The range of stakeholders includes local communities, harbour users, potential funders and environmental bodies such as Scottish Natural Heritage.Harbourmaster James Buck added: “Tackling decarbonisation is the strand that binds these proposals together, providing infrastructure and knowledge for renewable energy developments around our waters will allow us to reach climate change targets. “We will also look at the potential for net environmental gain through habitat reinstatement and enhancement.”According to the OIC, Orkney Harbours is one of the most erse and successful council-run port authorities in the UK, with an annual turnover of £ million and nearly , annual vessel movements.The council added that the exact timing of construction for each of the phase one masterplan proposals is not yet known.This will be determined over the next six to  months, and will depend on a range of factors including market requirements, funding and environmental considerations.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.jpg","title":"royal celtic societys unique music","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWork has begun on processing the twenty entries received for a unique competition which set the country’s musicians the challenge of creating a new shinty composition.

The midwives though very kind didn’t alleviate any of my fears - but how could they  “They had no frame of reference, just a memory of the last woman who had a baby with Down syndrome and left with the myriad of leaflets.”Clare remains determined that no mother and family who have a baby with Down syndrome will leavehospital feeling as she did.“I have to leave the boxes in the maternity units and the midwives ask the mothershe wants one.

According to the Royal College of Nursing, there are an estimated , registered nursing vacancies in the NHS. The union says this figure could rise even further during .Read More Up to , could die in Northern Ireland coronavirus second wave, leaked document claimsBrian Morton, RCN Northern Ireland associate director, told the Belfast : With around , unfilled nursing posts in the health and social care service, the pressures in the system heading into the winter months are increasingly unsustainable. Earlier this year, and following industrial action by RCN members and members of other unions, the Northern Ireland Executive published a safe nurse staffing framework. When fully implemented, the framework will help signicantly to address nursing shortages but this will take time. It is essential, meanwhile, that we support the recruitment and retention of nursing staff by making sure that they are paid fairly and recognised for their outstanding contribution to the health and well-being of the people of Northern Ireland. SDLP health spokesman Colin McGrath says workforce planning is in dire need of being addressed.One of the major side effects of a workforce shortage is the additional pressures that it puts on the current staff, who are having to bridge the gap by working extra shts to make up for missing team members, the South Down MLA said.With the added demands on the current system with Covid- and long waiting lists, it#s almost like a perfect storm.Addressing this in the middle of a pandemic is not easy but it#s certainly something I#d like to think the Department of Health is giving major consideration.In a statement, a spokesperson for Health Minister Robin Swann said: The Department is taking a range of actions to reduce vacancies, both in the short term, for example, international nursing recruitment, and in the longer term, including implementation of the Workforce Strategy which was published in May , increased training commissioning, and efforts to ensure that the HSC is an employer of choice.

Then I came back home and was playing for Ards. I had a few injuries and then I ended up playing another two games after that.I#ve no actual shots of me on my own for those matches. There are a couple of team photos around and that#s it. I have looked about and even searched on dferent sites online, but I can#t seem to get any.While modern day international matches are beamed across the world with endless images available on demand, Paul admitted it showed the stark change in the times between the current football landscape in the digital age compared to back in his day.Now you only have to click your fingers and you can get as many photos as you want, he added.Then it was dferent, there were far less cameras around during the matches. I have actually spoken to a few of the photographers who used to do photos around the time, but even they didn#t have any.It#s really mad that there isn#t any about, especially when you look back and there are photos of other players from those years. It is just strange.I wouldn#t say I was particularly disappointed to be fair. I#m not one really for photographs personally, but it was just whenever the artist wanted a photograph and now we can#t find one, that#s when I just started thinking.Describing his time playing for Northern Ireland and representing the country on the world stage as every boy#s dream, Paul explained he only has fantastic memories of playing against the likes of Norway, Yugoslavia and the Republic of Ireland.You would think with the likes of matches against Norway, Denmark and the Republic of Ireland at home there would be more photos knocking about, he said.I joke that the reason why they can#t get an action shot of me is because my positioning was so good and I never had to do any ing. That#s what I#m saying anyway.Anyone who manages to uncover any photographs they may have of Paul in action during a match should contact Dundonald FC.

Bád Eddiehas become an iconic structure on the beach since it came ashore at Magheraclogher Strand, Bunbeg, for minor repairs in .A local ship builder carried out the repairs needed to some planks after it came aground but the engine was never replaced and the boat has remained there for decades, becoming part of the landscape.The fishing boat is a popular tourist attraction while locals also pose beside it for weddings, communion and even christening photographs.It has featured in Vogue magazine as well as in music videos by Clannad and U.However, Bád Eddie, built in the western French region of Brittany, has fallen into serious disrepair over the last  years and is in danger of disintegrating completely.Its future has now been taken up by a local committee who hope to preserve and design a replica structure to replace it to keep tourism alive.The committee launched its campaign with a concert at the wreck featuring some of Donegal#s best-known musicians including Clannad singer Moya Brennan and Altan#s Mairead Ni Mhaonaigh while a Gofundme page has raised over €,.The organisers have appealed for help far and wide - including to the Donegal diaspora abroad - and when it is safe to do so, they plan to hold an auction of paintings of the boat, promised to them by many prominent artists including Co Fermanagh-based Michelle Duffy.Michelle, who runs Garrison-based studio #Camlake Canvas, said: I love this place and it has inspired a lot of my art works over the years. I#ve been trying to think of ways that I can help so I will be donating all the profits from any sales of my pieces to the fundraising.A team from the Northern Ireland Technology Centre, based at Queen#s University, is due in the area later this week to create D images which will help with designing a second, permanent structure.Anne Marie Ferry, a member of the committee, said the boat is vital to the future of tourism in the area: We have to preserve this boat becauseit falls apart there will be nobody coming back to visit this area.If it goes then there#s nothing left in Gaoth Dobhair.Belfast Most ReadSinn Fein members met #MI spy# in loyalist heartlandJohnny Adair convinced #MI agent# Dennis McFadden foiled his murder as New IRA hunt second spy in ranksIvan LittleOpinionTime for Sinn Fein to show Martina Anderson the doorSecret#s out... pundit lets slip Rory and Erica McIlroy are expecting a baby girl #any day now#Terrorist who allowed Newry home to be used for IRA plotting dies suddenly,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is not the first time he faced a challenge in that part of Ulster. He tells Liam Tunney his gripping story, outlining his reasons for wanting to break the stigma of addictionA County Derry man has spoken of his experience with addiction as he prepares for a fundraising challenge in aid of the organisation who helped him deal with it. Dean Groogan, from Ballinascreen, is raising money for the Cuan Mhuire rehabilitation centre in Newry by climbing the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains this weekend with a number of friends. The -year-old, well-known in south Derry for his story-telling and recitation talent, has spoken about his story to encourage others who may be struggling to seek the help they need. “I know a lot of people that need help, but they dont know where to get it or how to go about it,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I wasnt originally going to talk about myself, but I was talking to my girlfriend and people close to me and they said, why are you beating about the bush  “They saidI wanted to break the stigma, I had to be straight and honest, and it made sense. The more I tell my story, itll help people come forward and get help themselves.” Dean had been struggling with drug addiction for a number of years before attending the Newry rehabilitation centre, and says the continued fight to cover up his problems took its toll. “For a lot of years I was struggling. I can make all the excuses in the world about mental health problems, anxiety, depression and guilt, but I got deep into addiction with fake highs,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “I was covering up for a lot of years. I can wear a hundred and one masks and people would think I was in great form, but deep down I was a broken person. “I was hiding that for a long time and I tried a thousand times to get myself sorted, but I would not do it on my own. “It was put to me a few times about getting residential help, but I didnt want it, because it was a pride thing for me. I was embarrassed people would find out. “Eventually I had to put my hands up and say I needed help. I didnt lose my job or my family, so it wasnt rock bottom that way, but emotionally, I was at rock bottom. “I didnt know where to go, I was just a broken person in the depths of depression. Just a broken man. I had to get help and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” Dean and Pat McGinn met up a few weeks ago to record a video about Cuan Mhuire. Dean was introduced to Pat McGinn, a former Lord Mayor of Newry and someone who had been through Cuan Mhuire previously. He admits though, thatit wasnt for the intervention of his girlfriend Emma, and close family and friends, he might not have taken that step. “Cuan Mhuire saved my le, andit hadnt been for my girlfriend Emma and my close family and friends, I wouldnt have gone,” he said. “I wont say Cuan Mhuire did it all for me, because they dont just put a magic wand over your head and say thats you free, because you have to put in the work yourself. “I went in and gave it my all and Cuan Mhuire gave me three months to get my head sorted, myself straight, allowed me to recharge the batteries and I came out a dferent man.” Cuan Mhuire was set up in  by Sister Consilio in Athy, County Kildare. The Newry centre was built in  and originally catered for those suffering from alcohol addiction. These days, the spectrum of addiction is much wider. “In this day and age, its not as simple as a man lying drunk in the street. Drugs are everywhere, in every bar you go into, and its so easy for a young person to get hooked on something,” said Dean. “They try it for a bit of craic and the next thing they know, its a few months down the line and theyre in something they cant get out of. It destroys lives. “Drugs are a new thing, people dont really understand. I was speaking to a man who was drinking for years. He said he never touched drugs, butthey had been about in his day he probably would have. “Its so easily available these days and it wrecks families. It rips the soul clean out of you. For me, I detested myself. I knew what I was doing was wrong and that it was wrecking my le. “I just couldnt stop. Addiction is something that you cant get enough of, but that you detest. It was just ruining me and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” The Cuan Mhuire centre in Newry. On Saturday, August , Dean and a group of friends will climb the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains to raise money for the centre. They are already well on the way to their pound, target, and are hoping the trip will be a fun way of raising money and awareness for Cuan Mhuire. “Eight of us are going to start off at six in the morning and tackle the highest peaks in the Mournes,” said the Ballinascreen native. “I know a few boys that have done it in around  or  hours, but were not going to break any records! There are a few men going to meet us halfway up and do us a barbeque, so itll be a days craic as well. “I know money donated to the charity is great, but stigma is the main thing, so Ill be pushing online about the residential care for people suffering with drugs, gambling or drink.” Dean wants to ensure that anyone who finds themselves in need of help knows where to access it, and is especially keen to help men who may be struggling and reluctant to act. “As men, we bottle a lot of things up, personal things like depression or anxiety and people turn to drink or drugs or other highs to mask them things,” he said. “They are taught from no age not to show any emotions, to bottle it up and be a man, and thats not the reality. Theyre turning to other substances to mask the pain and thats just not the way to go. “This is to let them know that places like Cuan Mhuire are out there and will help themthey come forward. “Anything can go through that door thats one thing I found out about it. There are all dferent age groups and all dferent backgrounds and religions. “There are people with plenty of money and people with none. There were even a few people who were homeless whose families want nothing to do with them. “Addiction doesnt care who you are, it will come for you regardless. Putting yourself out there warts and all isnt easy, butit helps someone, thats the reason for doing it.” For more information, visit the Mourne Mountain Challenge Facebook page, where you can find links to the Just Giving page, for those wishing to donate.

The colleges smart new unorm includes a blazer and jumper piped in gold which can be worn with a skirt or trousers. School principal, Martine Mulhern, said the new look came about after pupils said they wanted to be able to decide which they wanted to wear. A lot of the girls prefer to wear a skirt, but they said other pupils should have the choicethey want to wear trousers, she said. The whole idea of respecting other peoples choices is very important. googletag.cmd.push Last year the school council surveyed the pupils who voted overwhelmingly in favour of introducing a trouser option. This led to a long process of designing the new unorm, with the pupils allowed their say in how it should look and feel. The conversation started with Hunters Apparel in Derry who gave us dferent designs and that solid groundwork allowed us to get to the place where we are today, said Mrs Mulhern. The girls were so mature and insightful throughout it all. They knew and understood that there were certain things we couldnt do, but it was so important they felt comfortable. googletag.cmd.push There were a few prototypes before we got to the finished designs, but everyone is delighted with them. They are all loving the new blazer because its very smart and really brightens things up, and a surprising number of them have decided to take the option of wearing trousers. StCecilias worked closely with local unorm suppliers Max Fashions and Select Kidz to keep the cost of the new unorm, which has been adopted by the new intake, down. There will be a gradual phasing out of the old unorm over the coming years. The girls are loving the new unorm and as a school community we are so proud of them for taking the lead, added Mrs Mulhern. The children always come first and we have to listen to them. It was the right thing to do.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The colleges smart new unorm includes a blazer and jumper piped in gold which can be worn with a skirt or trousers. School principal, Martine Mulhern, said the new look came about after pupils said they wanted to be able to decide which they wanted to wear. A lot of the girls prefer to wear a skirt, but they said other pupils should have the choicethey want to wear trousers, she said. The whole idea of respecting other peoples choices is very important. googletag.cmd.push Last year the school council surveyed the pupils who voted overwhelmingly in favour of introducing a trouser option. This led to a long process of designing the new unorm, with the pupils allowed their say in how it should look and feel. The conversation started with Hunters Apparel in Derry who gave us dferent designs and that solid groundwork allowed us to get to the place where we are today, said Mrs Mulhern. The girls were so mature and insightful throughout it all. They knew and understood that there were certain things we couldnt do, but it was so important they felt comfortable. googletag.cmd.push There were a few prototypes before we got to the finished designs, but everyone is delighted with them. They are all loving the new blazer because its very smart and really brightens things up, and a surprising number of them have decided to take the option of wearing trousers. StCecilias worked closely with local unorm suppliers Max Fashions and Select Kidz to keep the cost of the new unorm, which has been adopted by the new intake, down. There will be a gradual phasing out of the old unorm over the coming years. The girls are loving the new unorm and as a school community we are so proud of them for taking the lead, added Mrs Mulhern. The children always come first and we have to listen to them. It was the right thing to do.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Micky Doherty was presented with the Foyle Pride Mark Ashton Award for Outstanding Contribution to the LGBTQ+ community by the citys real Mayor, SDLP Councillor Brian Tierney, at a ceremony at the Holywell Trusts Garden of Remembrance on Saturday night. A spokesperson for Foyle Pride said Mr Doherty, who fronts the citys Pride parade each year, was a truly deserving winner who does so much, for not only the LGBTQ+ community, but also the wider city and district community. Mr Doherty is a tireless charity fundraiser and helped set up a special fund to help local people in need during the oronavirus crisis. googletag.cmd.push Im known in the local area as being a charity fundraiser-theres a charity fundraiser Ill host it, said Mr Doherty. Its just part of me that I like helping people. During lockdown I knew people had started to struggle and they were coming to me and I started to think about how I could help. Because I have been working with charities for a long time people put their trust in me. Mr Doherty was hosting a drive through bingo event last week when he got a phone call to say he had won the Foyle Pride award. I just burst out crying, he admitted. I really didnt expect it so I was just overwhelmed. googletag.cmd.push I just have so much gratitude for the award and for everyone who nominated me and I want to thank them all. Mr Doherty said he wished his late mum, Cathy, could have been there on Saturday to see him receive his award. Its hard to accept that my mammy couldnt be there, he said. Its just not the same without her but I am still filled with so much gratitude for it, he said. Derry LGBT+ campaigner, Suzanna Toland, who passed away earlier this year, was remembered at Saturdays ceremony. It was really nice to see Suzanna recognised for everything that she did, said Micky. She was a very special person.Before she passed away she had set up an LGBT+ disco at Rosie Joes so that people would have a safe place to socialise.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The guidance, announced this evening by Peter Weir, comes into effect from August . The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. googletag.cmd.push ”This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. “It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. “In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. googletag.cmd.push “In relationto communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible.  “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. “However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. “Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir added: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school. Parents should not send their children to schoolthey have any of the Covid- symptoms including: a high temperaturea new, continuous cougha loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mrs Patricia Herron, Music Co-ordinator at St Eoghans Primary School, Draperstown, has watched Daras talent grow and develop from an early age. “He was maybe P or P when I realised that there might be a little voice in there that needs to be heard,” she told the County Derry Post. “The routine in our school would be that I askany children want to have a go at auditioning for a solo piece, so Dara would come up to the piano and this beautul, soft, quiet voice would come out. googletag.cmd.push “He sang solo at ious religious ceremonies as well, but it was really towards the end of P when his voice was developing so much more. “He was using a lot of ornamentation and trills and it came to light when he was singing an Irish song, with the traditional voice.” It was while singing an Irish song at his primary school show that the wider community began to take notice of the -year-olds phenomenal talent. Patricia recalled the moment his mum, Donna, was overcome with emotion watching her son hold an audience spellbound. “At that concert, when Dara sang the Irish song, I was sitting behind Donna,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “He hadnt sang it for his mammy purposely, and Donna just turned around and looked at me, and I looked at her, and there were tears in her eyes. I just nodded asto say, I told you so.” In a nod to the community ethos in Ballinascreen, Mrs Herron said the fact Dara is so grounded and kind is testament to his upbringing. “He is such a lovely young man, so mannerly and kind. Even when I watch him on The Voice, hes always worried about everybody ,” she said. Pupils and staff at his former primary school, St Eoghans, beside a poster in support of Dara McNicholl “His voice is an absolute gt, and a gt that he must share with the world, because anybody Ive spoken to just wishes him so much luck. “Behind that is a lovely young man, and we wish him all the best. Hes very grounded and so are his family.” Daras exploits in The Voice Kids competition have enthused pupils and staff alike at a school where they take performance and the wholistic view of the child seriously. “In St Eoghans, we place a lot of importance on performing, and getting to know childrens talents, discover what they are and develop them,” said Mrs Herron. “Some schools think nowadays that concerts and opportunities to perform take away from learning time, but that is when you learn things like resilience, self-confidence and self-esteem. “The children from this area seem to be very musical and its an important part of our school, but Dara is such an inspiration. “From Primary  right up to Pimary , and indeed the staff, they just want to be like Dara. Any chance to sing now in school, Ill have a line of about a hundred children waiting to audition for a solo part!” After securing his place in the final with a beautul rendition of Sineacutead OConnors Nothing Compares  U on Saturday, Dara will take on fellow contestants George Elliott, Victoria Alsina and Justine Afante in the final. Coach Paloma Faith described his voice at the weekend as one of pure beauty and his primary school music teacher agrees. “To see a young child come in in P, get to be such an amazing singer by the time he leaves school, and then to excel and develop, I just cant wait to see what the future holds for him,” she said. “I heard him in an interview, and one of the lines he used was, I just want people to listen to my voice. “Now people have heard it and theyre sitting up, waiting to hear what comes next.” You can watch Dara in the final of the The Voice Kids this Saturday, August , at .pm on ITV.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is understood that the mystery vessel was bought for pound with the unknown owner planning to convert it into an Airbnb boat.  Foyle Search and Rescue , the police and other relevant agencies responded to reports of the boat being stuck on Sunday when they offered the crew assistance. The vessel, Day Dawn N , was last known to be engaged in fishing. according to the Marine Traffic website. Another site, Vessel Finder, also states that it received the latest position of the boat at .pm on August . googletag.cmd.push FSR were tasked on Sunday last, following reports of a grounded vessel. Pat Carlin, of FSR, said the boat was likely to be there until mid-September when the tide would be high enough for it to re-float. “She’s stuck solid,” he added. “We went and assessed the boat, determined that the crew were safe and passed that information on to the police service,” Mr Carlin explained “We provided them with some basic supplies that they needed and basically the vessel is grounded and can’t be move until the tide is lted. “All relevant services were notied and are aware that it’s there.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Carlin continued: “I think they were up on the council pontoon and to the best of my knowledge they may have come from outside the area, I don’t know exactly. “They’ll have no choice but to wait, maybe with the sudden floods tonightthey’ll be lucky and might get re-floated otherwise they’ll have to wait until the tides are high enough.” The PSNI confirmed that police assisted partners, including FSR and Coastguard in liaising with the crew. A report from , shows that Day Dawn N  was bought for the purposes of fishing from Portavogie. It was said to be the first time the vessel had been based anywhere  apart from Kilkeel since her arrival in  from Banff where the wooden-hulled boat was built by John Watt  Sons as a trawler. Harbour master at Portavogie, Neil Warnock, yesterday said Day Dawn was based there but left a couple of months ago. “Somebody bought it for a pleasure craft,” he explained. “It’s not a fishing boat any more, the licence on it was sold off a while ago there. “The last I heard the boat was in Portrush, I saw a picture of it at Portrush harbour after it left here.” At Portrush, the assistant harbour master said the boat owner was only there for three days and he believed the man travelled from the Greencastle direction. He was trying to get himself a permanent mooring, he said, but wasn’t able to secure it. The owner left Portrush heading towards Derry where he tried to get a mooring in the town and ended up on the mud flats. “I just know that he bought that for pound. None of the fishermen like decommissioning so they basically would rather they go off. “So I think he bought it for a pound and wanted to change it into an Air B ‘n’ B, but we couldn’t offer him a permanent mooring in Portrush, so he was only here for three days,” the Assistant Harbour Master added. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Foyle Port added: “Foyle Port is aware that a small trawler has run aground at Madams Bank in the River Foyle. “There is no environmental threat or impediment to other marine craft. “Once conditions are right we expect the vessel to become buoyant again.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bark n Baths in the Springtown Industrial Estate has four dog washing stations equipped with a professional shower and dryer and specially formulated sham- poos and conditioners.  Co-owner Garaidh Tomas Grfiths said the idea came about after many dog owners had to start washing their own pets during lockdown. “All the dog groomers had to close but they were sharing videos online to show people how to wash and brush their dogs coat themselves, said Mr Grfiths. People had no choice but to do it for themselves, but they were bent over their bath and giving themselves a bad back. googletag.cmd.push Then they had to chase a wet dog around the house to try and dry them before they got that wet dog smell and after all that they had to spend another half an hour cleaning their bath so it could be used by the rest of the family again. Mr Grfiths, who also owns the Canine Lodge doggie day care, hit on the idea of opening a self service dog washing salon. “After lockdown people are looking to save as much money as possible and we are able to offer people the chance to wash their dog from as little as pound. googletag.cmd.push “Its great for people who have taken their dog to the beach or a country park and want to give them a quick wash and get rid of any sand or muck. Every station at Barks n Baths is set up with an industrial shower and dryer, highly absorbent towels, and PH balanced dog shampoo and conditioner and disposable aprons and gloves. A dogs PH level is dferent to a human so using the wrong product can affect their skin, coat and overall health, said Mr Grfiths If we can help someone maintain their dogs health we are happy to do it. A  minute session will cost pound and the price goes up from there to pound for  minutes, pound for  minutes and pound for an hour which would be long enough to wash and dry a big dog with long hair. There is also a private bay for dogs that may be anxious or anti-social. The private bay is partitioned off and has its own entrance so it is perfect for dogs that are nervous or aggressive around other dogs or people, added Mr Grfiths. We have had people come to us who have been told their dog isnt suitable to go to a groomer, so they are delighted this service is here. Bark n Baths is located at Site , Unit  in the Springtown Industrial Estate close to Cable  Accessories.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Shortly before nine oclock to be precise. Peter Buzzers back bar in Maghera is sparsely populated. Apart from the commentary, as Gaeilge, from TGs GAA  programme humming out of the TV on the wall, you couldve heard a pin drop. Its a Monday club with a dference. There are no boom boxes, no empty take away pizza boxes strewn around the tables nor half drunk people roaring into your ear while making little or no sense. Less than  hours earlier, two decades of concerted Slaughtneil planning and effort morphed into a slick hunger Loughgiel simply couldnt deal with.

Nine points clear and  months after the hurt of an extra time defeat by Cushendall, there was no catching them. googletag.cmd.push In his victory speech, Chrissy McKaigue thanked every man, woman and dog involved in their success. Everyone except Thomas Cassidy, who had passed away days before. He waited until the inner sanctum of a packed Slaughtneil hall later that night, when back among their own. The Four Seasons Cup was clasped by one victorious outstretched fist. The index finger on his other hand gestured to the hall floor scarcely visible below the throngs of fans, where Thomas taught him how to play hurling all those years ago. There wasnt a dry eye in the house. Even the walls wouldve had goosebumps. googletag.cmd.push On the Monday night, his brothers Mark, Declan and Bungazed at Buzzers TV with a look and a body language that money couldnt buy. Slaughtneil were at the top of the tree. The new Ulster champions had many helping hands to shape them along the way. But the Cassidys fingerprints were always prominent. Taking over the mantle of the Kellys, who sowed the seeds in the s. Mark and Declan seemed like eternal minor managers when, in the beginning, silverware didnt always reward their toil. On a monsoon afternoon at Kevin Lynch Park, a saturated Bun thumped the roof of the then prefab dressing rooms to the sound of campeones. A team he managed with former minor winner Eoin McGuigan, that included Cormac McKenna and Chrissy McKaigue, had brought home the bacon. It was another building block. Also seated for that Monday viewing was Dermot Doherty, a selector under Michael McShane who is now running his eye over the minors. The apple doesnt fall far from the tree. His father Barney and the late Eugene Babs Kelly managed the clubs  winning team. It was a fitting reward for Barneys ferrying of average underage teams, year after year, in the back of his blue Mercedes van. Often on the lookout for a th player to make up a team that would iniably be on the end of many a hammering. An U shield at a blitz in Dungiven and a South Derry minor hurling final win against Lavey were the modest s for the effort. A FIRST FEacuteILE Below it all, another batch was coming to the fore to cut new ground. In , under Thomas and Barney and captained by current minor selector Adrian Quigg, Slaughtneil won their first ever Feacuteile title. By minor level, with direction from Mark and Declan Cassidy, back to back Ulster minor titles followed, from a group that also won a football title at St Pauls and lost in the final the following year. A generation that also produced current senior football boss Paul Bradley. Under Thomas wing, they won the senior title in  before being beaten out the gate by Dunloy in the Ulster final. It couldve been the beginning of dominance, but instead it was a last senior title for  years as Kevin Lynchs and Lavey ruled the roost. Armed with more coaches coming forward, the Slaughtneil underage hurling production line succeeded Ballinascreens time at the top. No longer was the journey south to the Feacuteile a novelty. It was a permanent fixture in the calendar. With it, came families bonding together and each success inspired the younger teams to follow. A new wave of minor glory at Ballinascreens Ulster tournament followed, but Kevin Lynchs were still the standard at senior level.  was supposed to be the breakthrough year. After winning a league title, Slaughtneils young guns were the pretenders to the Fr Collins Cup only to be sent home with their tail between their legs again by the Lynchs. It was neighbours Swatragh that took the cup for the first of eight seasons into the Granaghan parish where it still remains. The following year, under Mickey Glover, Slaughtneil eventually wrestled clear of Kevin Lynchs on their way to glory. In Ulster, their gung-ho tactics and bravery put Loughgiel to the pin of their collar in a moral victory to ascertain the level required. For the next two years they faced Cushendall in Ulster, but again came up short. All the while the underage production line continued. The Fr Collins Cup was present at one of the underage management meetings, almost as a sign of the level that needed maintained. With every year, came one or two new players into the squad. The fact that Michael McShane handed Shane McGuigan his senior debut in an Ulster final, while still a minor, was a sign of their commitment to growing the team to a height to challenge the big boys. McShane built a management team to match the players ambitions. Every base was covered. Cormac Donnelly came in as trainer. Their games were all analysed. Like the footballers and camogs, the strength and conditioning made them a finely tuned engine. The pre-game routine was planned to the nth degree, so that all the players had to do was turn up and deliver. And they did. Three Ulsters later and their stature on the national stage has soared. Cuala beat them in the manner Dunloy did in . It was followed by defeat to Na Piarsaigh, a game they surrendered from a position of strength. How times had changed. In the s, when Tom Magill had Lavey at their peak, just winning a championship game was a challenge. Now, not being happy after putting up a performance on the All-Ireland stage told enough about the ambition. The Ballyhale game was the greatest statement of intent, taking the giants of club hurling every step of the way. In the physical stakes, they were able to match them and in the skills of the game they were not found wanting either. In an epic, they came so close to the biggest day of all. This weekend, they enter the knockout championship stage again. They will have the favourites tag. There are no two ways around it. Last week, they saw off Na Magha with virtually a reserve team. Only Jerome McGuigan, suspended against Lavey, started from their All-Ireland semi-final team. Thats how far Slaughtneils hurling story has come. From the days when getting  players for a game was an achievement, they have set a standard of skill, attitude and athleticism that the rest of Derry must strive to reach. Success comes in cycles. In recent times, Kevin Hinphey has followed his father into coaching and led Kevin Lynchs to back to back Ulster minor hurling titles. They have been swimming in Slaughtneils wake, searching for ato the top table. The overall Derry hurling landscape needs them, and others, to narrow the gap. To do so, they will need to match an unrelenting hunger for more success. When you have had barren years like Slaughtneil, you wont want to step off the perch anytime soon.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At the end of a dire game of football, substitute Ciaron Harkin latched onto a cross from Colm Horgan to volley City into the lead with just one minute left on the clock. A clearly dispirited Drogheda then conceded a second in added time as another substitute, this time Stephen Mallon, fired in a second goal to flatter Derry, who responded to their Europa League exit with a valuable win. In a game of few chances, Drogheda were on the front foot early on, showing a lot of energy and enterprise as they did not take Derry settle into the game at all. The home side could well have been celebrating an early goal. Darren Cole gave the ball away down the right and Drogheda countered, with Kane working his way in from the left, and he got a sight of goal only to blaze his effort high and wide without testing Peter Cherrie. googletag.cmd.push It took Derry  minutes to finally threaten the Drogheda goal, and it all came from another brilliant surging run forward from Eoin Toal, this time down the right-wing. Toal’s cross from the right won City the first of two successive corners, the latter of which saw Ada, Hammill cross brilliantly to Cameron McJannett who somehow headed over from under the crossbar when it seemed he must surely score on his debut. City were on the front foot immediately at the start of the second period and Ibrahim Meite, after a quiet first period, went for a spectacular effort almost immediately, his left-footed effort from the edge of the area curling wide of goal without testing Ross Treacy. googletag.cmd.push The visitors were asking the questions at the start of the second half but a Drogheda break, led by Mark Doyle, saw the home side very nearly take the lead. Doyle went on a mazy run through midfield right to the edge of the City penalty area, where his attempted shot was blocked. The ball however ran straight to Brandon Bermingham who tried a low first-time effort which had Cherrie scrambling across goal but it went just wide of the target. The game was heading to extra time before one decisive moment decided it – Colm Horgan breaking into the area and crossing for Harkin to fire in a fantastic finish at the near post with just  seconds left on the clock. There was still time for another goal to really flatter Derry as Meite’s threaded pass put Mallon through on goal and he smashed in his third goal of the season to send the Candystripes through to the quarterfinals. TEAMS DROGHEDA UNITED: Ross Treacy, James Brown, Conor Kane, Jack Tuite , Hugh Douglas, Derek Prendergast, Richie O’Farrell, Mark Doyle, Jake Hyland, Brandon Bermingham , Mark Hughes. DERRY CITY: Peter Cherrie, Ciaran Coll, Cameron McJannett, Eoin Toal, Darren Cole, Conor McCormack, Jake Dunwoody , Joe Thompson , James Akintunde , Adam Hammill, Ibrahim Meite.

He took trains from Milan to Torino, and then up the Susa Valley and around six hours later he was installed in Susa where it was  degrees.Race day dawned without a cloud in the sky and with the temperature already soaring, Hanna joined the front row of the grid designed for social distancing wearing his mask. The mask was obligatory for the first m. Hanna tucked into a front bunch that was a whorsquos who of Italian mountain racing. Hanna covered the first mile in :, and then at km the race became steep. He climbed well, as ever, encountering a dficult patch around the middle and then at about .km he spotted Baldaccini ahead of him, a past winner in  and .By now Hanna was in tenth place and with his climbing legs feeling good again set about moving up the field. He caught Baldaccini and kept pushing and on to the final k, with  flats and true flats at over , feet altitude, Hanna surged to cross the line in a brilliant eighth place.In the process he had taken the scalps of, not just the former winner of the race Baldaccini, but also Puppi, who had taken second place in last yearrsquos World Long-Distance Mountain Racing Championships, and Bernard Dematteis, the former European mountain racing champion.At Down Royal on Saturday, the sound of hi-tec racing flats reverberated around the horse racing turf as the ChampionChip Ireland Road Race Series continued following its event at Eikon, Balmoral, three weeks ago.It was only August , but could easily have been mistaken for late autumn as the blustery conditions from the remnants of tropical Storm Ellen continued to cause havoc in the quest for personal bests.It was a testament to the consistent running many had done during lockdown and throughout the winter before that there were many personal bests achieved.First up was the km, won by Mourne man Andrew Annett in : in a sprint finish with Annadalersquos Eskander Turki .

However, hersquos learning that he needs to improve his running on the flat to take it into the mountains and here he set a PB by around a minute with his : time. Phil Murdock broke the -minute barrier for the first time clocking :.Mark Holland has shown steady improvement in training and is another who is getting faster as he gets older, now in the M category. With a previous best of around  and a half minutes, he smashed that with a brilliant : clocking, a fine product for all the work he has done.Nichola Watson has had injury troubles, but over the past couple of months has been training consistently again.

At that stage, Bryansford had work to do with Clonduff leading - to -.Charlie Carr split the posts for Clonduff with a superbly taken score. Aidan Carr also got in on the act scoring a minor from play and Stephen McConville got his name on the scoresheet.Aidan Carr added another point and on  minutes the lead was extended further when Arthur McConville landed a big free to make it - to -.Bryansford needed something to steady the ship and they managed it on  minutes, getting their first score on the board when a free from Cathal Burns cut the gap to four points.Clonduff, however, were in no mood to get a case of the jitters and indeed stretched their lead to - to - when, in the th minute, firstly Tom Close got the better of his marker to break free to land another score, and then moments later, Barry OrsquoHagan did likewise.Bryansford were in need of some kind of encouragement and Danny Savage provided it on  minutes when he landed a free.Darren OrsquoHagan however went up the field and confidently steered between the posts to put Clonduff - to - ahead at the half-time interval.Early in the second period, Clonduff kept the foot on the gas to flatten the Bryansford spirit even more.Paddy Brannigan engineered just enough space for himself to punt the ball over Mark Reidrsquos crossbar.And then on  minutes it was - to - when Aidan Carr capitalised on space in the lsquoFord defence to leave Clonduff in the box seat.Clonduff were finding space more and more easy to come by and from a free after five minutes Stephen McConville made it - to -.Bryansford remained honest in the battle and made their third impression on the scoreboard when David McKenna pointed on  minutes.Clonduffrsquos machine was starting to purr productively and they rolled the scoreboard over once more ten minutes after the resumption when Stephen McConville knocked the ball over from play.The sides swapped scores on the -minute mark of the contest when David McKibbin made another minor from a free for lsquoFord, but Stephen McConville pointed for Clonduff to make it - to -.Fintan Canavan scored Bryansfordrsquos fth point before Stephen McConville responded in kind to again leave a nine-point cushion between them.The final minor before the next water break though went the way of Bryansford, Timmy Hanna notching it to make it - to -.In the th minute of the contest, Cathal Burns pointed Bryansfordrsquos seventh point. Savage kept pushing lsquoFord forward, using his experience to encourage those around him, and he knocked over their eighth score of the contest.Barely  seconds later it was Savage again scoring to give lsquoFord some real hope. That set up something of a tense finish to the contest when it had looked like it would be anything but.Twenty four minutes into the second half, Savage again was the commander-in-chief of the counter-offensive, making it three points in a row for Bryansford to cut the scoreline to - to -.A free gave Bryansford and Savage the chance to leave just a goal between the sides, and he made no mistakes, confidently floating his effort between the sticks, continuing his spell as a one-man danger to Clonduffrsquos superiority.However, as the clock began to become the enemy of lsquoFord, Clonduffrsquos Tom Close pointed from play to give Clonduff that crucial lead of four ahead again.Cathal Burns curled a neat point over the bar for Bryansford going into injury time to make it - to -.Then came a moment to stun Clonduff when Bryansford found a goal. Conor Maginn pumped the ball into the area and there was Timmy Hanna to palm it into the back of the net and force the game into extra time.The first ten-minute period of was a cagey affair, with both sides understandably more keen to avoid mistakes than push forward too much.Seven minutes into the first period, the first score was registered by Savage for Bryansford mdash it was the only score of that first spell.In the first minute of the second period Stephen McConville sent over a free, his seventh point of the afternoon. And when Barry OrsquoHagan pointed a moment later, Clonduff edged ahead by a point.That was clawed back again though when, eight minutes into the second period, Peter Brannigan equalised to leave the score - to -.Brannigan, however, was to make an even bigger splash just when this game seemed to have given you everything in twists and turns.He cashed in on a tiring Clonduff defence and fired beyond beyond the flailing efforts of goalkeeper Neil Trainor for a goal, to the delight of the lsquoFord contingent.

Like Pantridge, after the war he could neither forgive nor forget and had a burning hatred of the Japanese.During his time in captivity, Pantridge suffered badly from malnutrition, beri beri and other illnesses. Following the Japanese surrender he weighed less than five stone and was a physical wreck.On ing home to Northern Ireland in October  he was still very weak, but was determined to resume his medical career, getting a housemanrsquos position at the Royal Victoria Hospital.Because of his experiences in the POW camps, he decided to specialise in heart medicine. He became a consultant physician and cardiologist at the RVH before inventing the portable defibrillator in the s.Pantridge had become convinced that a patient might be savedan electric shock was applied to the chest as soon as possible after a cardiac arrest. There were defibrillators in hospitals, but they were too big and bulky to be taken outside.Along with others he set out to make a defibrillator small enough to fit inside an ambulance. In  the first ambulance with a defibrillator was operating in Northern Ireland, making the province one of the safest places in the world to have a heart attack.The mobile defibrillator was used to treat US President Lyndon Johnson when he suffered a heart attack in .Although he was known worldwide as the lsquoFather of Emergency Medicinersquo Pantridge was less acclaimed in his own country, and was saddened that it took until  for all front-line ambulances in the UK to be fitted with defibrillators.He had retired in  and died on December , , aged . A bronze statue of him stands outside Lisburnrsquos civic centre as a timeless tribute to his achievements.Cecil Lowry says of Professor Pantridge: ldquoFrank was a man, whose talents and achievements were so extraordinary, that the further we consider his character, the more he will be remembered by the present generation with admiration and reverence.ldquoThis book has told the manrsquos story of incredible bravery in the face of overwhelming odds during the Second World War and his dedication to the concept of the portable defibrillator on his .

The way they have been treated is diabolical, he declared.Cllr Boyle said parents have raised their concerns with him, highlighting what their children experienced at the start of the new school term by having to wait to use the ferry.He also revealed that he became increasingly concerned when he highlighted the issue on social media and was told how children were being treated.Cllr Boyle said problems were compounded with the closure of the main Strangford to Downpatrick road to allow a number of trees to be pruned to allow double decker buses to use the route in future.ldquoMy main concern is that there was no prior notice in relation to the number of children who could board the ferry.

The Minister cannot allow all this to simply be thrown away.The Strangford MLA added: ldquoThe local community previously stood together to save Exploris and will do so again. I would urge anyone with concerns to make their voice heard and lodge their concerns and together we can save our local economy.It is believed that the poundm aquarium proposal could create more than  full-time jobs and would be the biggest attraction of its kind on the island of Ireland.The firm behind it, reefLIVE, says around  to  jobs could be created during its construction, with  full-time

He said the impact of the small building mdash redeveloped by the Parish Church mdash was expanding all the time.He added: ldquoI know that you will protect and encourage all that happens from there.Dean Hull paid tribute to Mr McDonaldrsquos contribution to not only Down and Hollymount churches but all those within the Lecale Area Mission Partnershipgroup.ldquoScott made a signicant contribution to LAMP and he and his family have been very much part of le here in Down and in Hollymount, also touching on the other churches within the group as well.ldquoScottrsquos ministry very much focused on Down Parish and Hollymount but he has influenced people in churches where and there are those who are sad that they cannot be with us this morning, the Dean continued.Praising Mr McDonald for launching Carols by the Lake and Blue Christmas initiatives, Dean Hull said the latter really touched those dealing with bereavement and loss and hopes that bothcontinue to feature on the church calendar.Mr Dorrian highlighted the key role played by Scott in forging relationships, referencing his work with the Pepper Johns Community Centre and establishing a link betweenHollymount Church and Hollymount Pipe Band. One of the bandrsquos members, Sam Gill, played at the end of Sundayrsquos service.Mr Telford described Sundayrsquos service as a ldquosad occasion as the congregation in Down Parish said goodbye to their minister who had touched all their lives.He said Mr McDonaldrsquos arrival in  ldquosparked renewed optimism within the church with the new man quickly making his mark, especially in relation to the Pepper Johns Community Centre which he helped deliver along with the board of trustees.He added: ldquoPerhaps the best tribute that can be paid to Scott is that he very soon became one of us and, deep down, I think he knows that he always will be. It was a hard decision for Scott and his family to make the move to Newry and it is important that while we are disappointed aboutthis, we support them and continue to do so.On behalf of Hollymount Church, Ms Blair said that Mr McDonald will be very much missed, praising him for his leadership and the ious initiatives that he spearheaded over the past four years.ldquoWe are all fond of Scott who was with us through thick and thin and ups and downs. No matter what, Scott was there, she said.Ms Blair added: ldquoWhile we are sorry to see him go, we wish Scott and his family all the best in Newry..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th August 2020 Students.jpg","title":"Students celebrate GCSE results after ‘challenging year’  ","story":"IT was a dferent GCSE results day this year for local schools and students as the need to maintain social distancing measures was a key concern.As with the recent A-Level results, grades this year were predicted by teachers as examinations could not be held due to schools closure over the Covid- lockdown.Down High Schoolrsquos principal, Mrs Maud Perry, reported that  students collected their results from two designated venues in Downpatrick at dferent times with social distancing measures in place.Nearly % of all students achieved at least seven A* A grades while six pupils mdash Katie Dickson, Ellen Johnston, Cameron McCaughey, Lauren McCormick, Rosa Morgan-Young and Anna Torrens mdash all received ten A* grades while Lucy Healy and Tori Marks secured nine A* grades each.Mrs Perry paid tribute to the hard work of her pupils during such challenging times.ldquoThis was a lovely year group and we congratulate them on these outcomes, which provide a firm foundation for the next stage of their education.

Brett Savage, who tragically died this weekend while in his early thirties, had spoken out frankly in the past about his own struggles with PTSD. He had served courageously on the battlefields of Helmand Province in Afghanistan, where the Royal Irish Regiment were involved in fierce fighting against the Taliban. It is entirely understandable that veterans not only find it dficult to cope with the memories of the terrible things they sawand experienced, and also that some struggle with ato civilian le. Many veterans feel more able to talk about their experiences in the modern day, but even that is no guarantee that they can put their struggles to bed.

Peter Cardwell at Hillsborough Castle.“I hope the book is a fun, frank and honest account of what it’s like to work in Westminster.”It’s his first time as an author and already his book has set tongues wagging across social media.Special advisers are a part of the government, yet who they are and what they do is much misunderstood. Key advisers to Cabinet ministers and the Prime Minister since the s, their role is shrouded in mystery, despite acres of newsprint devoted to high-profile members of the cohort, such as Alastair Campbell and Dominic Cummings.Peter Cardwell’s book lts the lid on the people Piers Morgan called ‘these miserable little creatures’, revealing who spads are, how Cabinet ministers use and interact with them, how much influence they have and how they deal with the civil service. Featuring numerous anecdotes from dealing with counter-terror emergencies in COBRA to explaining what a dental dam is to the Justice Secretary, to having your inside leg measured in a Minister of the Crown’s office, this book has it all.BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg said: “Peter allows you to peep behind the curtain of a much caricatured but little understood part of our political universe. With the structures of government in flux it’s a timely look at how some of the key relationships in Westminster work, and how they sometimes misfire.”Michael Crick, veteran political journalist and investigative authorsaid: “A book we have long needed.Peter Cardwell’s book fizzes with stories and humour from his experience as an adviser to four dferent ministers, and his years as a Westminster journalist with BBC Newsnight, ITV and Sky News.”https:www.portadowntimes news uk-news ni-man-peter-cardwell-loses-job-boris-johnson-reshuffle-A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Over my years as principal, we have had great support from the club and some of our past pupils have gone on to represent their county.For me, the notable achievement has been to see the way in which past pupils have progressed in a iety of chosen careers and been successful in so many walks of le.Another achievement is the way in which the staff both past and present have worked together as a team to have accomplished so many things over the past  years, not least to have been awarded Outstanding in our last inspection report.The development of the St. Cairealls Community Playschool on the school site has also brought me great joy over the past ten years to see it now as a successful pre-school provider with DENI status and funding for our local children.Having spent so many years of my le in St Cairealls P.S., it has become a second home and the staff and pupils a second family. Retiring for me brings mixed emotions. However , I am looking forward to having more time to spend with my family, my husband Kevin, our daughters Emer, Niamh and Fionnuala and their partners. Also our son Michael and his partner and my two precious grandsons Micheal and Braidan. Mrs McHugh concluded: I want to offer good wishes to the future of this very special school – St. Cairealls Primary School, Aghyaran and success and happiness to my successor, Mrs Michelle Ellis.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fbfddcdadbea   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bcfeccafbfecfa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1598431969897.jpg--post_primary_pupils_now_to_wear_face_coverings_in_corridors.jpg?159843197000","title":"post primary pupils now to wear face coverings in corridors ","story":"Education Minister Peter Weir has announced that guidance on face coverings will be updated to include wearing them in corridors of post-primary schools. This will come into effect on  August when schoolson a full-time basis. The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. “In relation to communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible. “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir said: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school. Parents should not send their children to schoolthey have any of the Covid- symptoms including: a high temperature a new, continuous cough a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.” The Department’s New School Day Guidance will be updated to reflect this recommendation.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fbfddcdadbea   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bcfeccafbfecfa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
