But when he and Stef were younger, I cooked them meat and fish, which they both ate. But for Jay, things slowly started changing and when he got into saving the planet more, he became a vegan.\u0027He\u0027s always been very conscious of the environment and wouldn\u0027t so much as drop litter as a child.\u0027    She went on \u0027Jay loves nature, all animals and wants to save the planet. That\u0027s what motivates him.\u0027He was previously working at Deutsche Bank but he hated it and was very disgruntled at the fat cats getting fatter. He was living in a very lavish apartment in New York and getting paid very well. Then one day he told me: \u0027Mum, I\u0027ve just handed in my notice. I\u0027m going to San Francisco to do my own start up.\u0027She added: \u0027He\u0027s ten times happier now because he\u0027s doing something that\u0027s changing the world for the better. Jay has been wanting to do this for years\u0027. His father was a successful businessman with Stef recalling their idyllic childhood which involved sport, nature and animals.Stef smiled: \u0027As kids were were into nature a lot and Jay loved rugby. We were not video games kids.\u0027We grew up in Epsom and were always out in the woods. That\u0027s what we enjoyed the most, being in nature and enjoying the environment. We always had dogs and cats as pets and if there was an injured bird, Jay and I would want to save it. To be honest, we preferred animals to humans.\u0027After leaving school, Jay took a gap year where he went to teach in an orphanage in Tanzania climbed Mount Kilimanjaro and also went on a guerrilla trek.In 2006, he returned to the UK to study Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Edinburgh University and then two years later, transferred to the UCLA. In between his studies, he also travelled around India on a bus and took part in various adventures such as tuk-tuk racing.Jay was headhunted by Deutsche Bank while in the US and joined the company soon after leaving university having earned two degrees.Marilyn said that she had no plans to travel to the US to meet Jay and that her head has not been turned by his new association with Harry and Meghan. Stef is due to go out to see his brother later this year. Ethic\u0027s meetings with \u0027gratitude sessions\u0027 where staff thank each other for their hard work and can pet the office dog given the title \u0027Chief Smile Officer\u0027, it was revealed today.The New York-based fintech asset manager has a laid back workplace common in tech firms on the west coast of the US, and says it helps its investors prioritise investments that they deem acceptable on grounds such as environmental and social goals, It announced announced yesterday they had appointed the Sussexes as their \u0027impact partners\u0027, the couple\u0027s latest move in their efforts to build what experts believe could be a $1billion brand in the US after quitting the Royal Family for independence and to earn their own money. Business experts declared themselves flummoxed at what an \u0027impact partner\u0027 is, although the best guess seemed to be a super-charged brand ambassador. The Sussexes have not said how much of their fortune they have invested in the £1.3billion investment fund, having been introduced to the founders by a mutual friend. Ethic, which was set up by Briton Jay Lipman - a red-haired Prince Harry lookalike from London now settled in the US having worked for Deutsche Bank - \u0027loves hippies\u0027 to invest with them, because the team, several of whom worked for JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, consider themselves hippies too.Today MailOnline can reveal that Mr Lipman is a former public schoolboy at exclusive Epsom College, where fees cost up to £37,000 a year. He was brought up in a grand £1.25million home on one of the nicest streets in the Surrey town.Mr Lipman makes no mention of his privileged schooling on LinkedIn or his social media accounts, but a recent profile said he went to a \u0027high school outside London\u0027 - but failed to mention it was one of Britain\u0027s most exclusive private schools that has educated a host of famous names including comedian Tim Vine and his broadcaster brother Jeremy, actor Tyger Drew-Honey and billionaire property tycoon brothers Christian and Nick Candy.Mr Lipman\u0027s co-founders are Australians Doug Scott and Johny Mair, who worked for banks investing in gas and oil amongst other things before they formed Ethic in 2015. Also included in its ranks are a number of dogs, including Roux and Gigi, apparently responsible for \u0027security\u0027, and Byron, who is named \u0027Chief Smile Officer\u0027.The animals regularly attend team meetings, which begin with encouraging staff to \u0027throw out a thank-you to someone who helped them that week\u0027. \u0027It gives everyone a chance to highlight each other\u0027s contributions and feel good about the work being done,\u0027 a post on the site says.  The company website lists its many team members from countries across the globe, all striking a different pose in quirky GIFs alongside personal thoughts on what sustainability means to them.  Harry and Meghan\u0027s latest move into big business came after their deals with Netflix and Spotify worth £100million and the couple announced their latest tie-up with a statement that said: \u0027When we invest in each other we change the world\u0027.  And in a joint interview with the New York Times, Meghan, a multi-millionaire former actress who lives with her royal husband and children in a $14million LA mansion, said: \u0027From the world I come from, you don\u0027t talk about investing, right? You don\u0027t have the luxury to invest. That sounds so fancy.\u0027She added: \u0027My husband has been saying for years: \u0027Gosh, don\u0027t you wish there was a place where if your values were aligned like this, you could put your money to that same sort of thing?\u0027,\u0027 adding the couple were introduced to Ethic by friends. It is not yet known how much they invested \u0027earlier this year\u0027 or if they are both being paid a salary for their \u0027impact partner\u0027 roles.  Ethic claims to only invest in businesses that meet its \u0027social responsibility criteria\u0027, including on racial justice, climate change and workplace standards such as gender equality and fair pay.  Mr Lipman, a University of Edinburgh graduate, claims clients make just as much money with them as those putting money into more traditional portfolios including fossil fuels and tobacco companies.Mr Scott, who worked in investment banking at Deutsche Bank, was listed on the Forbes 30 Under 30 and raised by \u0027two forward-thinking social and environmental activists\u0027, according to Ethic\u0027s website. Meanwhile Mr Mair, who studied Mechanical Engineering at Queensland University of Technology, has led product teams at a number of \u0027high-growth startups\u0027 including Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, BlackRock, Fidelity, Guy Carpenter and Goldman Sachs. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have already signed major deals with Netflix and Spotify thought to be worth in excess of £100 million after quitting as senior working royals and moving to the US in a quest for personal freedom and to earn their own money.In March he told Oprah he was forced to flee to Canada and make multi-million pound deals with Spotify and Netflix after he claimed the Royal Family \u0027literally cut me off financially\u0027 after the couple quit in January 2020.Harry also has a number of other jobs, including at a California-based mental health start-up whose value has now topped £3billion after securing new funding from some of Silicon Valley\u0027s biggest players. BetterUp, which took on the Duke of Sussex as \u0027chief impact officer\u0027 in March, has raised £220million from investors, valuing the company at around £3.4billion.  One of the leaders of the funding round was Iconiq Capital, a secretive investment firm which has managed the money of tech billionaires including Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey. Now the Sussexes have become \u0027impact partners\u0027 and investors at sustainable investing firm Ethic. Jay Lipman, the British co-founder of Ethic, recently said in a video on their website that they \u0027like hippies\u0027 as a company and considered themselves hippies too despite managing a $1billion fund.Harry and Meghan\u0027s Archewell website confirmed their latest business partnership, linking to a New York Times story which featured the headline \u0027Harry and Meghan Get into Finance\u0027.The Archewell website said: \u0027When we invest in each other we change the world...\u0027It added: \u0027We believe it\u0027s time for more people to have a seat at the table when decisions are made that impact everyone.\u0027We want to rethink the nature of investing to help solve the global issues we all face.\u0027 Ethic\u0027s website said it aims to empower wealth advisors and investors to create portfolios that align personal values with financial goals. The Sussexes hope their involvement will encourage young people to be conscious of the sustainability of their own investments.Harry told the New York Times: \u0027You already have the younger generation voting with their dollars and their pounds, you know, all over the world when it comes to brands they select and choose from.\u0027The couple\u0027s Archewell website highlighted their latest business venture, linking to the New York Times\u0027 story which featured the headline \u0027Harry and Meghan Get into Finance\u0027The Queen\u0027s grandson Harry and former Suits star Meghan acknowledged that not everyone could afford to invest money.\u0027When we invest in each other we change the world...\u0027 the Archewell site said.\u0027Be it through the investment of time (as with mentoring), investment in community (as with volunteering), or the investment of funds (for those who have the means to), our choices-of how and where we put our energy-define us as a global community.\u0027Ethic said it was thrilled to be welcoming the couple.Harry and Meghan \u0027share a lot of values with us, and we suspect, with many of you as well.\u0027That\u0027s why we\u0027re so excited that they\u0027re joining us as impact partners,\u0027 a statement on its website said.It said the Sussexes wanted to \u0027shine a light on how we can all impact the causes that affect our communities\u0027.\u0027They\u0027re deeply committed to helping address the defining issues of our time-such as climate, gender equity, health, racial justice, human rights, and strengthening democracy and understand that these issues are inherently interconnected,\u0027 it added.\u0027So much so, in fact, that they became investors in Ethic earlier this year and have investments managed by Ethic as well.Ethic, which was founded in 2015, has $1.3billion under management and creates separately managed accounts to invest in social responsibility themes. It aims to empower wealth advisers and investors to create portfolios that align personal values with financial goals.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle descended on the Big Apple in late September, and this may have been when the deal was done.

In better news, Romelu Lukaku has been passed fit after suffering muscle soreness while away with Belgium. Here’s Tuchel’s philosophical take: “We knew beforehand when Thiago would come back and when he would travel, so it’s nothing new. He will be back, this afternoon, hopefully, safe, Thiago from this match in Brazil. “So we had our talk today about Brentford, we had our tactical training today, and he missed all that. “He played 90 minutes, he has 12 hours of travelling, so that’s the answer maybe about his availability – he is not. “I’ve got used to a lot of things in national breaks, this is how it is nowadays. Are we happy about it, all the coaches with the amount of games our players play for their countries? No, we are not. Does anybody ask us if we want to change anything? Also, no. So it’s nothing new. “We speak about it during the UEFA coaches’ meetings, but it’s the calendar. And after that you have to accept it. I’m not even too frustrated about it. “I don’t like it, I think it’s too many games, too many competitions for the top players in the clubs. The game is for the players and the spectators. And the spectators want to have the top players on the pitch, they want them healthy, fit and hungry. And you cannot always provide it if you play so many games in so many different competitions. “I’m actually not too frustrated, maybe it’s just my body language today. I know what’s coming, I know the next national break is coming, we have seven games in between and we try to do the best in every national break. “Actually this national break was a little bit better for us, in terms of minutes and management of the players. In further team news, Reece James and N’Golo Kante are fully fit again. Christian Pulisic is still sidelined with ankle trouble, while Hakim Ziyech could miss Saturday’s game after a number of headaches.Argentinian pair Cristian Romero and Lo Celso along with Brazil’s Emerson Royal all played in the early hours of Friday morning. Colombian Davinson Sanchez has also been away in South America for World Cup qualifiers. Nuno said: “Yeah, they are travelling now. They will join us tomorrow and then we’ll see. Then we’ll see. “The reports that we have is that they finished their games well. Some of them played 90 minutes, Davinson Sanchez no, but what we are expecting is for them to join us and then we’ll see.” The Portuguese boss also came out with this somewhat enigmatic quote. “After the international break there are always huge issues that happen. We have problems but I will not say before the game.”“He’s in the squad, yes. If he’s going to start or not, I can’t tell you now because it wouldn’t be right,” said the United boss. “But he’s worked really hard throughout the whole lay-off and he’s been bright this week. “He had a 60-minute involvement behind closed doors last week, so he’s fit and raring to go.” Solskjaer has also given an update on the United rearguard, confirming that Harry Maguire has returned to training after being sidelined since last month with a calf injury. “Harry’s just joined us on the grass this morning, first time he’s been on the grass,” Solskjaer said. “Raphael (Varane)’s got an injury and out for a few weeks, but Victor (Lindelof) and Eric (Bailly) played in the internationals and got good game time, so that was good for us.”“I have got a contract until 2025, I absolutely love being here,” he said. “I’m very fortunate. I’ve got a great chief executive and a director of football who I have a close relationship with and a group of players that I really really enjoy working with. “I’ve seen all the reports around it but of course it doesn’t help anyone, particularly Newcastle and (their current manager) Steve (Bruce). “It’s the type of week that I don’t like in the modern game. “Managers and coaches work hard to do the best for our teams and then we have speculation and gossip that goes around and it can destabilise supporters and maybe players, but it doesn’t benefit anyone at all. “Thankfully I’ve been in the game long enough now to just focus on my job and my role, and I’m very happy to do that.”He says: “Look, as far as I’m concerned, I’m sure people will look into that. That’s for politicians and all the rest of it to decide on that. “It’s a great thing for the club of Newcastle and for me, the city too. I’ve seen the transformation in Manchester – not just for the football club, but for the city too – and I hope for the area and for the people and the supporters that there are exciting times ahead.”“Who wouldn’t want to try? I’m not going to give up the hope of it. Who wouldn’t want this job now going forward, the way it is, the way it looks in the future? Who wouldn’t want the opportunity to manage Newcastle? “Certainly I would and I’m sure there’s hundreds who’d want to do the same thing. There are exciting times ahead for the club, that’s for sure.”“I think they’re excited like everybody else. They realise there’s been a monumental change and I’m sure the players will want to prove that they can be part of taking the club to a better place. Certainly there’s been a change in the whole atmosphere.”  “It’s not about me. It’s about the club going forward, the team and, more importantly, getting a result on Sunday. There’s times this season where I think we’ve played very well. We need a win to get us moving up the table. “The most important thing for the fans is to see their team win a game and I know they’ll be right behind the players in an atmosphere which I doubt we’ll have witnessed at St. James’ Park in a long, long time.”  Guardiola said: “They played in Brazil yesterday and cannot fly back.” As for the Champions League trip to Bruges next Tuesday? “Maybe, I don’t know yet.” Pep also responded to a question about Raheem Sterling’s future following the England star’s lack of game time and recent hints that he could move abroad.  “Raheem is our player and will hopefully be an incredibly important player for us,” said Guardiola. “Some players want to play all the time but I can’t assure them of that. Always they have to speak on the grass – not Raheem, all of them. “What I want from Raheem and everyone is for them to be happy.”“I actually was waiting for some official statements about it. Like from Richard Masters or somebody else,” he said of the Premier League chief executive who has remained resolutely tight-lipped since the Saudi takeover of Newcastle last week. “We all know there are obviously some concerns over human rights issues. That’s clear. We all think the same there.” On the subject of the takeover itself, Klopp had this to say. “What will it mean for football? A few months ago we had a massive argument, issue, the whole football world, with 12 clubs trying to build a Super League,” he said. “Rightly so it didn’t happen but this is kind of creating a super team if you want. It’s pretty much the same guaranteed spots in the Champions League in a few years’ time. Financial Fair Play nowadays, nobody knows exactly if it still exists or not. Newcastle fans will love it but for the rest of us it just means there is a new superpower in Newcastle. We cannot avoid that. “Money cannot buy everything but over time they will have enough money to make a few wrong decisions, then make the right decisions, and then they will be where they want to be in the long term. Everybody knows that, and obviously the Premier League, Richard Masters, thought ‘Yeah, let’s give it a go’. “In five, six, seven years’ time, if the owners are patient enough, Newcastle is a new superpower and they will have enough money to buy the whole league.”  “We had to sort quarantine issues and the decision we made is the boys will not be here, they will go directly to Madrid, wait there for us, hopefully be able to play against Atletico, then will come back slightly later than us, so then they can come back in our normal procedure again,” he told reporters. “Obviously they could have flown into England but with all the quarantine stuff that would have meant they would have to isolate from their families. Ali has three kids and being away with the national teams and then 10 days in isolation with the same rubbish again... we need solutions for that and they are still not there. “They have played in Brazil so they already had four days there not in a red list country and that’s what counts. Then another six days not in a red list country, then they can come back and start immediately - so even when they go from bubble to bubble to bubble, it is still 10 days and for us that is the solution.” The Brazilian duo’s absence adds to Klopp’s selection issues as he has also lost Curtis Jones, who came back injured from England Under-21 duty, while fellow midfielder Thiago Alcantara is still not ready to return from a calf injury. It has not helped the Liverpool manager’s preparation and he is still not happy Saturday’s kick-off was not pushed back to the evening to give him an outside chance of fielding Alisson and Fabinho. “As you know, Atletico are not playing at the weekend and something like that would never happen here,” said Klopp. “And if it would happen then it would be ‘Oh my god, how can they do it for them?’. We ask only for a few hours that would have made it a little bit more likely they could have played but bringing them in for 12:30, there’s no chance for them. “If we had played seven o’clock then we would have probably tried it but neither Watford nor the Premier League was open to that kind of thing - their understanding of fair competition. We made the decision a while ago.” Having spent the past week bending over backwards to kow-tow to fans, it seems remarkably tin-eared of the new regime to leave a man few if any fans want at the club in charge.“I don’t think it depends on Patrick, we construct our offensive game in a collective manner,” he said. “Of course having a player that converts the chances increases the possibility of getting more goals. You asked me if it worries me, I say yes. “I would like that we create more chances at goal and increase the efficiency. Both things have a margin for improvement and of course, if Patrick were here, we would enjoy the contribution that he makes. But in a parallel way we are ready to be at the same level in the games when he is not there.”  Bielsa is hoping to include Raphinha in his matchday squad at Southampton after the winger marked his full international debut with two goals for Brazil against Uruguay in Manaus – over 8,000km away from Saint Mary’s - in the early hours of this morning. “Football is a state of your mood, but muscular tiredness affects your performance and puts the players at risk of injury,” he said. Bielsa will also be monitoring Kalvin Phillips, with the midfielder bidding to recover from a calf strain that forced his withdrawal from England’s squad. “He has possibilities to play and we will decide between Friday and Saturday,” Bielsa said. Stuart Dallas and Mateusz Klich are both available following international duty with Northern Ireland and Poland respectively, while Jack Harrison has recovered from a knock which kept him on the bench in Leeds’ first win of the season against Watford two weeks ago. Defenders Robin Koch, who will have minor surgery in America to resolve a pelvic problem, and Luke Ayling (knee) remain sidelined.  “When we won our promotion in the play-off final they won the Champions League,” said Frank, referring back to a fateful day in May day for two clubs separated geographically by just six miles. “I think that’s a very good picture of the difference between the two clubs. It is a team with world-class players and, with the transfer of Romelu Lukaku, it is more or less complete. They have top quality players in every position and one of the best managers in the world in Thomas Tuchel. I don’t think there is a weak spot. “Every game in the Premier League is a big game, but to face the European champions and the number one in the Premier League is a huge challenge. But we love that challenge and we believe in ourselves. We can’t wait for the game.” “We signed him because of the quality he gives us and we know what he can give us,” said Smith. “He shows that every day in training and it won’t be long before he’s in the team. We have never put any pressure on trying to handle any price tag or numbers because the players aren’t in control of that. That is what someone is willing to pay for them. “Their job is to go out and work hard every day and be ready to perform in the arena on a match day. I have seen a player there who is able to do that. He’s getting to where we want him to be. He got injured during pre-season so he was lacking the fitness in the first couple of games. He was getting up to speed, scored his first goal against Brentford, and then had to go off with Argentina. “We played very well at Chelsea and decided to go with the same system and unfortunately he didn’t get the nod in the Everton game. He has a lot of qualities but the one I have seen over the last three or four weeks is a drive and desire to succeed. I think all players need that and he has that in abundance.” Douglas Luiz and Emiliano Martinez will only return from international duty with Brazil and Argentina today but Smith expects to have them in his matchday squad for tomorrow’s derby. Leon Bailey remains out with a hamstring injury but he could be in contention for next Friday’s trip to Arsenal while Bertrand Traore (thigh) is being assessed and Keinan Davis and Morgan Sanson are back in training. “I don’t really react, or get involved in any kind of speculation, especially when there is someone who I have the utmost respect for sitting in that job, that the speculation is about,” he said.  “For me, I am in a very big job and a very big role here that I am very much fully focused on. We have got a top of the table clash at the weekend and it’s a game I’m very much looking forward to. “I’ve certainly got one eye on Newcastle, in terms of watching Brucey get his 1000th game. He’s a great character of the game, someone who I’ve got a personal relationship with, and have the utmost respect for. I’ve really looking forward to seeing him get his 1000th game. I think it’s a mammoth achievement.”“They’re a top side,” said Sean Dyche ahead of tomorrow’s game. “Top manager and top group of players. They’ve spent a lot of money but very wisely in my opinion with some top talents and then moulded it into a very good unit. “These are very tough challenges. But we have beaten them, we’ve drawn against them. We won at Liverpool last year, we won at Arsenal. Things can change but statistically it’s very tough.” In summer signing Maxwel Cornet, Burnley do have a player who has scored four goals in three games against Pep Guardiola’s men while playing for Lyon. The winger has been out with a hamstring injury but could return this weekend.  “Other than the true match fitness, which usually finishes off with playing, we’re hoping he’s fit and well and ready to go,” said Dyche. “He’s got a nice attacking threat, which is obviously why we brought him to the club and the scouts promoted the idea of bringing him to the club. Good all round early doors. “He’s getting better with his English, he’s adapting, his manner’s really good, he’s got a nice smile on his face, he wants to play. So far I’ve been impressed by him, not just his abilities. I don’t think Pep will be that worried about Burnley but he’s never lacked respect of what we’re trying to achieve.” Burnley skipper Ben Mee is unavailable after testing positive for coronavirus so Nathan Collins could start, while summer signing Connor Roberts is in contention for the first time. Matej Vydra and Charlie Taylor are doubts. All those evacuated were iniduals deemed to be at the “highest risk” in a country which has been under the control of the Taliban since August. The refugees left the cvountry yesterday. Football’s world governing body said it had received assistance in the evacuation effort from the government of Qatar, the country which will host next year’s men’s World Cup. “Fifa would like to express its sincere thanks to the government of Qatar for its support facilitating extensive discussions and for ensuring the safe passage of these iniduals, deemed to have been at the highest risk, on to a Qatar Airways charter flight from Kabul, Afghanistan to Doha, Qatar,” they said in a statement. “The Fifa leadership has been closely co-ordinating with the government of Qatar since August on the evacuation of the group, and will continue to work closely on the safe evacuation of further members of the sporting family in the future.” Taliban officials were quoted last month saying women and girls would be banned from playing sport, saying it was “not necessary”. Afghanistan’s women’s team withdrew from Asian Cup qualification in Tajikistan last month. Performance in the Asian Cup finals will dictate which teams from the continent qualify for the 2023 Women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. Female players from around the world, including Chelsea’s Norway international Maren Mjelde, are contributing to a fund established by world players’ union Fifpro to support footballers evacuated from Afghanistan. In light of this news, it’s worth revisiting this sensational article written by our own Suzanne Wrack about the dedicated crew of people who helped the women’s national football team and others to flee the Taliban over two remarkable weeks back in August. The 24-year-old, who moved to Arsenal from Brighton during the summer, also admitted that he doesn’t watch a huge amount of football in his spare time. “Football is so intense,” he said. “You come in every day giving 100 per cent. All I want to do is go home and not think about it, then come in in the morning fresh and ready to give 100 per cent again. I watch myself for analytical reasons. I watch England, maybe, but I’m always busy doing something. I wouldn’t just sit down and watch a game.” The Saints skipper is suspended following his deserved but somewhat unfortunate red card in defeat at Chelsea prior to the international break so Ibrahima Diallo is likely to get a rare start in midfield. On-loan Chelsea forward Armando Broja will return to contention having been ineligible to play against his parent club, but striker Che Adams will miss out after suffering a muscle injury while on international duty with Scotland. Leeds head coach Marcelo Bielsa has not ruled out winger Raphinha, who scored twice for Brazil in their 4-1 win over Urugay on his first start for his country in the early hours of this morning. Leeds will be without striker Patrick Bamford, who remains sidelined with an ankle injury. Kalvin Phillips will be assessed after withdrawing from the England squad last week due to a calf strain. “We’ve only played seven matches and it’s not like we’ve been the incredibly dominant team and deserved to win all the games,” said Potter. “The margins have been quite tight, they’ve gone in our favour this time. A lot of the time last year they didn’t. “A lot of the performances and performance data was good last year but because we hadn’t really got the points you couldn’t turn round and say our xG (expected goals) is this or our performance data is this. “We were down the bottom of the league and fighting relegation so you’ve just got to keep working. In terms of our performance level, the players have been consistent over a period of time and, as is often the case in football, sometimes you get the rub of the green and sometimes you don’t. “You have to deal with those two sides of the coin in the same way, not think you’ve cracked it when it’s going your way and not think it’s the end of the world when it goes the opposite way.” Steve Bruce has defied the expectations of many – himself included, one suspects – by remaining in situ under Newcastle’s new owners and looks certain to take charge for his milestone 1,000th game in management when his side host Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday afternoon.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins PhotosThere is likely to be a “significant removal” of Covid-19 restrictions at the end of next week, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said, despite concerns about a recent turn for the worse in a number of pandemic indicators. A further 1,627 cases were reported on Thursday, and rising infection numbers, hospitalisations and test positivity rates have caused alarm in health and political circles ahead of the proposed removal of most remaining pandemic restrictions from next Friday, October 22nd.HSE chief executive Paul Reid on Friday said the the recent rise in case numbers is “not a panic button” moment but an early warning signal.Mr Coveney told reporters in Cork that he did not think the Government would “abandon plans to remove restrictions at the end of next week”. He said the question was whether they would be able to do so “as much as we would have liked”. “We have seen a 12 per cent increase in the number of people testing positive in the last week - of course that is a concern. It’s not a big surprise, but it’s something we need to watch,” he said.“The Government will do what we always do when we make a decision in relation to Covid. We will take public health advice, we will look at the science and we will make an informed decision.“I think the likelihood is that there will be a significant removal of restrictions at the end of next week, but whether we will be able to go as far as we would have liked or as far as we had announced would be the case remains to be seen.”Earlier, Minister for Health Simon Harris said perspective was needed in the discussion on the further easing of restrictions given more than 90 per cent of adults in the State are vaccinated against the disease. He told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that the Government did not face a binary choice whether to proceed with reopening or to pause. There could, he said, be a third option where some restrictions were eased while “retaining vaccine certs or face masks for a bit longer”. He said any advice over the easing of restrictions needed to come from doctors not politicians.Vaccine protectionMr Reid told RTÉ’s Today with Claire Byrne programme that Covid-19 vaccines were protecting people from illness, hospitalisation and death, but that the evidence suggested the small proportion of unvaccinated people was having a disproportionate impact on the health service.He said that while “just 8 per cent” of the adult population remained unvaccinated, 67 per cent of those in intensive care were unvaccinated, with the cohort 17 times more likely to be hospitalised if they contracted the virus.Mr Reid said people returning to offices and engaging in more social activity were a factor in the rising case numbers. “This is a very early warning for us all,” he said. Regarding a Covid-19 vaccine booster campaign, Mr Reid said the HSE was ready and willing but was awaiting expert advice from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac). In the meantime, however, he said there was a need to encourage the 300,000 or so people who had not had a vaccine, and 70,000 who had received a first but not a second dose, to do so. Niac chair Prof Karina Butler said there were several factors behind the recent growth in Covid-19 infections but the “real elephant in the room” in the debate was the high level of unvaccinated people in the country.She said it was necessary to examine why that was the case and to fill the gaps in information to give those people the trust and confidence that getting vaccinated was the way forward.Prof Butler said now might not be the best time to give booster vaccines to the general population and that it could be more beneficial to wait longer and to help instead with the global vaccine distribution.She told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland there was no specific date on which Niac would be giving advice to the Government on a wider booster programme as work was ongoing collating evidence. Prof Butler said Niac was also reviewing evidence on the impact of infection on those under 12. “The first goal was to get everyone vaccinated, and that is still the prime focus if we want to reduce circulation and protect those for whatever reason the vaccine hasn’t fully protected them,” she said. “As always we are following the evidence. We know that immunity is quite long-lasting.”Under pressureMr Reid acknowledged that the hospital system was under pressure with the numbers presenting to emergency departments some 20 per cent above pre-pandemic levels. “This is going to be a very challenging winter,” he said, adding private hospitals would be part of the solution.HSE chief operations officer Anne O’Connor earlier told Newstalk there were just 100 available hospital beds in the State last night out of the 12,000 across the health system.She said the health service was going to do things in a different way to try to keep people out of hospital amid rising pressures due to Covid-19 and other matters.“It’s only October, but it’s like the first week in January” she told Newstalk Breakfast of the numbers attending emergency departments. “Hospitals are very busy – there are significant numbers attending emergency departments, far in excess of what we saw in 2020 and 2019.”Ms O’Connor said the HSE intended to focus on community care, utilising nursing homes for step down beds and home support to create extra capacity. “It’s about having a range of options,” she said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose. Anyone over the age of 12 can\u0026nbsp now register for a vaccine.

Photograph: Nick BradshawFormer Stormont first minister Peter Robinson has accused the EU of “irrational political prejudice” and warned that it must “go back to the drawing board” over the Northern Ireland Protocol. The ex-DUP leader described reforms to the post-Brexit arrangements outlined by European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic on Wednesday as an “upgrade” but insisted “much more movement will be required” to bring unionists on board.He suggested triggering the contentious Article 16 of the protocol - which allows the EU or UK to unilaterally suspend aspects of its operations if either side considers them to be causing “economic, societal or environmental difficulties” - may be necessary “to achieve that goal”. Mr Robinson also accuses the SDLP, Alliance and Sinn Féin of a “grovelling endorsement” of the EU’s proposed reforms, which would scrap most checks on goods moving between Britain and the North.The de facto Irish Sea border was erected under the protocol, agreed by London and Brussels, to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and protect the EU single market after the UK pulled out of the bloc. “What gets me most is the irrational political prejudice and overbearing haughtiness of the EU, who think that it is a greater priority to ensure there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland than between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom of which we are part,” Mr Robinson wrote in his weekly column for The Newsletter. Favoured by nationalistsHe alleged that Mr Sefcovic was only interested in protecting gains from the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement which are favoured by nationalists. The 1998 peace deal was “damaging” and “it is heresy for any unionist, especially with the benefit of hindsight, to praise” it, he wrote. Mr Robinson said the agreement “threw the jail gates open for terrorists to flood out, destroyed the RUC, allowed Sinn Féin into government while republicans held on to their bombs and guns, continued murdering, relentlessly persisted with their criminality, while refusing to support the police or recognise the authority of the courts”.He said he was “unimpressed” by the SDLP, Sinn Féin and the Alliance party offering a “grovelling endorsement of the EU proposals”. “These parties welcomed the protocol in its original form and there would have been no change if it had been left to them,” he wrote. “They are content to maintain the denial of democratic accountability for laws that will be made by the EU and imposed in Northern Ireland. They accept that the EU should be both advocate and judge in its own cause when there is a dispute about trading matters.‘Sleight of hand’“They endorse the constitutional sleight of hand that declares Great Britain to be a ‘third country’ in relation to Northern Ireland trade and they applaud maintaining checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.”Mr Robinson said the EU was also completely ignoring “ the constitutional, legal, and democratic implications of the protocol and seems to think it is only the trading element of the protocol that needs to be considered.”“Even in that narrow perspective they fall short. If the problem was limited to the costly compliance requirements and time-consuming checking of goods within the United Kingdom the answer is the removal of those checks, not a reduction in their number,” he wrote.

Photograph: Getty ImagesThe official wizard of New Zealand has been cast from the public payroll to spell the end to a 23-year legacy.The wizard, Ian Brackenbury Channell (88), had been contracted to Christchurch city council for the past two decades to promote the city through “acts of wizardry and other wizard-like services”, at a cost of $16,000 (€9,728) a year. He has been paid a total of $368,000.The wizard, who was born in England, began performing acts of wizardry and entertainment in public spaces shortly after arriving in New Zealand in 1976. When the council originally tried to stop him, the public protested. In 1982, the New Zealand Art Gallery Directors Association said he had become a living work of art, and then, in 1990, the prime minister at the time, Mike Moore, asked that he consider becoming the wizard of New Zealand.“I am concerned that your wizardry is not at the disposal of the entire nation,” Mr Moore wrote on his official letterhead.“I suggest therefore that you should urgently consider my suggestion that you become the Wizard of New Zealand, Antarctica and relevant offshore areas . . . no doubt there will be implications in the area of spells, blessings, curses, and other supernatural matters that are beyond the competence of mere Prime Ministers.”Since then he has performed in Christchurch, rain-danced in New Zealand and Australia during droughts, and was awarded the Queen’s service medal in the 2009 Queen’s birthday honours. But he has also encountered controversy with off-colour comments about women.In an April screening of channel Three’s comedy current affairs show New Zealand Today, the wizard said he liked to tease women by telling them they were devious, and said “they use cunning to get men who are thick”.“I love women, I forgive them all the time, I’ve never struck one yet. Never strike a woman because they bruise too easily is the first thing, and they’ll tell the neighbours and their friends . . . and then you’re in big trouble.”The council said it had sent the wizard a letter thanking him for his services to Christchurch over the past decades and informing him they were closing the book on his contract, a council spokesperson, Lynn McClelland, said.The wizard said the council had decided to stop paying him because he did not fit “the vibes” of the city. He said he was a provocateur.“It implies that I am boring and old, but there is nobody else anything like me in Christchurch.“It’s just they don’t like me because they are boring old bureaucrats and everyone likes me and no one likes them,’’ he said.The wizard is a well-known face to Christchurch residents, but in recent years, his presence has diminished, and sightings have become rare. He says that is because the council has made him invisible and would not respond to his suggestions to improve tourism.“But when they cancelled this honorarium, everyone got furious, they have awakened a hornet’s nest here, it’s hilarious.

Photograph: Dan BaliltyThe New York TimesFour months into one of its worst Covid-19 outbreaks, Israel is seeing a sharp drop in new infections and severe illness, aided by its use of vaccine boosters, vaccine passports and mask mandates, scientists and health officials have said.Israel was struck by its fourth coronavirus wave in June, fuelled by the fast-spreading Delta variant.Rather than imposing new lockdown measures, the government bet on a third booster dose of the Pfizer vaccine for people age 12 and up, mandated face coverings and enforced use of a ‘Green Pass’ - proof of vaccination, recovery from the illness or a negative test for the virus - at restaurants and other venues, even for children.Since peaking in early September, daily infections in Israel have fallen more than 80 per cent, with severe cases nearly halved.“Day by day we are breaking the Delta wave,” prime minister Naftali Bennett said, crediting government policy for “close, smart and flexible management allowing life alongside coronavirus”.Israel’s ‘Living with Covid’ strategy, which has not come without cost or controversy, has kept schools and the economy open.The Israeli Health Ministry on Thursday presented the latest safety and effectiveness data from its booster campaign to a panel of advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration considering authorisation of additional booster shots.The data show that among people over 60 - the first group to receive boosters - infections began declining rapidly about two weeks after third doses were administered, while still climbing among other age groups.Reproduction rateA data analysis by Doron Gazit and Yinon Ashkenazy of the Hebrew University’s Covid-19 monitoring team showed the virus’ reproduction rate - its ability to spread - began a sharp fall among each age group following the third shot.Two months into the Delta wave, vaccinated people over the age of 60 made up more than half of severe Covid-19 cases. The majority were over 70 with health conditions that put them at higher risk.Since administration of boosters, mostly unvaccinated, often younger, people are bearing the brunt of serious illness. They make up about 75 per cent of hospitalised patients in severe condition, while those vaccinated with two or three shots account for a quarter of such cases.A third dose has so far been effective in curbing severe breakthrough cases among vaccinated people age 40 and up, according to the health ministry.There is less available data for teens and young adults. However, the ministry said its findings so far show that a third dose has not increased the risk of myocarditis, a rare heart inflammation, in younger people.Ran Balicer, who heads the Israeli government’s coronavirus expert advisory panel, said a combination of measures had curbed the Delta surge.“These include the masks mandate, the Green Passes, the massive testing both with PCR testing and rapid antigen tests. But undoubtedly, the most important impactful factor in bringing down the Delta summer surge was the mass vaccination campaign with booster doses,” Balicer said.In England, where boosters have been administered to roughly 5 per cent of the population, masks have largely been abandoned and vaccine passports are not mandatory, Covid-19 cases are on the rise.PrematureSome scientists said Israel’s decision in late August to approve a third vaccine dose for young adults and teens was premature, lacking clear evidence of a benefit. They argue the focus should still be on convincing unvaccinated people to accept the shots.The US and several European countries have so far authorised boosters only for older adults, people with weakened immune systems or workers at high risk of coronavirus exposure.The World Health Organisation has pleaded with wealthier nations to hold off on boosters while many countries struggle to access vaccines.“Israel rushed, even gambled, when it came to approving a third dose for the whole population and not to specific age groups as other countries did,” said Hagai Levine, professor of epidemiology at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. “In the midst of a pandemic you sometimes have to make a decision based on partial evidence...Nevertheless, the jury is still out on third doses for the entire population.”Bennett has been criticized by some scientists for rejecting tougher measures that would have kept Delta infections lower from the start. They included government health officials who feared the ‘Living with Covid’ policy exacted too heavy a toll.“We have 1,400 people who died in this wave. So there are benefits to keeping the economy open and there is some cost to that,” Sharon Alroy-Preis, head of public health at Israel’s Health Ministry, told The Jerusalem Post conference this weekPossibly avoidedBy September, hospitals strained to care for Covid-19 cases that could have perhaps been avoided, doctors and health officials said.“It’s a good policy, but it has its price,” said Yael Haviv-Yadid, head of the critical care ward at Sheba Medical Centre, whose unit saw an influx of young, unvaccinated patients. “The teams are very tired, burned out.”So far, 3.7 million people have taken a third shot, more than a third of Israel’s population.“Israel was the first country to deal with the combined challenge posed by the Delta variant and mass waning immunity, but it is definitely not the last” Balicer cautioned.“Other countries that will be faced with this complex challenge will have to figure out their own balance,” he added, “and the costs can be high.” - ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"banksys shredded artwork sells 186m record artist","story":"A partially shredded Banksy painting has sold for £18,582,000 at auction.His artwork Love Is In The Bin was sold in London by auction house Sotheby\u0027s, which said the fee was a record for the street artist.The painting, originally titled Girl With Balloon, hit headlines in 2018 when it partially self-destructed at the conclusion of a previous auction in which it had been sold for £1.1 million.The canvas was passed through a secret shredder hidden inside the large frame, leaving the bottom half in tatters and only a solitary red balloon left on a white background in the frame.Love Is In The Bin outperformed its price estimate of between £4 million and £6 million.Girl With Balloon, which depicts a small child reaching up towards a heart-shaped red balloon, was originally stencilled on a wall in east London and has been endlessly reproduced, becoming one of Banksy\u0027s best-known images.Alex Branczik, chairman of modern and contemporary art at Sotheby\u0027s Asia, said: It is almost three years to the day since one of the most ingenious moments of performance art this century made auction history.It has been a whirlwind to follow the journey of this now legendary piece and to have it back in our midst, offering it tonight in the very room it was created by the artist.Banksy is no stranger to making headlines and this latest chapter in his story has captured imaginations across the world - we can only begin to guess what might come next.The seller of the artwork, who placed the £1 million winning bid on Girl With Balloon, previously described the shredding of the artwork as surreal.They added that he became the accidental - but very privileged - owner of Love Is In The Bin.In March, Banksy raised more than £16 million for health projects by auctioning Game Changer, a hand-painted image showing a young boy playing with superhero dolls.While Batman and Spiderman are discarded in a bin, the child clutches a figure of a masked nurse wearing a cape.More from NewsSir David Amess dies: Conservative MP stabbed to death at surgerySir David Amess dies: Past attacks on MPs and how they happen with alarmingly regularityChina launching equivalent of Royal Navy every four yearsAnother Winter of Discontent wouldn\u0026#39t be good for the unions - or LabourWho was Sir David Amess?

But the future heir’s tart response to Jeff Bezos flying William Shatner to space this week – “We need some of the world’s greatest brains and minds fixed on trying to repair this planet, not trying to find the next place to go and live,” the Duke of Cambridge said – had echoes of Scott-Heron’s influential 1970 spoken-word track, Whitey on the Moon.Over clattering percussion, Scott-Heron pretty much nailed the disinterested shrug of people at the hard end of the world’s problems at seeing Neil Armstrong’s landmark 1969 moon walk: “A rat done bit my sister Nell, with Whitey on the moon. Her face and arms began to swell, and Whitey’s on the moon,” his languid vocals proclaim.Certainly, at first sight, the regular transport of wealthy people into low Earth orbit – a prospect now closer than ever – seems like the answer to a question the planet wasn’t asking.SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket burns kerosene and Virgin’s VSS Unity uses a solid carbon-based fuel, hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene and liquid nitrous oxide. Which, Eloise Marais, associate professor of physical geography at University College London, estimates burn 200-300 tonnes of carbon dioxide per launch. Split between four or so passengers, this compares highly unfavourably with the one to three tonnes of carbon dioxide per passenger for long-haul flights. While there were only 114 rocket launches in the whole of 2020, Sir Richard Branson’s ambition alone is for 400 flights per year.But might such forays have their uses for the whole of mankind after all?Space travel and the environmental movement have been strange bedfellows ever since the Pioneer 1 satellite used the first practical solar panels in 1958. Satellites have been driving innovation in solar panels ever since, and have proven crucial in determining crop health, forest fires, glacier coverage, the spread of urban development and damage to the rainforests.Indeed, space travel has been a rich source of new green tech. The hydrogen and fuel cell technologies invented to take Apollo astronauts into space are now touted as a clean, reliable (albeit achingly expensive) alternative to batteries that can power anything from aeroplanes, such as the Pathfinder and Helio prototypes, to warships. Home insulation – hello there, Insulate Britain – owes much to spacesuit design.Meanwhile, NASA is a leader in green engineering. By necessity, all human space travel involves recycling practically everything – water, air and food – so the space agency has been responsible for breakthroughs in water filtration, waste water treatment and soil cleaning agents. It is also one of the world’s biggest researchers into the science of hydroponics – growing crops without using land resources.“Space-based technologies and space-derived information are central to climate knowledge, science, monitoring and early warning,” says Nick Shave, chair of UKspace, the trade association of the British space industry. “In the future, new applications of satellite data, combined with satellite positioning and communications technologies, will help drive down carbon emissions as well as providing key capabilities required to manage the devastating effects of the climate emergency to countries and communities around the world.”The link between the environment and space travel is even more far-out than that. Bill Anders, crew member of the Apollo 8 mission, became the first human to witness the Earth peeking over the Moon’s horizon in 1968. Anders had been snapping the Moon’s surface on a scouting mission for future landings when he took the photograph later known as Earthrise. That single snap is credited with inspiring the first Earth Day in 1970, about which Anders later said: “We came all this way to explore the Moon, and the most important thing is that we discovered the Earth.”California’s environmental movement of the early 1970s gave birth to the Whole Earth Catalogue, a compendium of product listings, how-to diagrams and educational ephemera intended for the back-to-the-land movement, which featured Earthrise on its first cover. Published quarterly in 1971 and sporadically thereafter, its biggest influence was on Silicon Valley: founders of Airbnb, Stripe and Facebook, early-internet architects including Larry Brilliant, Lee Felsenstein, Ted Nelson and Steve Jobs, described the Catalog as “Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along”.This freak-powerbillionaire crossover means that while SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy emits more CO2 in a few minutes than the average car would in more than two centuries, in 2019 it carried a NASA-funded test satellite known as the Green Propellant Infusion Mission, to replace the outrageously polluting and ferociously lethal hydrazine. The new hydroxyl ammonium nitrate fueloxidizer blend – called AF-M315E for short – can be carried around without wearing a hazmat suit, is more efficient and emits more water than CO2.By comparison, Bezos’s rocket, Blue Origin, is powered by a mix of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, meaning its carbon footprint – in flight, if not in construction – is zero. Given Blue Origin’s reusable launch vehicle, the project’s biggest overall source of CO2 is likely to be the crew and passengers’ flights to its Texas launch site. Just don’t mention the CO2 given off by Amazon’s server farms…And then there’s the real out-there thinking of Elon Musk. Musk has credited his drive to many things – including growing up in apartheid South Africa and leaving aged 17, rather than serve in what he called “a fascist army” – but the man’s absolute conviction that the Earth is doomed explains his unsettling desire to move to Mars.“A lot of my motivation comes from looking at things that don’t work well and feeling a bit sad about how it would manifest in the future,” he has said. “If that would result in an unhappy future, then it makes me unhappy, so I want to fix it.”Alongside the Tesla, the car that made electric vehicles cool at last, he’s proposed ‘Hyperloop’ high-speed transportation systems, using reduced pressure tubes to reach speeds around 600mph – which Branson has neatly whipped from under his nose with the all-electric Virgin Hyperloop’s first successful test earlier this year. Musk has put up $100 million for carbon capture technology, and given up on cryptocurrencies due to their voracious dependency on electricity.The UK is clinging on to the edge of all this. British rocket maker Orbex is pioneering bio-propane fuel that chief executive Chris Larmour says can cut CO2 emissions by 90 per cent, compared with traditional launch fuel. “Climate change is real, and we don’t want to make it worse,” he explains.After Brexit, the UK is no longer part of Galileo and EGNOS, the EU-owned satnav systems, but we’re hustling to get involved in its Copernicus Earth Observation programme, and we’ve still got a role in the soon-to-be carbon-neutral European Space Agency. “The UK has already taken a lead in committing to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,” says Shave. “The next step should be properly investing in our space industry to help us become a world leader in action as well as words.”If we start to dream of space again, perhaps we can start to get a genuinely global perspective. If we can solve problems down here by trying to put someone on the Moon, what could we achieve if we all got a chance to see Earth rise?More from NewsSir David Amess dies: Conservative MP stabbed to death at surgeryQueen advised to give up regular drinkingSir David Amess dies: Past attacks on MPs and how they happen with alarmingly regularityChina launching equivalent of Royal Navy every four yearsAnother Winter of Discontent wouldn\u0026#39t be good for the unions - or LabourMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"masterpiece worthy monet","story":"Standing on a \u0027Monet bridge\u0027, visitors to Cornwall\u0027s Trebah Gardens might well feel like they are immersed in a living masterpiece by the French impressionist. Despite being deep into autumn, Mallard Pond is a work of art with a stunning display of mostly blue hydrangeas. Two acres of hydrangeas border its banks, creating a wall of colour in late summer months and seen in this photograph as dotted pastels across the landscape.They were originally planted in 1949.

On that day the history of England changed for ever. But should we give greater prominence to another battle nearly 130 years earlier, Brunanburh in 937, which some historians argue consolidated Anglo-Saxon England – even if they disagree over where it was fought? It was certainly an epic English victory over an alliance of Vikings from Dublin and Celts from the far north and west. But the English triumph was short lived. The Vikings were soon back. The Danish king Knut (Canute) conquered England in 1016. And then of course came the Normans.So is the history of the rather short and troubled Kingdom of the English really so important? Did they leave much of a heritage apart from a few small churches, fragments of literature, and some beautiful manuscripts and metalwork? William the Conqueror and his successors after 1066 carried out what we might now call cultural genocide, wiping out or dispossessing the political and cultural elite, systematically demolishing nearly all the great buildings, changing religious traditions, and seizing the kingdom’s wealth.For some Victorians, who approved of the idea of progress through imperial conquest, the Anglo-Saxons were merely “lumbering about in potbellied equanimity” until civilised by the Normans. We have long put that idea behind us. In cultural terms, the English could claim primacy over the thuggish Normans. In particular, Old English literature was unique in a Europe dominated by Latin. The country was more efficiently governed than perhaps anywhere else in Europe, and with a high level of participation by its people. We must not idealise: this was a brutal warrior society, with many of its people enslaved. Yet its rulers, unlike those after 1066, did not need to live in castles, fortified against their subjects.Why then did the English lose – however narrowly – on that October 14? Partly bad luck. Partly that England was surrounded by enemies, attracted by its wealth: Harold was defeated at Hastings largely because he had just had to fight another battle against invading Vikings at Stamford Bridge. Partly because the Anglo-Saxons were incorrigibly factious.So what did the Anglo-Saxons do for us? They left an effective system of government, which outlasted conquest: England survived under new management, escaping the fragmentation of much of the Continent. Some of the system they created is with us still. They left us a myth of liberty: the idea that before the imposition of “the Norman yoke” the people were free, and one day would be free again. Myths are important, and for centuries this one – perhaps containing a grain of truth – inspired demands for rights. The most popular version, of course, is the legend of Robin Hood.Above all –against heavy odds – the Anglo-Saxons left us the core of the English language, preserved by ordinary people and by the Church. In a greatly simplified form, and with large infusions from Latin and French, an English language and literature survived and finally replaced French and Latin. The language of Chaucer and Shakespeare is not the language of Beowulf, of course. And yet today the hundred most frequently used words in what has become the world’s language are all derived from Old English.Robert Tombs is the author of ‘The English and their History’More from NewsSir David Amess dies: Past attacks on MPs and how they happen with alarmingly regularitySir David Amess dies: Conservative MP stabbed to death at surgeryCop26: Glasgow braced for \u0026#39humiliation on world stage\u0026#39 over shambolic preparation for summitChina launching equivalent of Royal Navy every four yearsAnother Winter of Discontent wouldn\u0026#39t be good for the unions - or LabourMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"china launching equivalent royal navy every four years","story":"Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the next Chief of the Defence Staff, is about to embark Britain’s Armed Forces on a fundamental reorientation. Anything less than a successful transformation to meet the threats of the future – a timeframe that would be better thought of in terms of months rather than years – will shatter the hard foundations underpinning any notion of a Global Britain.The tragedy of the recent death of Major General Matt Holmes, whose funeral on Wednesday in Winchester Cathedral was attended by 700 mourners, is that Britain has lost a deeply empathetic and thoughtful man with sound ideas about how best to operate a military force thousands of miles from the homeland. Adml Radakin will need such people.They disagreed about the role of Commandant General Royal Marines, but when it came to the need to project power to underwrite the international rules-based order, Gen Holmes and Adml Radakin were in the same boat.They agreed on the need to change and the need to get out in the world building partnerships. It’s not about having the marines turn up on D-Day, in the words of one senior officer. Better to be there early to prevent conflict in the first place.It speaks of a forward-deployed and persistently engaged force, underpinned by technology and integrated across all arms of the Government.And which region of the world seems most likely to provide a flashpoint for the next global military emergency?Answer: the Indo-Pacific. Of interest to Britain because of the potential to destroy global trade, harm allies and threaten British citizens. The Government’s recent Integrated Review of defence, foreign, security and development policy said Britain must “tilt” to the Indo-Pacific region. The review, seen as the cross-Whitehall blueprint for the next generation of British statecraft, was clear: international politics is returning to an era of state-on-state competition.Ken McCallum, the head of MI5, said Russia provides “bursts of bad weather” but it is China that is “changing the climate”.Unlike the challenge of the Soviet Union, the West’s relationship with China is one of cooperation, competition and occasional confrontation, all at the same time.That nasty mix makes for difficult politics and an even harder problem-set for the development of military power.Since 2014, China has launched more submarines, warships, principal amphibious vessels and auxiliaries than the total number of ships currently serving in the navies of the UK, Germany, India, Spain, Taiwan, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies. In terms of tonnage, China is launching the equivalent of the entire Royal Navy every four years. That level of military ambition is already having political ramifications, as the Asian giant seeks to literally redraw lines on the map (of the South China Sea, at least).Challenges over sovereign rights in the region are seen by many as a warm-up act for the main event – an attempt to reunify, by military action if necessary, Taiwan with China by 2049. Whitehall officials view that date as unrealistically hopeful – although no less depressing – and warn a significant event in the next five to eight years is more likely.In a speech in July this year to celebrate the centennial of the Chinese Communist Party, President Xi Jinping said: “Resolving the Taiwan question and realising China’s complete reunification is a historic mission and an unshakable commitment of the Communist Party of China.“We must take resolute action to utterly defeat any attempt toward ‘Taiwan independence,’ and work together to create a bright future for national rejuvenation. No one should underestimate the resolve, the will, and the ability of the Chinese people to defend their national sovereignty and territorial integrity.”Adml Radakin will reprioritise short-term military touchpoints in favour of a more persistent, and in places permanent, presence.The “transformation agenda” he initiated in the Navy as First Sea Lord will be expanded across the Armed Forces as CDS.The Ministry of Defence’s attache network is expanding by a third, looking for business, including of the military sort, explaining and espousing Britain’s values and interests. The Royal Navy now has a Type-23 frigate permanently assigned to the Gulf. Similarly, HMS Medway now focuses on the Caribbean with HMS Trent in the Mediterranean and around Africa.The Indo-Pacific region has not had a permanent Royal Navy presence since the Hong Kong squadron disbanded. The deployment of HMS Spey and HMS Tamar, two Batch 2 River-Class Offshore Patrol Vessels, seeks to change that and signal to allies and potential future partners Britain’s commitment to the region.Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and Japan will likely be visited regularly, for supplies, joint exercises and in support of wider government initiatives. Two new Royal Marine Littoral Response Groups will have particular focus on Europe’s northern flank and the Middle East, the latter based in Duqm in Oman.The Army and RAF similarly will look to increase the duration of deployments and build deeper relationships. It all speaks of prioritising availability over quantity. The latter matters, of course, but doesn’t always need to fly a union flag. If China is setting the weather now, rather than try to build our way to relevance – a futile hope – Adml Radakin will set the Armed Forces the task of building relationships across the world for when the storm comes. More from NewsSir David Amess dies: Conservative MP stabbed to death at surgerySir David Amess dies: Past attacks on MPs and how they happen with alarmingly regularityCop26: Glasgow braced for \u0026#39humiliation on world stage\u0026#39 over shambolic preparation for summitAnother Winter of Discontent wouldn\u0026#39t be good for the unions - or LabourWho was Sir David Amess?

You know that it is likely to end up with a long strike which could cost your members dearly in lost earnings, and that there is no guarantee that they will enjoy a pay rise at the end of it. You are trying to weigh up your chance of success – and then the Prime Minister comes on the radio telling us how he is going to turn Britain into a ‘high wage economy’, trying to make-out that a supply chain crisis is a good thing because it is helping boost pay, and that as a nation we can have our cake and eat it. How do you react? You are going to conclude that your chances of extracting a pay rise from the government has just increased immeasurably.It should come as no surprise, then, that Unite is threatening a lorry driver strike in the run-up to Christmas. It is a direct result of Boris Johnson signalling a lack of fiscal responsibility. In the case of lorry-drivers – most of whom work in the private sector – it is easy to attack Unite for its bone-headedness – why the need to threaten strikes when a labour shortage is pushing up wages anyway? Rather than strike, it should be telling its members: if you don’t like your pay and conditions and your current employer won’t offer you a rise, resign and offer your services to one of the many other companies who are currently screaming out for HGV drivers.But wage demands and strikes aren’t going to end with lorry drivers. Already we have had strikes at DVLA, as we have had on Scotrail. Once unions get wind of the idea that there is easy money on offer, pay demands are going to mushroom. And much of it will come down to Johnson’s own character. It is a good thing in many respects to beam with optimism, to make out we are all going to get rich from doing our everyday jobs. But when you are Prime Minister, loose talk can end up costing taxpayers a fortune.I would like to be able to come down on Rishi Sunak’s side in the obvious and growing tensions between Number 10 and Number 11 over fiscal discipline, although his record isn’t great either. It was he who came up with the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, subsidising our pub lunches. So, too, Dominic Cummings bears responsibility from beyond the political grave – it was he who advocated the suspension of fiscal discipline during a pandemic so as to offer rockstar salaries to hire the best people, culminating with consultants on Test and Trace earning £7,000 per day. Trouble is, everyone working for the public sector thinks they are invaluable – and in most cases they are right that they are of more use than the people who designed our lousy Test and Trace system. Why, they reason, can’t we too have a slice of this very rich government procurement cake?The government went into the pandemic already running a deficit. It is coming out of it with a hole in the public finances such as we have never seen in peacetime.

Quality is paramount for us. We have proudly analyzed more than 2.5million samples for NHS Test and Trace, working closely with the great teams at DHSC and UKHSA. We do not wish this matter or anything else to tarnish the amazing work done by the UK in this pandemic.It comes as West Berkshire Council said in a statement some of the tests at the Newbury Showground testing site, operated by the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC), have had results sent out that may have incorrectly shown as negative for Covid-19.After receiving reports from local residents in recent weeks that there were concerns about the accuracy of test results from the site, we passed these concerns onto the DHSC for further investigation, the statement added.The DHSC has now confirmed that a number of sites nationally may have been affected by this issue, including the one at Newbury Showground.Those who received a negative result for a PCR test between Oct 3 and 12, as well as their close contacts, were strongly encouraged by the local authority to take another test.Councillor Graham Bridgman said: Testing continues to remain important as we learn to live with Covid and anyone who has symptoms, or who has been in contact with someone who tests positive, should book a PCR test straightaway. We also strongly encourage the public to do twice weekly lateral flow testing.Around 4,000 people in Wales may have been given inaccurate Covid test results after technical issues at a laboratory in England, the Welsh Government has warned.The majority of faulty Welsh results will have been given between September 8 and October 12 and were from testing sites in the Gwent and Cwm Taf Morgannwg areas.Welsh health minister Eluned Morgan confirmed the issue is isolated to one lab and does not involve the wider network, including the one in Newport which is responsible for processing the majority of Welsh samples.Baroness Morgan said: My immediate concern is the information and support for the Welsh residents impacted and I have asked Public Health Wales to provide additional support and advice to the affected health boards in addition to the UKHSA communications.They will also be assessing the potential impact of this incident on the case rates and epidemiology reports for Wales.We will continue to work closely with UKHSA and NHS Test and Trace on the findings and actions needed and I will keep members informed on developments.Concerns were raised when people had positive lateral flow tests, but negative PCR results from the lab.The Welsh Government said it was made aware last week that the UKHSA had begun an investigation, prompting Public Health Wales to review cases highlighted by health boards in South Wales.Anyone who had a test from October 4 and received a result from the affected laboratory will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace by text message andor e-mail and advised if it was negative to book an appointment to be re-tested.It will also advise that their close contacts who are symptomatic should book a test.People who had a test processed at the laboratory between September 8 and October 4 will also be contacted and advised to get a test if they have symptoms.Those who have symptoms should self-isolate immediately and book a PCR test, the Government said.More from NewsSir David Amess dies: Conservative MP stabbed to death at surgerySir David Amess dies: Past attacks on MPs and how they happen with alarmingly regularityCop26: Glasgow braced for \u0026#39humiliation on world stage\u0026#39 over shambolic preparation for summitChina launching equivalent of Royal Navy every four yearsAnother Winter of Discontent wouldn\u0026#39t be good for the unions - or LabourMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cheaper covid lateral flow tests","story":"Cheaper Covid lateral flows to replace PCR tests for fully-vaccinated UK arrivalsHealth Secretary Sajid Javid on Thursday evening has announced that double-jabbed arrivals into the UK will be able to take cheaper and quicker lateral flow tests from October PCR tests will be replaced by cheaper lateral flow tests for arrivals into the UK Image: DAILY RECORDByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | comments Families flying home from half-term holidays can use cheaper lateral flow tests to prove they do not have coronavirus, the Government has confirmed.Ministers had pledged to axe requirements for passengers arriving from abroad to use “gold standard” polymerase chain reaction kits before the end of the month.Health Secretary Sajid Javid on Thursday evening announced the change for double-jabbed arrivals would come into force on October  - meaning travellers jetting back from half-term breaks overseas can benefit.Travel and aviation industry bosses had long demanded the switch, saying that expensive PCR tests priced many families out of foreign trips.  Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade said: “This is great news and we’re pleased to get it over the line in time for the crucial half-term period, which will be a massive relief to families desperate to get away this autumn. “Vaccinated passengers can be reassured that they do not need to book or take an expensive PCR test when theyto the UK, which will further reduce the cost of travel.” He added: “This is a major step forward that will support the desperately needed recovery of our sector.” The rule change means fully-vaccinated passengers and most under-s arriving in England from countries not on the red list can take a lateral flow test on or before day two of their arrival into the UK.  Passengers must upload a photo of their test to prove results as soon as possible, with free PCR tests for any positive cases. Mr Javid said: “We want to make going abroad easier and cheaper, whether you’re travelling for work or visiting friends and family. “Lateral flow tests will be available later this month for those ing from half term holidays. “This change to testing is only possible thanks to the incredible progress of our vaccination programme, which means we can safely open up travel as we learn to live with the virus.”  Transport Secretary Grant Shapps added: “Today’s rule changes will make testing on arrival simpler and cheaper for people across the country who are looking forward to well-earned breaks for this October half term. “Taking away expensive mandatory PCR testing will boost the travel industry and is a major step forward in normalising international travel and encouraging people to book holidays with confidence.” Passengers who are not fully-vaccinated and are landing from a non-red list nation must still take a pre-departure test, PCR tests on days two and eight and complete  days self-isolation. Paul Charles, CEO of travel consultancy The PC Agency, said: Itaposs progress butyouaposre fully jabbed you shouldnapost need to take a test at all. Testing measures are not only a faff for many but also amount to a tax on travel and put off people from booking with confidence, due to the higher costs. These barriers certainly wonapost help the travel sector to recover as quickly as it should be by now.

The Government has insisted it has already learned lessons from the pandemic. Ministers have also pointed to a public inquiry due to begin next spring. Critics want it to start immediately. Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who took up the role in June after Matt Hancock was forced to resign for breaking social distancing rules during an affair with his aide, was asked todayhe was sorry for failures which occurred.He said: “Yes, of course I’m sorry. “Obviously I am new in the role, but on behalf of the Government I am sorry for, during the pandemic, anyone that suffered, especially anyone that lost a loved one, a mother, a dad, a brother, a sister, a friend. Of course I am sorry for that.  “Also, all those people that may not have lost someone but they are still suffering - there are many people sadly suffering from long Covid, we still don’t know the impact of that. Of course I am. “There will be lessons to learn from this pandemic for this Government, for governments across the world, there will be lessons. It is important that is done. “There is going to be a public inquiry and I think that is the best place to learn these lessons.” Asked later what mistakes he was apologising for, he said: “I don’t know all the lessons that we are going to have to learn about this - I don’t think anyone does at this point. “I think the best place to determine those will be the independent public inquiry.” Comment MORE ON Keir StarmerPoliticsTory GovernmentCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They invited Levelling-Up, Housing and Communities Secretary Michael Gove to meet them in Liverpool in January.The offer came as the Convention of the North and the NP group of northern local enterprise partnerships published their demands in a -page blueprint, ‘The North’s leveling-up  Net Zero Partnership Offer’. Leading a “green” Industrial Revolution and closing the le expectancy gap between the North and South are among issues where action should be taken, according to the document. Efforts to narrow the education and skills ide and improve transport links across the North are also areas which need tackling, according to the plan.  Liverpool City RegionMayor Steve Rotheram said: True leveling-up has to mean tackling longstanding and structural inequalities that exist between North and South in this country on a wide range of issues, from healthcare and job prospects, to transport and infrastructure spending. “This is not an issue of party politics but one of fairness and social justice. “As leaders representing millions of people across the North, we want to work with government to make that a reality. “The North has been hit harder than the rest of the country, but I believe that with proper support we also have the potential to bounce back further and faster than the rest of the country too.” West YorkshireMayor Tracy Brabin described the plans as a powerful statement of northernersapos desire to get on with the job of leveling-up, working together across the North and with government. She added: Through a clear focus on our leveling-up priorities of health, skills, transport, innovation and leading the transition to net zero, we can deliver an inclusive, productive, sustainable economy that works for all northerners and for the country.  Convention of the North chairman Nick Forbes, the Newcastle City Council leader said: ““The country as a whole has suffered enormously during the course of the Covid- pandemic and the North of England, with its rich heritage and ambitions for the future, is poised to play a leading role in the national recovery. “But we need to create lasting, purposeful partnerships to achieve this, and key to that is winning the full backing of central Government.” A Department for Levelling-Up, Housing and Communities spokesman said: “Levelling-up the North means empowering local leaders, boosting living standards, spreading opportunity, improving public services and regenerating our town centres and high streets. “The Secretary of State is looking forward to working with the Convention of the North and the NP group to deliver for communities across the north and would be delighted to meet with them in January.” Comment MORE ON Michael GoveGas pricesLe expectancyLiving standardsPublic servicesThe economyCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Is the Queen a secret radical Leftie Her Majestys long reign has probably produced more carbon dioxide than any of her subjects, says Fleet Street Fox. But shes turning into a bit of a hippy in her old ageopinionByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsIn general, any -year-old dripping in jewellery that costs more than the average house will, when discussing climate change, state that it is someone aposs problem. And so it was when the Queen attended the opening of the Welsh Senedd, wearing pearl earrings the size of a mint humbug, shortly before stepping into a Kevlar-plated limousine to drive a single, solitary mile to the station where her personal train awaited her.She was caught on a livestream discussing the upcoming COP climate change summit, saying: Extraordinary isnapost it... still donapost know whoaposs coming, no idea... we only know about people who are not coming and itaposs really irritating when they talk, but donapost do.She might have meant it was irritating when guests donapost reply to invitations, but most people have taken it as a broad criticism of world leaders failing to save the planet.   Seeing as this is a woman whose homes contain a large amount of the planet that was mined, carved, shot, skinned, robbed or stolen before it was squirrelled away for her and her family, you might reasonably conclude itaposs a bit rich for her to criticise. But she has done rather more than most of her Prime Ministers to de-carbonise the country. Buckingham Palace has heat and hot water produced by a combined heat and power plant, with solar  in the offing. Windsor Castle boasts hydroelectric power fed by the River Thames, while Balmoral produces  tonnes of compost every year from its organic waste. She also sends old staff computers to be recycled, and redistributed by charities in the developing world.A quarter of the UKaposs power comes from wind turbines, a vast number of which are on offshore farms she technically owns, and which are leased from the Crown Estate. Sheaposs patron of  environmental charities, her husband had more than , and their eldest son has a -year-old car which has an engine converted to run on wine and cheese.Aside from the fact thataposs the automobile version of Boris Johnson, itaposs more than anyoneaposs done to make  Downing Street any greener. In fact, the real-time website displaying the PMaposs energy use is currently kaput. On the same day she was caught making a snfy remark about the Chinese refusal to come to the environmental party, climate activist Greta Thunberg said COP would involve many pledges that -you look into the details - are more or less meaningless but they just say them in order to have something to say, in order for media to have something to report about.And so there are two uncomfortable things to consider. The first is that,the Chinese donapost turn up, there is no chance the rest of the world could limit global warming to an extra . degrees. Islands will be lost to melted ice caps, species will go extinct, and mass immigrations will take place, all because Xi Jinping is too much of a capitalist.The second is that Her Majesty might be a secret hippy. An unco-operative crusty. A friend of Swampy. A hippy-dippy, namby-pamby, ooh-itaposs-all-got-to-be-a-bit-green, woke old greenhouse whinger.Read more The evidence for: . Sells own chutney outside house . Always carrying a bunch of flowers . Finds money unnecessary And against: OH COME ON.The woman has  gas-guzzling limousines,  private homes, another  she uses for work, two jets, three helicopters, a train, and had to have her diesel-powered yacht prised out of her hands. In , it was calculated she had travelled more than a million miles, equivalent to going around the world  times, in the course of her reign. And thataposs before you calculate the cost to the planet of  children,  grandchildren, and  great-grandchildren, not one of whom is ever going to catch the bus.Throw in the fact sheaposs a widow living in single-glazed, drafty palaces, with hundreds of bedrooms, and thousands of staff, all consuming water and electricity just because she canapost find her own cornflakes in the morning, and Queen Elizabeth II has a bigger carbon footprint than a T-Rex in a coal mine. Itaposs no good saying but she goes around switching the lights off. Thereaposd be a lot more light to go round,she hadnapost bothered to give us Prince Andrew.  But you canapost be a totally green Queen, whatever Meghan Markle might think. A Royal simply isnapost royal any morethey ditch the palaces, staff, and multiple forms of transport. Brenda from down the road might be able to hop on the bus to get to Sainsburyaposs, but Brenda from SWA is going to struggle with it. The Royal travel, state visits, and constant wardrobe changes are part of a job no-one wants to say is surplus to requirements. Staff, security, consumption, and the problems of maintaining ,-year-old castles are something she cannot do much about.Itaposs not like sheaposs about to live in a tunnel under Finsbury Square, or block the M in rush hour while daring a lorry driver to drag her onto the hard shoulder, and shouting SOD THE AMBULANCES!But one of the benefits of a Queen is being able to get her to say or do things that are accidentally overheard but entirely intended, like when David Cameron asked her to intervene in the Scottish independence referendum, or a politician not a million miles from Michael Gove lied that she was pro-Leave, and next chance she got the Queen dressed up as the EU flag to put him back in his box.  Thataposs why it was her name on the COP invitations. Itaposs why her being irritated will be reported worldwide. Itaposs why, perhaps, shamefaced world leaders will suddenly respond to a summit invitation they had hitherto ignored. Queens have power, and old ladies can tickle even the least-guilty conscience with just the tiniest hint of disapproval.

I never expected to hear from any of my former colleagues again and I was so embarrassed that they would have found out through gossip.  “I was quite surprised when one of them checked in on me a few weeks afterwards. I was even more shocked when they told me they had subscribed to me on OnlyFans. Despite her initial shock, Amy says hearing from the former colleague made her feel appreciated.

Alex Hollywell-Rolfe, , reckons she used to scoff up to six takeaways every week when she was at her heaviest, st lbs. But after going under the kne to have gastric sleeve surgery on the NHS in September , the weight has fallen off her.

My orders would always be enough to feed two people as I would have extra sides and dessert. Iaposd have a large pizza with chicken wings and cookies for £ - sometimes twice per week. Alex reckons each takeaway would cost between £ and £ and sheaposd buy six per week - on top of £ already spent on her food shop.

Images have emerged from Asda stores across the country showing freezer aisles completely stripped of the festive meat. At one Asda branch in Birmingham, a solitary turkey crown could be seen in a freezer drawer completely stripped bare of products. Elsewhere in the store, a sign read: Sorry, temporarily out of stock. At a dferent branch in Kettering, Northamptonshire, Brits had stripped the turkeys from the frozen food section - and also cleared out all stuffing balls. It comes as Chancellor Rishi Sunak promises there will be a good amount of Christmas presents available this year, despite images of empty shelves pouring in from across the UK.  Earlier today, customers mocked a Cardf branch of Tesco Extra after pictures emerged of a massive sunflower oil display in the frozen food aisle. Another Co-Op branch was rumbled for cramming sauce bottles into refrigerators. Earlier this month, budget supermarket Aldi reported soaring sales of their frozen turkeys and Christmas puddings. Food experts have warned shoppers to buy their Christmas grub soon and store it in the freezer so they donapost miss out. Families scrambling to find a bird and spuds has led to Aldiaposs turkey crown sales soaring up to , per day. Sales of Christmas puddings are also up by  per cent.  Some families may be hoarding up to £, worth of festive chow, according to reports. Sales of turkeys have also shot up at Iceland - who reported a  per cent increase since the same time last year. The prospect of a thin Christmas has been blamed on supply chain issues, caused by the ersion of vessels from a loading port facility in Felixstowe, Suffolk. The rogue items and empty shelves appear as shipping giant erting vessels from their facility in Felixstowe, Suffolk. Danish shipping giant AP Moller-Maersk warns the problem may continue into the new year.  A aposperfect stormapos is said to have been created by a lack of lorry drivers, a spike in imports, and Covid restrictions. Lars Mikael Jensen, head of the east-west network at Maersk, said containers are stacking up at the Suffolk port because there arenapost enough lorry drivers to aposget boxes outapos.The port is the off-loading point for most imported toys, raising fears of kids waking up to empty stocking on Christmas day, The Times reports. And today Tory Chancellor Rishi Sunak confessed the government canapost fix every single problem when discussing the issue. Mr Sunak said the Government would do absolutely everything we can to solve the British port issues. Global factors are being blamed for logistical issues, with nationwide delays at ports. At Felixstowe, ships have also been caught in sea traffic. Speaking to the BBC in Washington DC, Mr Sunak sought to reassure Britons as people begin to think about shopping for Christmas.  He said: Weaposre doing absolutely everything we can to mitigate some of these challenges. They are global in nature so we canapost fix every single problem but I feel confident there will be good provision of goods for everybody. Iaposm confident there will be a good amount of Christmas presents available for everyone to buy. Mr Sunak chaired a meeting of finance ministers on Wednesday as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank convene in the US capital.  The Treasury said Mr Sunak told the meeting of the importance of global co-operation to ensure that supply chains are more resilient as the world emerges from the pandemic. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Sunak said: Supply chain issues are being felt globally - and finance leaders from around the globe must collaborate to address our shared challenges. Today we have collectively agreed to work closely over the coming months - and together we will build a strong and resilient recovery. The Mirror has contacted Asda for comment.

Despite one leading scientist casting doubt on the existing evidence - with only grainy photographs in existence - many locals remain convinced it is real. It has been described at ious points as like a large snake, a hideous hump-backed creature a long-necked sea monster and an elephant waving its trunk.Have you got pictures of Morgawr, Nessie or another mysterious beastie  Get in touch at webnews@mirrorAnd with the number of dferent descriptions, some have now even suggested there might even be more than one strange creature stalking the Cornish waters.Cornish local Joan Hawthorne wrote: It seems crazy to many I know, but there has been so many sightings that how can they rule out for sure whether it exists  Scotland has cashed in for years on the Loch Ness monster - maybe we should start doing the same in Cornwall. Other suggested the sightings may have even been the Loch Ness Monster visiting Cornwall on holiday - or joked he could have a second home here. Sarah Barnes wrote: Thataposs why I didnapost see Nessie while in Scotland. Sheaposs on her Hollibobs down in Cornwall. Timon Hewlett added: Bet Nessie has a second home down here somewhere. Residents and visitors have recorded many sightings of aposMorgawrapos over the years since the first long-necked beast was allegedly caught by a fisherman  years ago.  This included the most credible yet by a former employee of the Natural History Museum, who claimed to capture the reptile on camera around  years ago. John Holmes, who worked as a higher scientic officer at the Natural History Museum, released strange footage which he had filmed three years prior in Gerrans Bay, off the Roseland Peninsula. He said at the time: My pet theory is that it was a living fossil. I think that there is a group of plesiosaurs going around in the oceans of the world. All around Britain there have been sightings of sea serpents.Despite the claims, a palaeontologist at Nottingham Natural History Adam S. Smith, said they almost certainly didnapost exist.He added: Unfortunately, living- plesiosaurs almost certainly do not exist today.In an extensive article on his website aposPlesiosauriaapos, he wrote: Even a good photograph of a clearly plesiosaur-like organism would not provide conclusive proof for the existence of living plesiosaurs. It is too easy to hoax photographs, increasingly so with the advent of Photoshop, etc. A compelling photograph, or preferably a good series of photographs taken in quick succession, would certainly warrant further investigation.

And one demanding dachshund will refuse to eat his whipped cream treat unless it’s in a specic cup. Harlee, a long haired dapple dachshund, from Liverpool, will not eat his puppuccino unless it’s in a Starbucks cup. But his owner has come up with a sneaky way to get him to consume a ‘fake’ drink at home, by saving the mini cardboard cup that Starbucks pup-cups come in. The three-year-old mini daxie’s TikTok is filled with videos of him enjoying his favourite treat, but a weekly trip to Starbies for the dog can prove pretty costly - especiallyyouaposre getting your own iced caramel latte each time too. Harlee’s owner tried to make Harlee a puppuccino at home, using piped whipped cream in a glass mug, even using a nozzle that mimics the piping of Starbucks’ pup-cups.However, the pampered pup knew he was being duped, and thought the treat looked ‘suspicious’ in aTikTok video that reached over , people.He cautiously licks the whipped cream, but certainly isn’t sure about the imposter puppuccino before deciding it ‘tastes funny’. His owner then scoops the cream into their trusty Starbucks cup, adding extra cream with ‘aerosol cream sound effects for extra convincing’, before presenting it to the pup.Fetch. Chase. Eat. Sleep. Repeat. is a new podcast from TeamDogs which takes a sideways look at what itaposs REALLY like bringing puppies into your le.Every week hosts Hannah Jones and Karen Price will be joined by celebrity dog owners like Strictly Come Dancingaposs Shirley Ballas and Coronation Street actress Samia Longchambon to chew over the adventures - and misadventures! - of puppy parenting.

Dashcam footage was caught by Plymouth man Cody Hugill, who was driving towards the junction of Underwood Road in Plympton on Wednesday evening. The video shows Cody driving up to the road and stopping as he sees the man walking the German Shepherd type breed, whilst behind the wheel.  In the footage, a man can be seen driving his car whilst holding the lead of his dog out of the window and going at a slow speed uphill for the animal to keep up. The car carries on driving up the road and out of sight, with pedestrians and drivers in a state of confusion. Shocked Cody told PlymouthLive: It was a light night, and I had to do a bit of a double takeIaposm honest. I was just travelling down the road and watching them, and even a couple of passersby turned their heads. Then as he drove up the road I wasnapost able to follow him completely, but heaposd gone on for a while at least. It is not the only strange antics recently by pet owners that have left onlookers speechless, with an owl seen being taken for a walk in Glasgow. A man was spotted casually strolling down a road holding an owl in footage that has gone viral with the bizarre video being likened to the Harry Potter films.

Early years Prince Andrew and Sarah had been friends since they were children but it wasnapost until  that they started dating after being seated together at Royal Ascot that year.They got engaged nine months later on February ,  - his th birthday - and Andrew gave his we-to-be a ruby engagement ring. Their wedding was a grand affair at Westminster Abbey and they shared a kiss on the balcony of Buckingham Palace like Prince Charles and Princess Diana before them. In the early days of their romance, Fergie bonded with the Queen over their shared love of horses, according to Vanity Fair.It was also reported that she won over Prince Philip with her sharp sense of humour and the interest she showed in her father-in-lawaposs favourite sport of carriage driving.Split from Andrew Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.After their wedding, the couple welcomed two daughters - Princess Beatrice in  and Princess Eugenie in .But cracks had begun to appear in their relationship as Andrewaposs naval career saw him away from the family for long periods of time. And in  they split with their orce finalised in . Speaking to US TV host Ernie Manouse in , Sarah spoke about palace courtiers, who she said made her le dficult. She explained: “My deal was that I was marrying my man, who happened to be a prince and a naval officer. “But what I got was not the man, I got the palace and didn’t get him... and the courtiers told me I had to go to Buckingham Palace and he had to go to sea. “For our marriage, I saw him  days a year.” Livid royals  Despite splitting from Andrew, Fergie was still invited to join the family for their traditional summer holiday in Balmoral in . However, the politeness disappeared on one excruciatingly embarrassing moment when intimate photos of her appeared on the front pages. She had been snapped having her toes sucked by her financial advisor, Texan millionaire John Bryan. Other photos in the set also showed the couple kissing, embracing and frolicking in the pool and they appeared in newspapers.And while at Balmoral, Fergie had to walk into breakfast that morning while the family all looked at the pictures. Speaking on Channel aposs documentary, Fergie Vs Diana: Royal Wives at War, royal expert Jennie Bond said: There she was, with all the members of the royal family, who traditionally have all the papers laid out on the breakfast table. The scene when she went into the dining room was horrendous because there were her brothers-in-law turning over the pages and staring at her naked top half of her body. It was excruciatingly embarrassing and she went to the Queen, and the Queen was livid. She was absolutely furious with Sarah. Prince Philip rt  One royal who was said to be especially furious with the toe sucking pictures was the late Prince Philip.His biographer Gyles Brandreth once said Philip thought Sarah was simply beyond the pale and gave her a wide berthBrandreth claimed the Duke of Edinburgh decided that aposenough was enoughapos and that he didnapost want anything more to do with her.He told MailOnline : When I asked him [Prince Philip] why he wouldn’t see Sarah, he said: ‘I am not vindictive.’Then, looking at me directly, he added emphatically: ‘I am not vindictive, but I don’t see the point.’ The pair are said to have not met for  years, with Fergie banished from ­Balmoral each summer before Philip arrived. Diana feud It wasnapost just Prince Philip that Sarah stopped talking to - she also had a falling out with her friend Princess Diana.In the early years of their marriages, Diana and Fergie had a close bond. They were often pictured chatting at events, such as Ascot, and took their children on skiing holidays together with Fergie frequently describing Diana as her best friend. But itaposs thought that in  the pairaposs relationship became strained and at the time of Dianaaposs tragic death a year later, they were not on speaking terms.According to the Daily Mail, the reason stemmed back to Sarahaposs autobiography, My Story, released in .Before it was published, Diana is reported to have told her former sister-in-law not to include any gossip about her in it. But Sarah included an unflattering anecdote, saying she got a verruca after wearing a pair of shoes she borrowed from Diana - causing the rt. William wedding snub In , Fergie was snubbed from the royal wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge after being unceremoniously left off the guest list.The wedding came a year after she was caught up in a sting set up by a journalist in which she appeared to ask for and accept , in cash in exchange for access to her ex-husband Prince Andrew.Speaking to Town and Country Magazine she said: I didn’t think I was probably worthy to go to their wedding. I took myself to Thailand, actually, to be far away from it so that I could try and heal.”But she bore no ill will towards her nephew William and said previously: I think Diana would be so proud of her son... I really love the feeling that Diana and I both werenapost there. Harryaposs invitationHowever, by the time Williamaposs younger brother Prince Harry married Meghan Markle in , the tide had begun to turn.And Fergie did bag an invite to the big day - marking ato the royal fold. In later years, she of course took her place alongside he royals at the weddings of Beatrice and Eugenie. Balmoral Despite Fergieaposs frosty relationship with Prince Philip, she is said to have remained on good terms with the Queen. And this year she appeared to be back in the royal inner circle by spending time with Her Majesty and other royals at Balmoral. According to royal expert Angela Levin, this made Fergie happy and feel assheaposs back in the crowd. Praise for the Queen And showing her gratitude to the Queen, Sarah has given her some high praise indeed. Speaking on the Tea with Twiggy podcast earlier this year, she said she admires the way Her Majesty is so modern and flexible. She said: I think to myself that honestly my mother-in-law has been more of a mother to me than my mother. I absolutely think there is no greater mentor because from a little girl to now, the consistency of Her Majesty has been a great honour and makes me want to cry.

The man, whose identity has not been made public, was held in a darkened room and fed sporadically, the Carabinieri police said. He was able to use some kind of code to tell his family he was being held hostage while calling them with the ransom request, it has been reported. They then contacted the police who located the -year-old in Monte San Giusto, near the city of Macerata in central Italy,  hours later. On Wednesday afternoon Italian police said they surrounded the apartment of the alleged kidnappers - who had demanded €,for his release - before safely securing the Brit.  Yesterday the Italian force said that the young man had been on holiday in Italy when he was kidnapped. Three of his alleged kidnappers were Italian, while the fourth was Moroccan. They were reportedly arrested and remanded in custody in a prison near the city of Ancona. The young manaposs release was secured via a joint operation between the Carabinieri and the National Crime Agency. It is unclear why the amount of money demanded was relatively small, given the wealth of the British manaposs family.His family, who are fairly wealthy, received a message from him and contacted the British police and the NCA, who in turn contacted the Carabinieri, Colonel Nicola Candido, who was also involved in the operation, said, thereported. Within  hours, we had located the apartment in which he was being held prisoner. The raid took place at  on Wednesday. We surrounded the apartment block, arrested the captors, and released the hostage. The British man had been in Italy since June, he said. Colonel Massimiliano Mengasini, who was also involved in the operation, said the man was found in a darkened room with furniture pushed up against the wall. The man was exhausted but slowly recovering, he added. Sean Kelly, operations manager for the NCA’s Anti Kidnap and Extortion Unit , said: “We have been working closely with the Italian authorities since the kidnap of a British man was reported. “NCA officers in Italy and specialists from AKEU, working together with UK policing, have been providing close support to the Carabinieri Police as part of its ongoing investigation. “We are pleased that this incident has been resolved successfully.”  Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Crime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She was desperate tohome to the Philippines to visit her sick mother, but her employer had taken her passport and not paid her in weeks. She was working day and night as a domestic worker and surviving on the children’s leftovers. Her employer relentlessly verbally abused her. “I had no time off, it wasn’t allowed,” she says. “I just had to work  hours a day. Sometimes I would sleep only two to three hours. I’m not allowed to use my mobile, they shout at meI try to talk to anyone. They told me not to say I am tired.” The family were visiting England for Christmas from their home in Dubai when Justina asked her employer’s mother-in-law for a scrap of food. “I was just so hungry,” she says. “The mother of the Mister said ‘she must have some food’. My employer went mad, she grabbed me by the neck. She said, ‘how dare you ask my mother-in-law for food!’ “I said ‘sorry madame, because I am hungry madame’.” “She said ‘shame on you, you f***ing’, all the bad words. She shouted at me from pm until  in the morning. I think I have to escape, or I will die here.”Have you been a victim of modern slavery  Email webnews@mirror to tell your story Justina managed to escape her employer and was eventually granted legal status in the UK under Modern Slavery laws. The Modern Slavery Act is one of the Conservative government’s cornerstone immigration reforms – and is often used as cover for the Tories’ anti-migrant policies. But now even these protections are under threat, under Priti Patel’s Nationality and Borders Bill. Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner Dame Sara Thornton is among those who have warned the plans “will make the identication of victims of Modern Slavery harder and will create additional vulnerabilities”. Perversely for a Bill which the Home Secretary claims is all about ending the misery of trafficking, Thornton adds that the reforms “could signicantly undermine our ability to bring traffickers to justice”. Meanwhile, Caroline Haughey QC, who helped draft the legislation, says “sadly the bill undermines all the efforts, and I do think achievements, made with the Modern Slavery Act.” Justina had taken the job in Dubai as a domestic to help her elderly parents in the Philippines, retired farm-workers who needed medical care. Speaking ahead of Anti-Slavery Day on Monday, she tells me she planned to send money home for an operation for her mum’s eye cancer – but her employers regularly failed to pay her. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletterThe abuse that Justina faced led her to the brink of a breakdown, and she becomes distressed as she speaks. “I cannot breathe,” she says. “I am so scared. I am worried I am going crazy.” In London, she spent hours sitting outside restaurants in the cold waiting for her rich employers to finish eating inside. “But how can I escape, I have no friends in the UK  Then, I think ‘God will guide me’.” Justina escaped the night her employer tried to strangle her. “I didn’t sleep all night,” she says. “At am, I walked out in only my clothes. I am crying and crying. I am alone, it is Christmas and very cold. I am walking until the sun comes up. I don’t have any money because they haven’t paid me even though I begged them, ‘please my parents aren’t well and they need the money for medicines’.”  Justina was eventually taken in by a kind passer-by who took her to hospital. “I was shaking all the time. I think someone will kill me,” she says. “I am crying day and night and I have stopped eating. In the hospital they gave me medicine to calm down.” The hospital encouraged her to contact the police and the anti-trafficking charity Kalayaan. Its name means ‘Freedom’ in Filipino. The police told her that her employer had put out a Missing Persons report for her but that she did not need toto them. With Kalayaan’s help, Justina eventually won a long battle for Leave To Remain in the UK, using a framework called the National Referral Mechanism . Campaigners say the Borders Bill will adversely affect cases like Justina’s in a number of ways, but the most dangerous is that it reduces the amount of time a survivor has to come forward. In Justina’s case this took a long time, and she remains clearly terried. Kalayaan says this shorter timeframe just isn’t realistic, and that the Home Office will be allowed to turn away survivors before they even get to the NRM. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The UK is a world leader in identying and supporting genuine victims of modern slavery, and this will continue. However, over recent years we have seen an increase in the number of illegal migrants and foreign criminals seeking modern slavery referrals – enabling them to frustrate their removal from our country. “The changes we are making through the Bill seek to ensure we can identy genuine victims as early as possible and ensure they receive appropriate support, while reducing any opportunities for the system to be misused.” Justina fights on for other victims. “Kalayaan helped me fight to be allowed to stay safely in the UK,” she says. “I can breathe again. Even so, I am always dreaming of being trapped. Now more people will be trapped in that situation. It’s not good for human rights. They should be ashamed. It’s not fair.” The Nationality and Borders Bill, due to become law next spring, is the most aggressive piece of anti-refugee legislation since Britain signed the Geneva Convention in . On Wednesday [th Oct], refugees and supporters will gather to oppose it in Parliament Square. Meanwhile, as the Bill makes its way through Parliament, Anti-Slavery Day on Monday will take on a new, modern, urgency.Kalayaan - www.kalayaan.org.uk Refugees Welcome Rally - .-.pm on Wednesday, October , in Parliament Square, London.

Mistakes at Amyaposs Fish and Chips in Darfield, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire resulted in ideal conditions for food positioning bacteria to grow, inspectors said.Cooked food was left outside to cool down and ingredients were even stored on the floor of the takeaway, YorkshireLive reports.The shop kept a tray of ribs cooling in a warm oven and left raw fish in a washing up bowl in a fridge which was warmer than it should have been. Despite the countless errors, employees were unfazed by the horric conditions and showed little understanding of the risk this may pose. The business said that while it agreed with the remarks from Barnsley politan Borough Council, a number of improvements have been made since the inspection on July . However, the chip shop has been slapped with a zero-star food hygiene rating by the Food Standards Agency- the lowest possible grade. Officials carried out a full food hygiene rating at the chip shop in School Street, Darfield, and filed a troubling report. Among the most concerning findings were the shocking conditions in which food was kept. Food was being stored on the floor of the main cooking area and was at risk of bacterial contamination, said the inspector. The picture above shows bowls of food lying on the floor as a member of staff works nearby. Food was also found being prepared and stored outside, posing further risks to customers, while cooked rice was left out to cool at room temperature. Once food was cooked, it was sometimes left in the danger zone. The inspector spotted a tray of ribs cooling in a warm oven on their visit, which presented the ideal conditions for food positioning bacteria. There was a general lack of cleaning... and hand washing from staff, storage containers were damaged and dirty and there were not even enough cleaning supplies in the building. One area of particular concern was the risk of cross-contamination.  Raw meat was being prepared next to cooked food which was about to be served. The conditions didnapost appear to improve in the fridges either. Here, raw meat and prepared food were stored on the same shelves. The temperature of the fridge - where raw fish was kept in a washing up bowl - was .°C, almost °C warmer than FSA recommendations. Raw meat was also stored unwrapped in freezers, while the lid to one of the chest freezers at the chip shop did not close properly. You must not prepare food for customers who declare they have a food allergy as you are unable to safely prepare food for them to eliminate risk from... cross-contamination, said the inspector. One of the most startling pictures is of the chopping boards at Amyaposs Fish and Chips. These were used by staff for prepared food, but the images show how they are covered in black grime.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Chopping boards used for the preparation of ready to eat food items were found to be in a filthy condition, said the report. Remarkably, staff told inspectors this was acceptable and showed little understanding of the risk this may pose. The problems didnapost end there though. The thermometer probe was dirty, but it appears as though the staff didnapost use it anyway. Instead, they simply copied temperature records from previous entries, rather than actually checking the food.  The report added that most of the issues highlighted in the  inspection were also found during previous visits and little progress had been made. The hygiene and safety standards noted on this inspection fall well below those expected, it concluded. Since the inspection, Amyaposs Fish and Chips have filed a brief update to FSA. They claim the premises have been thoroughly cleaned and procedures are now in place to ensure that cleanliness is maintained. The owner has also stated that staff have been trained   re-trained and are under better supervision and a new Food Safety Management system has been introduced.

Each morning the exasperated caterer sees two or three doggers while sheaposs helping lorry drivers to refuel, Yorkshire Live reported. She claims the men come aposfrom Manchesterapos and sometimes so many people turn up thereaposs no room for lorry drivers to park in the layby. If you came and had breakfast at our cafe youaposd see two or three doggers, guaranteed, she said.  Most people think itaposs funny but itaposs actually really seedy. Sharon claims that the wood behind her cafe is littered with condoms and old mattresses that are used for people to have sex on. She says she has repeatedly reported the issue to her local MP and the police, and now feels she needs to warn walkers in the area.  She said: If it were a female and male dogging site, Iaposd feel exactly the same - that just doesnapost come in to it, itaposs the fact that itaposs a dogging site. Thereaposs a hotel  yards up the road, Iaposm sure they would appreciate the business. Itaposs massive. The truckers who do manage to park there on a night get propositioned, they knock on the cab and say aposdya fancy a bit apos She added: The main thing Iaposd love to do is for truckers to be able to park. They come in depressed, theyaposre away from their families and they want a warm meal.  Obviously I donapost come to work for the fun of it, we lost my mum in the beginning of Covid and we opened about a week after we lost her. To see it come to nothing because people canapost come in itaposs terrible - itaposs just soul destroying. But then again the truckers, the plight that they have at the minute, theyaposre not getting the jobs because the conditions are so bad and then to not be able to get in for a meal... Sharon has started a petition calling on local councils to crack down on people using lay-bys to park their car all day.

The loving father had been tormented for more than a decade by the horrendous murder of his daughter, Meredith - with key questions surrounding the infamous case remaining unanswered to this day. In January last year, the -year-old died in hospital after being found in the road near his Croydon home with two fractured legs, a broken arm and a head injury.In yet another cruel blow to his family, this week a coroner said he was unable to sayJohn was killed in a hit-and-run - with police unable to establish why he was on the road.In a book about Meredithaposs murder, the grief-stricken dad spoke movingly about the stark possibility the Kerchers may never know what happened in her final hours. This is how the family was rocked by the murder trial and subsequent acquittal that made headlines around the world - and why they have a complicated relationship with Meredithaposs exonerated flatmate, Amanda Knox. aposBeautul, caringapos daughter stabbed  times Described by her father as beautul, intelligent and caring, Meredith - from Coulsdon, Surrey - was murdered on November , , during an exchange trip to Italy. Sickeningly, the -year-oldaposs body was found with  stab wounds on the bedroom floor of her apartment in Perugia. Her throat had been cut and an autopsy revealed evidence of sexual assault. John, who was a national newspaper journalist, later recalled how he first discovered his daughter was dead after ringing up a news desk to find out about reports of a British student killed in Perugia.I drop the phone. I do not believe it, he wrote in the Daily Mail.There has to be a mistake. I refuse to let the facts sink in. I repeat it over and over to myself: ‘Not beautul Meredith... Not beautul Meredith.apos  In a case that became a media storm, Meredithaposs housemate Amanda Knox was twice convicted and twice acquitted of her murder and spent four years in prison along with her former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito. Another man, Rudy Guede, was also convicted of murder and was released in December last year after serving a -year sentence. Explaining the sensational acquittal, court adviser Gennaro Marasca said none of the evidence demonstrated that either Knox or Sollecito was present at the crime scene. He added that no biological traces ... could be attributed to them in the room of the murder or on the body of the victim, where in contrast numerous traces were found attributable to Guede.Familyaposs torment over aposstark possibilityapos of never seeing justiceIn the years since, Knox, , has furiously slammed the handling of the case and her utterly unjustied treatment. The Kerchers, meanwhile, have kept a lower profile as they struggle to get answers over what really happened the night Meredith was murdered.  Speaking on the tenth anniversary of her death, sister Stephanie said the pain and helplessness never ceases.She told MailOnline : It is dficult to come terms with not knowing exactly what happened that night, as whether you believe the guilt or innocence of the accused there are still contradictions and discrepancies in the judgeaposs summary.Nor have we heard anything more of a further investigation into who  they think may have been involved. Rudy Guede ... was convicted on the basis that he did not act alone, however, with no one  on trial or convicted it does of course raise questions for us as a family and anyone following the case. In his memoir, Meredith: Our Daughter’s Murder And The Heartbreaking Quest For The Truth, John revealed his pain that the courtroom drama had overshadowed the le of his little girl. In a moving portrait, he paid tribute to her jokes, her wicked one-liners and her laughter - revealing how following his orce from we Arline in , he was comforted by a voicemail from Meredith singing Whitney Houston’s I Will Always Love You down the phone. Yet the familyaposs torment was still painfully raw. We are still waiting for justice for our daughter and sister, he wrote. [We] have to face up to the stark possibility that we might never have a satisfactory picture of what unfolded in Perugia on that terrible November night. In the summer of , John suffered a stroke which he speculated could have been related to the stress of the criminal investigation and draining trips to Italy. Last January, he was found yards from his front door collapsed on the pavement. Scotland Yard initially said John died in a suspected hit-and-run, but later said he had died of a fall. An inquest into John’s death heard the freelance journalist was found by passers-by near his home in Croydon, south London, on a “dark, wet and windy” night in mid-January last year. He was “conscious but confused” and did not know why he was on the ground, the court heard. A Kercher family spokesman said at the time of John’s death: “We loved him dearly and he is going to be very sorely missed.” Knoxaposs aposcomplicatedapos relationship with Kerchers The Kerchersapos search for answers has at times brought them into conflict with Knox, with relatives slamming her inappropriate behaviour following her acquittal.The American has built up a huge media profile - releasing a memoir that reportedly earned her £.million, taking part in a Netflix documentary about the case and most recently hosting a series of podcasts including The Truth About True Crime. In , she ed to Italy to participate in a conference about wrongful convictions, sparking a rare statement from the Kerchers branding her actions inappropriate and very painful.The Kerchers’ lawyer, Francesco Maresca, told the: “All these insistences and appearances are only ever done to keep the attention on herself.“The murder is a tragic memory for the Kercher family, they lost their daughter and sister in such a terrible way. It’s also an injustice for them as they still don’t know the full truth.” He added of her involvement in the conference: “It’s unjustied because her process was not a classic case of ‘judicial error’. There was a swing in the decisions: some judges decided one way, and others in another way.” Previously Knox has said she would like to meet the Kercher family and visit Meredithaposs grave - but was warned by sister Stephanie to stay away. She is currently pregnant with her first child with husband Christopher Robinson after suffering a miscarriage in May. Speaking to RTÉ Radio  in August, Knox admitted she has kept her distance from Meredithaposs parents, saying: “To this day, I can’t tell youthey know that I’m innocent or not.”  Given the fact that I don’t know that fact, I also understand that me even approaching them is a potential cause of great distress to their family and a dredging up of terrible memories.”She added: “I understand that the Kerchers have gone through an incredibly traumatic journey, not just from the tragic loss of Meredith but also through the incredibly confusing trial that they had to experience and go through and the feeling of being denied a sense of closure because of the outcome of the case. “Given that understanding, I also know that they have a complicated relationship with me.” Comment MORE ON Meredith KercherAmanda KnoxRudy GuedeRaffaele SollecitoMurder\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The force released audio footage to remind people that their  service is for emergencies only.Police made the recording public as part of their Think Before You Dial campaign - but some said shaming an aposelderlyapos man wasnapost the way to deal with the situation.In the two-minute call, the man - whose voice has been disguised - said: This is an odd thing to put to you, but I bought a chicken yesterday from Tesco. What do you think to this story  Have your say in the comments  I put it straight in the fridge without opening the bag. I opened it and the smell from it is absolutely disgusting. Itaposs putrid. I donapost know what to do with it, can you advise me  Despite being repeatedly told the matter was between him and the supermarket, he continued to ask for help - tying up a  call handler for more than two minutes. There is nothing the police are going to be able to do with it, Iaposm afraid. This is a civil matter between you and Tesco, the operator said.  But the man didnapost hang up, he continued to ask for police assistance. If I paid for the petrol, could you not send a car out for me , he asked. The handler replied: No unfortunately, we are dealing with crimes at the moment. Itaposs not under our remit for us to come and collect a rotting chicken. The call ended soon after. But Thames Valley Police followers on social media have hit back at the force, claiming the caller could have dementia. This is CLEARLY anelderly person that needs help.

It’s not just Halloween when G.H.O.S.Tdeal with ghastly ghouls, it’s an all year round job. The private paranormal investigators have always had a strong interest in ghosts after founder Craig believed he saw and felt the spirit of his grandfather. Craig was only  at the time, and that’s when his intrigue with the afterle really began. He said: “When I was younger, myself and a couple of friends went to locations to try and experience things. “It kind of escalated from there, we started looking at some of the most haunted locations across the country and around the world. “I decided to incorporate a team and we built on that from there.” It’s not just ghost hunting that Craig and his team get up to though, they even have their very own aposhaunted museum.apos The museum contains eerie artefacts that visitors can look at for themselves, with many of people experiencing some strange encounters. Craig continued: “We’ve got a worldwide audience, and over lockdown we’ve had some strange artefacts that were in peopleaposs houses originally. “I’ve thought about doing something like this for  to  years and over lockdown we got so much stuff that we decided to do it. “People absolutely love it, it’s great for the city of Stoke-on-Trent.” Although spooky encounters are all part of the job for Craig, he does recall some particularly creepy moments. He said: “We went to one location near Liverpool where a woman claimed she was possessed. That was quite daunting. “The young lady still speaks with us via social media today, she often interacts with us.”  Perhaps the creepiest thing from their haunted museum has to be the haunted doll “Mary”, who has made many visitors feel uncomfortable. Craig said: “Mary is definitely the most haunted doll in the United Kingdom, a lady in Stafford gave us this doll who was given to her by an elderly lady for her children. “She didn’t feel comfortable with this doll, so gave it to us. It’s been in our possession for about a year now. “She’s rocked on a chair, she’s thrown herself out of the chair, she’s even moved her eyes from the right to the centre. The previous owner had even experienced issues with her car on the way to give the doll to G.H.O.S.T, which they believe was all caused by Mary. “Mary is definitely one of the most haunted artefacts we’ve had, but we also had a couple who saw a Victorian baby walker move in front of them. “We had two members of a band come to visit us last week and they said they saw the baby walker do the exact same thing. There is also a Victorian séance room in the museum.  Craig said: “We have an amazing paranormal team that help run the museum, Gemma Boote, Caroline Birchall, Lucy Longson, Justine Farley, Sam Walters. “We also offer haunted sleepovers from pm in the evening, we give you a full tour of the museum and artefacts, an investigation of the museum, seances and table tipping spirit board sessions.” During the sleepover, visitors get the chance to visit their very own chapel at around am, and have the option to sleep overthey want to. Craig continued: “We’ve had a few sleepovers here, one group almost lasted the whole evening. “You get to sleep in a body bagyou want to, and there is so much activity - from loud footsteps, moving curtains, and the giggles of a little girl.”All of the experiences can be seen on the museumaposs YouTube channel, the team also do regular Facebook lives on their page.Craig concluded: “We offer a genuine ultimate experience all under one haunted location where you can investigate yourself.” For funeral notices in your area visit funeral-notices Comment MORE ON YouTubeMuseumsFrisk\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She says this meant that she couldnapost even breastfeed her daughter, Willow, now two, as they would have covered her face and suffocated her. The mum has also had issues with other women and men, who sexualise her because of her breast. The -year-old is now a JJ in cup size and desperate for breast reduction surgery because she hates her boobs so much. Have you got a story that you think we should feature  Email us at webnews@mirror Elizabeth said: My boobs havenapost stopped growing since I was a  year old child and obviously my boobs grew even bigger during my pregnancy.I really wanted to breastfeed my daughter because I thought it would be an amazing way to bond, but my boobs were just too big.My breasts are so big that they entirely covered Willowaposs whole face and she would have just suffocated underneath them.It was really upsetting because it was something Iaposd really wanted to try but I just couldnapost.Even now the size of my boobs affects the stuff I can do with Willow.I have to carry her above my boobs as I canapost carry her on my hips because my boobs are in the way.I canapost even hug her properly, she has to be above my boobs in order to hug me back.And because of the constant and severe back pain caused by the size of my boobs, I canapost really run around after her and play with her.When Elizabeth reached her twenties and realised her boobs were still growing she began to hate them.She struggled to find bras that would fit her and doubled up on sports brasshe was going to exercise.As she has continued to get older, Elizabeth says she still gets growing pains in her boobs now and that she thinks theyaposre still growing.As a young teenager it was quite cool, but Iaposm  now and theyaposre still growing, she said. I get a lot of hate from women, I have lost female friends. And I get abusive stuff from males because they see them and they think that is all I am.She added: I am sure my boobs are still growing because I am still going up in cup sizes. I am now bursting out of bras that fit me a couple of months ago.As I have gotten older my boobs have gotten heavier, they hurt more and they are blotchy purple where the strain of the weight has stretched the skin so thin. I hate them. I have a bad back all of the time and the physically hurt to touch which obviously affects my time with my husband, Richard, . It feels like shooting electricity.I have to be very careful when I am cooking over the stove so that I donapost burn them which I have done a few times previously. They just get in the way of everything.I also only buy baggy clothes now to hide away becauseI wore anything where you can slightly see my boobs I get disgusting attention from men and people just stare at them.I have even been called a aposslagapos before while wearing a turtle neck. I canapost win.Elizabeth canapost buy bras from high street brands, she has to specically search online for underwear that will fit her ever-growing boobs.The bras that she has to buy cost her between £ to £.Elizabeth has been turned away multiple times by NHS doctors for a breast reduction as they have just told her to lose weight.However, she says that no matter her weight her boobs are always big.Elizabeth, a stay-at-home-mum, added: No matter my weight I have always had large boobs, even when I was  stone I still had large boobs.My weight fluctuates, as most womenaposs does, but my boobs have just kept growing. I went from  stone G to  stone with H - they just kept growing despite my weight loss.So I have taken matters into my own hands and I am trying to raise the money for the surgery myself.It would completely change my le.People seem to think itaposs a good thing to have big boobs but it is not at all.I even struggle to sleep. I canapost lie on my back as theyaposre too heavy, I canapost lie on my front as itaposs too painful.I have to lie on my sides and even then I have to physically position my breasts with my hands.Iaposd love to just do simple things like chase my daughter around and wear halter neck tops.Comment MORE ON NHSPregnancyBack painCosmetic surgeryPlastic surgeryTeenagersFitnessBoobsBreastfeeding\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Sam Hornby, a mum of two, was set the task of creating a Ravenclaw common room by her nine-year-old son when they moved into their new home in Rossendale, Lancashire, in February. His requests even included making the ceiling look like the one from the Great Hall at Hogwarts and the incredible final result looks like something straight out of the film franchise. It includes stone-look walls, candles floating from the ceiling, a chest of drawers painted to look like a stack of trunks used by Harry and his classmates, and plenty of trinkets from the school of witchcraft and wizardry.

Sam, who works as a swimming teacher, says she bought everything she needed from Ikea, The Works and Etsy to pull off the incredible transformation, costing her £ altogether. The -year-old said: My son is a Harry Potter fan and a proud Ravenclaw. He had a Harry Potter room in our old house and so when we moved in February , he asked for me to recreate it, but wanted it to be solely a Ravenclaw common room and not Harry Potter in general. He also askedI was able to make it look like the ceiling of the Great Hall, so the ideas came from him really. Once the room was prepped, Sam said she found an image of the crest her son wanted on the ceiling, and cut it into a cardboard box, using her phone torch to project the crest upwards to use as guidance as she painted it on. She said: Once this was done, I added a picture rail, wallpapered the brick wallpaper, brought the paint down onto the wallpaper to create the illusion my son wanted and then my husband and I did the fibre optics cables in the ceiling - all  of them. It is handy having an electrician for a husband as he also did the wall lights.I painted the IKEA drawers to look like suitcases, printed out labels for the bottles, got old hardback books from a charity shop and printed out the first year reading books from Google Images and added owls and other bits.The shrunken head was crocheted by me, and the Fawkes Phoenix was also crocheted by me from a Crafty Intentions pattern on Etsy. The candles are suspended by transparent thread, a pin hammered into the ceiling and a blob of paint to conceal the pinhead.  “The plaster cost £, the carpet was £, the paint was £, the picture rail was £, the fibre optic lights were £ and the candles cost £. We already had the furniture and the bottles were empty alcohol bottles gted by friends.” Sam said she was thrilled to bits with how it turned out and was even more delighted when she saw her sonaposs stunned reaction. His smile was so big and he was a little overwhelmed as he hadnapost seen it, she said. He last saw it before we started any of the decorating and painting and had been in the spare room. My biggest tip for others who want to recreate this look is actually taken from Mural Joe who is on YouTube. “He has a video that shows you how to comfortably paint a ceiling by rolling up a fleece blanket, putting it round your back, under your arms and then tying it behind your head - it stops any neck ache. My other tip is to shop around as it doesnapost have to cost too much. Buy paint cheap, spend £ a tube at most. And most importantly, take your time to prepare. This includes filling holes and so on, but also get lots of images as references for what you are wanting to paint. Do your research. To be able to completely personalise a room for £, and achieve the dream for my son, is actually priceless.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Harry PotterHousing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

PCR swabs from a number of testing sites have been ing negative results to people who had the virus due to errors at a major laboratory in the Midlands. The public have now been told to get retested while close contacts with symptoms are also advised to get a PCR check. It is the latest controversy around the bungled NHS Test and Trace programme which has seen the Government hand multimillion contracts to private firms to run much of the system. Immensa Health was handed a £ million contract and runs a laboratory in Wolverhampton which health officials said gave , people incorrect results between September  and October . Have you been impacted by unreliable testing at the lab  Email webnews@mirror  Most of these results were for people in South West England, prompting fears of spike in the region. Dr Will Welfare, incident director at the UK Health Security Agency, said: “We have recently seen a rising number of positive lateral flow test results subsequently testing negative on PCR. “As a result of our investigation, we are working with NHS Test and Trace and the company to determine the laboratory technical issues which have led to inaccurate PCR results being issued to people. We have immediately suspended testing at this laboratory while we continue the investigation.” Dr Kit Yates, expert at the University of Bath, said: “There’s been a concerted effort to highlight what’s been going on with these strange results for a while now in the hope that someone would investigate. “We now know , people are believed to have been given  negatives, but this doesn’t even come near to the cost of the mistake.  “Many of these people will have been forced into school or work potentially infecting others. This could be part of the reason behind some of the recent rises we’ve seen.” The testing site had previously made headlines after staff were filmed fighting, sleeping, fighting and rolling around on the floor. The contract was handed to Immensa without a standard tender process and according to Companies House the firm only appears to have existed since May just after the start of the pandemic. Andrea Riposati, CEO of Immensa Health Clinic Ltd, said: “We are fully collaborating with UKHSA on this matter. “Quality is paramount for us. We have proudly analysed more than . million samples for NHS Test and Trace.  “We do not wish this matter or anything  to tarnish the amazing work done by the UK in this pandemic.” West Berkshire Council released a statement calling on those who used its Newbury Showground testing site to book another PCR check. The mass testing site in Chieveley, West Berkshire, is one of those affected by the errors at the Immensa lab.  It said Newbury Showground “had results sent out that may have incorrectly shown as negative for Covid-”. It continued: “After receiving reports from local residents in recent weeks that there were concerns about the accuracy of test results from the site, we passed these concerns onto the DHSC for further investigation. “The DHSC has now confirmed that a number of sites nationally may have been affected by this issue, including the one at Newbury Showground.” Those who received a negative result for a PCR test between October  and , as well as their close contacts, were “strongly” encouraged by the local authority to take another test. Dr Welfare, of the UK Has, added: “There is no evidence of any faults with lateral flow tests or PCR test kits themselves and the public should remain confident in using them and in other laboratory services currently provided. “If you get a positive LFD test, it’s important to make sure that you then get a follow up PCR test to confirm you have COVID-. “If you have symptoms of COVID-, self-isolate and take a PCR test.

Lyra Cassell, , from Allerton, Liverpool, found a lump in her groin at the end of August and asked to see a doctor. Her mum, Hayley, says they were told the lump was a hernia, and that they could not get a hospital appointment for months due to an NHS backlog that has been caused by the pandemic.Hayley told the Liverpool Echo : She had a hernia as a baby so we thought it was nothing to worry about. Then we went for a walk in Garston Park and she went aposIaposve got this lump on my neck.apos It was on the side of her neck and it was quite big. I thought aposthataposs not right Lyraapos and I phoned the doctors again. Following her second appointment with a nurse, Lyra was referred for an appointment the hospital and a few days later she had her bloods taken by her GP. Hayley said: [The doctor] phoned me on the Tuesday morning to tell me she was anaemic and to stop giving her sweets and fizzy drinks. They said sheaposs not diabetic but her blood sugar levels are slightly high. However, two weeks later, Lyra went for an ultrasound appointment followed by a biopsy and further blood tests, and on September  received the devastating news that she had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. She started receiving chemotherapy the next day. Mum Hayley said: Everything was going well for her. The fit and healthy Belvedere Academy student had recently smashed her GCSEs and was running five times a week for the Liverpool Harriers And Athletic Club. Hayley, , said: [Lyra] works in Ginoaposs restaurant in town part-time on the reception and she also taught dance in Liverpool College to four- year olds, so she was really busy and she was loving it. She was saying she was tired but we just put it down to working and going out with her friends. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is a type of cancer that affects white blood cells. It progresses quickly and aggressively and requires immediate treatment.  Hayley said: Lyraaposs first question was aposwill I lose my hair apos They explained to us that it will be a very dficult process of at least two years. It feels like itaposs someone  this has happened to - this doesnapost happen to us. Itaposs just horrendous. Two weeks ago I had a normal, and what we thought was a healthy teenager, ready to smash her A-levels and go out clubbing and do all the things we did as a   year old, and now everything is a train wreck. Lyra is currently undergoing treatment and has recently been diagnosed with steroid-induced diabetes. If Lyra hadnapost found the lump on her neck when she did, Hayley fears how long it would have been before she found out she had cancer. With this in mind, Hayley is keen to raise awareness and encourage others to get checked out at the first sign of symptoms.In a bid to help the family during this time, Lyraaposs running coach and family friend Jayne Teare has set up a Go Fund Me page.In a message on the page Jayne said: Lyra’s unique love of le and people shines through with most people she meets. She is warm, funny, goofy, caring, determined and very kind. She and her family are terried by what this new future holds and the upset it will have on Lyra and her loved ones. The journey will be long and dficult but we have to focus on the light at the end of the tunnel. Currently, le for Lyra is tough as she undergoes extensive chemotherapy and deals with the complications that this can cause. Any support or help you can offer would be greatly appreciated.

Dad Thomas Hughes, , and step-mum Emma Tustin, , are accused of mistreating Arthur Labinjo-Hughes before he suffered an un-survivable brain injury at his home in Cranmore Road, Solihull, West Midlands, on June  .The young boy died in hospital in the early hours of the following day, Birmingham Mail reported. Hughes and Tustin both deny murder. Yesterday in court on the sixth day of the trial jurors were played CCTV footage taken in the living room of the family home on June , when Arthur allegedly endured the fatal injury.  They were also shown texts between the Hughes and Tustin from that day, including a photo sent from the woman in which Arthur appears to be crying. From the home Tustin texted Hughes, who was out at the shops, multiple times, writing that the boy was grabbing walls and door and throwing himself down just before pm. They discussed whether a mark on his face was bruising before Tustin sent Hughes an audio clip of Arthur crying followed by a text saying: Still at it. The prosecution showed a clip of the woman leaving the living room for about a minute, during which time they contend she dealt Arthur the fatal blow. Jonas Hankin QC told the court that around this time Tustin texted the aposballoon ladyapos about her birthday decorations for an upcoming party. At .pm Tustin messaged Hughes: Just copped me in the stomach he has thrown himself all over the floor wonapost get up for s*** Iaposve shut the door on him.  A minute later she took a picture on her phone showing Arthur lying down in the hallway. The court was played living room footage showing Tustin walking into the kitchen before ing while looking at her phone and then walking into the hallway. She s carrying Arthur into the living room, Mr Hankin told the court. His body is limp. She carries Arthur into the kitchen then into the living room and places him on the floor. Arthur appears to be unconscious. His eyes are closed, body is limp. He falls to the left onto the floor. It appears his body is limp. Tustin gets up and goes into the kitchen. The next footage from .pm shows Tustin partially pick Arthur up from the floor and drag him into the hallway. She then reappears and places Arthur on the sofa before walking into the kitchen. Giving evidence in court earlier on Thursday, Tustinaposs hairdresser, Catherine Milhench, said she wished she had called police after seeing Arthur on June  and . Ms Milhench, who works from home and first cut Tustinaposs hair in the summer of , said she met Arthur later that year and he seemed absolutely fine, healthy, a normal boy.  Describing a hair appointment at her home in February , Ms Milhench said of Arthur: He was still, I would say, healthy-looking but not happy. He was made to sit downwith his hands on his knees and not move. Ms Milhench told the court: I just thought heaposs obviously been naughty at home. When you go to other peopleaposs you donapost want your child to misbehave. Answering questions from Mr Hankin, Ms Milhench said at another six-hour hair appointment on June  , Arthur was told by Tustin to stand by and face the front door. Mr Hankin asked Ms Milhench: Throughout the time that she was there in your home, how did she sheinteract with Arthur  The witness answered: Telling him to stand, not to lean on the door, to face the door... not to move. Tustin then went to the bathroom to have her hair washed, Ms Milhench said, adding of Arthur: He was made to come upstairs and face another door upstairs. She said he couldnapost be trusted. Asked for her view of Arthuraposs state during the visit, Ms Milhench said: Deteriorated. You could see his collar bones. He was wearing a pyjama onesie and you could just see his collar bones sticking out.  I didnapost remember that from last time. He had lost weight. Using the phrase like skeletal to describe what Arthuraposs condition made her think of, Ms Milhench said the boy appeared to be drained and weak, adding: It wasnapost nice to see. His legs trying to walk up the stairs would be shaking, like he couldnapost hold himself up. Asked what happened when Hughes arrived at her home to pick up Tustin, Ms Milhench added: He parked on my drive. Tom had himby the scruff, took him out. I remember Arthur falling on the floor. He just collapsed and fell into the car. The court heard Tustin ed to complete her hair appointment on June , arriving at around .am. During the visit, Ms Milhench said Tustin and Hughes were constantly swearing at Arthur like a game of tennis, with Tustin going on to claim that Arthur was being pressure-pointed. Ms Milhench said she had suggested Arthur should be sent to live with his grandmother, but was told that would be what he wants and would allow him to win. The court was also told that Ms Milhenchaposs partner, Tobias Jarman, snuck a drink of water to Arthur without Tustin and Hughes knowing. Mr Jarman, who said Arthur looked malnourished and had cracked lips, told the court: I tried to reassure him. I said, aposyou have not got to be scared of me in any wayapos. He look petried. It was not the normal glow you see in a kidaposs eyes of that age. It looked like there was fear ingrained inside of there. Hughes and Tustin deny murder. Tustin has admitted one count of child cruelty but has denied further charges of the same offence. Hughes also denies child cruelty offences.

Customers have been snapping the odd product choices in supermarkets like Tesco, Co-op and Asda across the country.It comes as Brits are warned of a light Christmas ahead after the UKaposs biggest container port reached capacity and was forced to turn ships away. Products are now being delayed and not making it into stores, according to reports. The shortages have been noticed by Brits up and down the country, who have been taking photographs of the rogue choices. One shared an image of fresh food crates at a Co-Op in Hertfordshire loaded with Quality Street, Celebrations and Dairy Milk instead of vegetables. Meanwhile, an Asda in Gloucester stretched out a display of Lynx deodorant to cover most of its toiletry aisle.  A Tesco Extra in Cardf was mocked after a massive sunflower oil display was spotted in the frozen food aisle. Staff at another Co-Op branch stuck rows of squeezey bottles of Heinz Salad Cream and HP sauce in refrigerators. The rogue items have been appearing in stores as shipping giant AP Moller-Maersk is erting vessels from their facility in Felixstowe, Suffolk. The Danish company warned the problem will continue into the new year. The issue has reportedly been caused by a lack of lorry drivers, a spike in imports and Covid restrictions at ports combining in a aposperfect stormapos.  Lars Mikael Jensen, head of the east-west network at Maersk, said containers are stacking up in Felixstowe because there are not enough drivers to aposget boxes outapos.Most imported toys come through the port, raising fears there will be shortages over Christmas, The Times reports. And today Tory Chancellor Rishi Sunak did little to reassure customers when discussing shortages - confessing that the government canapost fix every single problem.As fears grow of kids waking up on Christmas Day to empty stockings, the Chancellor said the Government were do absolutely everything we can to solve the British port issues.  Diverted ships are being unloaded at ports where, including Rotterdam, Antwerp and Bremerhaven, and are then transferred to smaller vessels to be transported to the UK. The process is reportedly causing delays of up to a week. Mr Jensen previously told : There is a shortage of truckers in the UK. Normally after four to five days the containers are out of the terminal and into a warehouse in Birmingham or wherever before coming back empty. “The trouble is that now we don’t have the same speed of flow of boxes moving in and out. With fewer truckers on average it takes longer to get boxes out of the terminal, so they are left standing. He also told The Times: We had to stop operations on a ship because there was nowhere to discharge the containers. Felixstowe is among the three worst affected ports in the world, Mr Jensen said. One shipping boss told The Times: I donapost want to sound like a Grinch but there are going to be gaps on shelves this Christmas. Mike Bowden, procurement manager at the shipping group Cory Brothers, added the port is so full of containers that new ones cannot be unloaded - and empty ones cannot be put back on ships. The Department of Transport told The Times that the issue was not aposunique to the UKapos, adding that ports around the world are battling container capacity and supply chain issues.

Madison Collins began suffering from head jerks and ticks, which mum Melanie says seemed to come from nowhere in January of this year.Melanie, , described how one frightening attack in June left -year-old Madison, known as Madi, unable to breathe and needing hospital treatment. The worried mum said she now fears the ticks are being caught via social media after learning  other girls developed similar symptoms.The manager said Madi is now aposticking every dayapos to the point where sheaposs repeated phrases  times, punched herself and her hands have even locked into place for three hours. Melanie remains sceptical that her daughteraposs sudden condition is caused by social media specically as she questions why boys have been less affected, however she said she aposwouldnapost rule it outapos. She is now speaking out about Madiaposs situation and urging parents with similar experiences to come forward to find its cause. Melanie, of Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, said: [The college] said that they had  girls and one boy that have ticks at the moment. I was relieved. I know thataposs an awful thing to say but hearing that made me know that something has actually happened.  Something is happening to make this happen to girls andI can find a reason for it, I can deal with it better. If somethingaposs happening as a nation, we need to get to the bottom of it. We owe it to our daughters to find out why this is happening and what we can do to make sure it doesnapost happen to other girls her age. I just felt like I wanted to do something and rather than sitting there speculating, I want to find out for myself how big of a problem this is rather than being told aposthis is happeningapos. I want to get people together so we can do something about it. I think thereaposs strength in numbers and rather than this getting pushed under the carpet,I can find other people going through this, we can push this to the government level to get something done about it and get proper research to find what the cause is. Research led by Dr Kirsten Muller-Vahl at the Hannover University Medical School stated that a spike in patients displaying aposticksapos positively correlated to a rise in videos featuring Touretteaposs on sites such as TikTok, YouTube and Instagram.The study claimed the rise in ticks could be viewed as a aposstress reactionapos to societyaposs emphasis on iniduality and aposvaluing their alleged exceptionalityapos, which they say promotes aposattention-seeking behavioursapos. Worried Melanie has read the articles on the subject and also heard the condition linked to stress from the pandemic but she remains unsure what is causing it. However she refuses to rule anything out and called for more people to come forward so that more research can be done.  Melanie said: Online articles are saying that social media sites like TikTok is a probable cause. One of them is that people are going on there to highlight their ticks and thataposs starting off other kids to have it. On my LinkedIn posts there have been comments that have been said about that social media is being looked into as a possible cause, people have said aposmaybe social media is the reason whyapos, thereaposs been a couple of articles as well that have been linked on my LinkedIn post. My gut is telling me that itaposs external. Something has happened which is affecting girls. A lot of people are putting it down to [social media] or the stress of the pandemic but Iaposm not convinced of that because Madi will delete her social media every so often. Andshe feels like sheaposs becoming a bit consumed by social media she will delete it from time to time and will almost hit a reset and then go back to it. When I asked her about her stress levels during the pandemic she wasnapost particularly overly stressed. Iaposm not saying that it hasnapost played a part in it, Iaposm just not convinced she was stressed enough to bring on ticks. But then I donapost know, Iaposm not a medical doctor. I donapost think itaposs social media because I thinkit was social media,it was TikTok, like people are saying, I think boys would be affected. I wouldnapost rule it out. But I just thinkit was social media, it would affect boys as well, particularly as this condition is more prevalent in boys than it is in girls.  Melanie, who described her daughter as aposreliableapos, aposactiveapos and aposfunnyapos said she never had any of these symptoms as a child and from her understanding most children with Touretteaposs usually get recognised by the child is six-years-old. The devoted mum said sheaposs also been told by professionals that normally cases of Touretteaposs are more prevalent in boys. However, in the last  months thereaposs been a massive spike in referrals for girls between the ages of -. Melanie said: It was probably about eight months ago that she started these head ticks where she was jolting her head and they started getting progressively worse. Then she started having almost seizure-type ticks where her eyes would roll in the back of her head. We had to phone the ambulance, sheaposs been to hospital about it twice. They were so bad that she couldnapost breathe properly. It was almost like a seizure but when she was in hospital they confirmed it wasnapost because her vitals were quite normal, so it was just a tick spasm attack. It was frightening to watch. Sheaposs had a few of those. And then the vocal ticks about this time started kicking in as well. Madi says the ticks have had a dramatic effect on her daily le.  Her ticks include clicking noises, neck jerks, punching herself, vocal ticks in which she repeats a phrase repeatedly, sometimes for a whole day, scratching herself and even banging her head against the table. Madi said: When the ticks were small it didnapost really matter and to be honest I put it down to anxiety ticks for quite a long time and I just thought theyaposd go away. And when they got really bad it stopped everything. I used to read a lot and for a few weeks after my ticks got really bad I just couldnapost pick up a book, Iaposd just throw it. And there are still times I do throw my books. Just not as often now, you kind of learn how to deal with it. I wasnapost able to sit through my classes. I was told to leave a lot. I practically wasnapost able to do anything normal anymore. Everything became a lot harder. When I was working at the restaurant, I would have incidents where I would throw a glass on the floor. Then when I was trying to pick it up, I would just put it in my mouth and try to bite down unless someone took it out. There will be days where I can barely walk a few steps without falling over. When Iaposm trying to have a conversation with someone, my vocal ticks can get in the way and they can cause a lot of mishaps. For example, people think Iaposm calling them a b*tch or something. When Iaposm trying to do assessments or exams it can be really hard. I was trying to do an assessment in criminology and my hands locked so I was trying to do it with one hand and it didnapost unlock for three hours after, which is quite painful because itaposs quite a cramping one. Mum-of-three Melanie shared a post on LinkedIn and said that around - parents have contacted her, with around four or five of them saying their children have suddenly developed Touretteaposs.  She said that Madiaposs college have been aposabsolutely brilliantapos and theyaposve kept her included in all the decisions made surrounding her education. Melanie said: She hasnapost been diagnosed with Touretteaposs yet because she had to have symptoms for over a year to get diagnosed. Itaposs walking that fine line of not accepting it but at the same time accepting it because you donapost want her to feel uncomfortable by it. At the moment it looks like Touretteaposs, thataposs what itaposs presenting itself as. It was a lot to get my head around and to be honest itaposs only then when talking to the college that I was realising that other girls are going through this that I thought there must be a cause, andwe can find the reason weaposve got a better chance of finding treatment or a cure. Dr Muller-Vahl et alaposs study claimed teenagers were presenting ticks similar to a popular German YouTuber who demonstrated them in his videos, which have gone viral over the last two years. Suzanne Dobson of Touretteaposs Action, a UK-based charity that researches the condition and supports affected families, suggested in an interview earlier this year that social media may simply be encouraging teenage girls to be more open about their ticks. But she also speculated that gathering more aposlikesapos for demonstrating severe ticks, could be resulting in the girls no longer trying to stop the ticks. Hospitals in the UK claim to have seen an increase in ticks being reported in teenage girls since the pandemic. Great Ormond Street and Evelina Childrenaposs Hospitals each received between four and six referrals of ticks in teenage girls between -. However during the last three months of , this surged to each receiving three to four referrals per week.

There will be lots of warmth for Wales, southern and eastern England and some parts of Scotland over the weekend. But it will be very chilly in the evenings with some paces seeing set for a - freeze - and there is rain coming our way from Monday.The Met Office say temperatures remain way above average for this time of year after an incredible October.

Meteorologist Aidan McGivern says the sun will continue to shine for the weekend. Weaposre looking at widely C or C across England, Wales and eastern Scotland, and in some spots thereaposs the possibility of C, he said.Temperatures way above average for this time of year, and that mild theme continues into the start of next week, but increasingly weaposll get an Atlantic influence and that means greater chance of wet and windy weather from Monday onwards.Next week looks wet, windy and very mild across the UK, particularly in the west.  This weekend by contrast will start off cold, and then many places will enjoy a dry and bright weekend, with the brightest skies across the east and the south east. Cloud and rain will affect north-western areas, particularly western Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Met Office man added: In the countryside, knock off a few degrees and weaposre looking at widespread frost in the east and the north.  There could also be some dense fog patches first thing Saturday, slowly lting through the morning. It will be milder towards the west, C or C towards the southwest, and colder to the north east, C or C. The first snowfall of the season could hit as early as next week. Some forecasts suggest snow could fall over high ground late next week, possibly the October - weekend. Friday night Many parts cold and clear with grass frost for central, northern and eastern UK. Windy with showers far northeast Scotland. Patchy low cloud and drizzle far southwest ing northeast later. Saturday Fog patches in south-west clearing by midday.

Jaclyn Misch, from Michigan, USA, was -years-old when she started to think she had a health issue as she hadnapost had her period yet. After several doctors appointments she was diagnosed with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-HauserType , a rare condition that occurs in females and mainly affects the reproductive system. Essentially it means that she was born with no womb or cervix, and also has an incomplete vagina. A dilator was used to stretch her vaginal canal so that she could have penetrative sex, but she cannot carry her own child. In , the now -year-old who won the title of Miss Michigan USA , met Jonathan and then married him in .  The couple tried for a baby through IVF and gestational surrogacy, but after three failed embryo transfers they parted ways from their former carrier. They currently have a new gestational carrier that volunteered to potentially carry their baby. I was diagnosed with MRKH when I was sixteen my family physician was concerned I had never started my cycle but since I was lean and athletic, thought this might be the delay, Jaclyn said.  At sixteen years old, I really wanted to pretend that none of this was happening, so thataposs exactly what I did. Iaposd been trying so hard to fit in with my high school friends, but as fate would have it, my diagnosis had a dferent path planned for me. I was now one in , women around the world diagnosed with MRKH Syndrome. The fundamental biological traits that made me a woman, my self-identity and the plans for my future had shted.  I had to use dilators to have sex, I would never have a period and be like my girlfriends and I would never carry a child. I didnapost feel the same as other females and I frankly still donapost. Jaclyn said she kept quiet about the condition for years, not even telling members of her own family. Husband Jonathan helped the wine educator and marketer open up. He encouraged me to enter my first pageant and I won, she continued. I truly feel like I won as a way to use the  to spread awareness about MRKH syndrome. At the time of my diagnosis, there was no social media and the only thing my parents and I could find online about it were a few research articles. I felt confused, scared and angry. I ignored most of my emotion towards it and didnapost want to think about it.  It took me years to come to terms with the diagnoses and fully process. I had to learn to become comfortable in my own skin again for sixteen years of my le I had been conditioned by society and our culture to think I would grow up, get married and have a baby. Jaclyn had long hoped that she would one day become a mum.  I played with baby dolls and dreamt of having a baby bump, she continued. So when the diagnosis came, my self-identity shted and I had to start envisioning a le without the blessing of pregnancy. As far as sexual intercourse goes, I think itaposs important to preface this by saying everything is aposnormalapos down there on the outside. But girls with MRKH have a aposshallowapos vaginal canal, meaning in order to have sexual intercourse you need to self-dilate . Or have surgery to elongate the vaginal canal my doctor and I decided dilation was my best option, as itaposs also the first line of treatment recommended by The American College of Gynaecology.  I didnapost have much of an issue and things went quickly and smoothly. As happy as the couple are together, MRKH has had an affect on their relationship. Iaposve been with my husband Jonathan since  and I have to say that my diagnosis affects our relationship emotionally in our journey to parenthood, Jaclyn said. Seeing our friends get pregnant so fast and easily will always strike a small chord in my mind. Of course, Iaposm happy for them but always wishing to have that ability myself. After our three failed embryo transfers and parting ways with our previous gestational carrier I was a mess. Asking myself what my le purpose is, will we ever have a child of our own  I was completely deflated, and it hit me much harder than Jonathan. Instead of the path to parenthood being joyful and happy ours is stressful, emotional, and draining both mentally and financially. Our journey to parenthood is by far the most challenging. For the longest time, Iaposve seen PGS aposchromosomally normalapos embryos taking on the first time. Iaposve had friends with MRKHget pregnant on their first transfer with their high-quality embryos so naturally, I thought we would too as our embryos were perfectly normal. But that wasnapost the case three times in a row. The waiting period is also extremely dficult. Between transfers, waiting for the two-week pregnancy blood test building up excitement only to be completely deflated with the negative results. Currently, we have a new gestational carrier and are beyond grateful that she and her husband have volunteered to help us start a family. We are in the process of having her screened by our IVF doctor. Jaclyn hopes that others will gain strength from her story. She said: You are never alone so many women have been diagnosed with MRKH from around the world there is an entire network of MRKH sisters waiting for you with encouragement, understanding and support through every phase of MRKH.

Next, dose up on vitamin C by including oranges or kiwi in your breakfast, or by simply throwing fresh berries in with your porridge. The bad news for hot drink fans is tea and coffee should be the last drink you reach for, with nutritionist Amanda Ursell explaining the caffeine content of the drinks may dehydrate you further, so stick the the orange juice instead. Nutritional therapist Julie Silver recommends also using a saltpipe - an inhaler designed to help improve our respiratory systems - to alleviate coughing and sneezing. They can be picked up online for around £.  Afternoon GP Dr Sarah Brewer recommended staying inside and keeping warmyou feeling a cold coming on. If the nose gets too cold, these immune systems don’t work properly, so you are more susceptible to infection, she explained. Staying indoors also limits the spread of infection.

So stock up.He also advised to stay well hydrated by drinking plenty of water to beat that scratchy feeling that develops at the back of our throats when the temperatures drop. Alcohol can dehydrate you further so itaposs best to stay off the booze for a bit. Nutritionist Amanda recommended snacking on nuts, as they contain selenium which supports our immune systems.  Evening Saving the best until last, having a cold is the perfect excuse to get a curry in.

The issue is - she had bought it for her nephew, who is refusing to share the cash and has now blocked her. Taking to Reddit, the woman askedshe was in the wrong over her demands following the unexpected win. In a devastating account, the woman explains she has lost her job and is struggling to cover her bills, so the cash could change her le.  And while sheaposs not sometimes not sure where her next meal is coming from, her nephew is from a wealthy family and has a college fund. Now the devastated woman has taken to Redditaposs aposAm I The A****** forumapos to askshe is in the wrong. I have had a really rough year, laid off from my job and Iaposm out of unemployment options, she wrote. I do own my house and managed to scrape buy to pay my property taxes and insurance with odd jobs but I am eating ramen just about every meal. I love my nephew and canapost get by on the thought that I wouldnapost be able to get him a birthday present . I scraped together whatever change I could and bought him some lottery scratchers. and holy s*** he actually won . One was for about  which was cool enough but the second one was actually into the middle  figures. I mean le-changing money . His parentsare very well off.  My nephew has a fully funded college fund and every material thing he could ever want.When I found out I told my sister that it would be really coolmy nephew gave me at least   of the winnings. She askedI was serious. I said I felt I was being very generous because I really need all of it. She actually hung up on me. I texted my nephew and I think he actually blocked me. Hereaposs the thing, I NEED this money. Itaposs a matter of me eating or not eating. He doesnapost. Am I the a****** for thinking he should share the winnings of the gt I gave him  Lots of people said the woman didnapost deserve any of the cash. One person blasted: You donapost get to ask for part of someoneaposs gt. It sucks youaposre having it tough but still doesnapost mean youaposre generous for asking for only part of the gt. Sure ask them for help, but donapost ask for his gt. Another sarcastically added: Hereaposs a gt itaposs probably worthless butby some miracle it turns out to be worth something I want it back. Itaposs only for youitaposs actually worthless. Great gt, OP. And not how gts work, you only get to add that kind of conditions in advance. YTA. A third took a more sympathetic approach, replying: I completely understand where youaposre coming from, youaposre frustrated that you pulled together this money and someone much more well off managed to win a load of money on the cards you bought. I would apologize to them, though. Explain it was s***** for you to insist you deserve it for buying the cards because they were a gt. But I would also explain you werenapost trying to be selfish and went about it wrong, that it would mean a lothe would share some of the winnings because youaposre really struggling right now and it would change a lot of your le for the better.

Garry responded, saying: Firstly Kyle, go back to school and learn how to spell yo drop out T*AT.

I donapost go swearing at old women and stuff or swearing in front of kids. I think comments like that one are rude and insulting - even when they donapost realise. I think a one-star review is insultingitaposs not justied. Iaposm sticking up for myself.

If I had time to do it Iaposd have done it. I was too busy and there was a queue of people behind so heaposll have known I was busy. It might seem a simple thing but sometimes youaposre too busy to do anything  than the simple menu. I reacted like that because thereaposs no need for that one-star review. I donapost have an anger problem. Iaposm a very laid back, calm person. It just gets under my skin. I think a lot of people understand that and people have come to my shop because theyaposve seen my response to a review. I donapost just do it for no reason. If anybody has an actual genuine complaint about something Iaposm willing to listen to them, but thataposs very, very rare.

I’ve grown since then, I’ve grown as a person and I feel like now I can tell the story and not actually cringe as bad about it, she explained in a TikTok video. I’m not sure how old I was, I think I was about  and I was dating my bosses’ brother at the time and I was proper in love with him, I don’t know why. But I was head over heels, didnapost go near a single other boy and he was the one - at the time. During the relationship, Lauren was on the contraceptive pill and said sheaposd always been really good at taking it. However, when she went to collect her pills, a nurse asked her whether she wanted to take a routine chlamydia test, to which she replied: I donapost need to because I donapost have it. She was like, aposit’s fine, it’s just a swap, it will come back negativeyou’re so sure.apos I was like aposI don’t need toapos, Lauren added, explaining how she repeatedly told the nurse she didnapost need to, as sheaposs only been with her boyfriend and they both took a test before getting together. This woman wouldn’t let it drop, I mean I’m glad. She kept saying aposit’s only a swabapos, so I just did it. I went to the toilets, did the chlamydia test, gave her back the pee and the swab and was done with it.

Lauren had completely forgotten she had even done the test, when the clinic got back in touch with her two weeks later and told her she needed to give them a call as they had her test results. She continued: I always used to get a text saying it was negative, so I was like aposwhy am I getting phone calls apos I rang them and she was like ‘Yeah your test has come back positive, I’m just letting you know.apos I s*** myself. First person I told was my grandma - she was like aposit’s fine, you’ve caught it,apos because obviously it’s very seriousyou don’t catch chlamydia, it can stop you having children. So, I was crying my eyes out because I’ve always wanted kids.  Lauren decided to go to the clinic and take the medication to get rid of the infection before confronting her ex, who went on to deny having given her the STI. He’d been cheating - I think he said he’d slept with three other girls behind my back - that was the start of me being cheated on - all the time, she said. Anyway, it was really easy to treat and I’m just so glad I caught it. I can never thank that woman enough who just absolutely blagged my head and teenage me was like aposshut up.apos I’m so glad she made me get a test. Lauren then issued a stark warning to others on the app, telling them: Evenyou think it’s amazing with your boyfriend , go and get a test, or use a condom. Seriously.

Gil Wizen was staying at a reserve in Napo province of eastern Ecuador, when he followed a trail of baby spiders in his bedroom to find a Brazilian wandering spider and its offspring.The spider, which is as big as a human hand, had taken refuge under Mr Wilzen’s bed where she was seemingly guarding her children, the Daily Star reported.Mr Wizen managed to take a photograph to document his face to face encounter with the venomous creature, capturing an image which has now won him a prestigious award. The spider room, which is the name given to the image, saw Mr Wilzen awarded the Wildle Photographer of the Year award for Urban Wildle. According to notes on the award website, Mr Wilzen used forced perspective to make it appear even larger. Following the success in capturing the moment, a daring Mr Wilzen safely relocated the spider outside. Speaking on his blog about the photograph, in a post which appears to be from , he said: Not only there were literally thousands of spiderlings under the bed, right beside them rested one of the biggest aposnon-tarantulaapos spiders I have ever seen. “Its bodywas mm but with its leg span it could easily cover my hand.  Brazilian wandering spiders are more commonly known to roam forest floors at night rather than bedrooms. They search for prey such as frogs and cockroaches. Although their toxic venom can be deadly to mammals including humans, it can also be used for medicinal uses. The overall winner for this year’s Wildle Photographer of the Year went to French biologist and underwater photographer Laurent Ballesta. She managed to capture a camouflage grouper fish swimming around in a cloud of eggs and sperm. Other winning photos included fighting fish, an inquisitive underwater elephant, a calm gorilla and a beautul reflection in a coral reef.

Matt Streatfeild, from Newcastle, New South Wales, in Australia, came across the message from the past as he knocked down two walls in his home as part of a renovation. Intrigued he opened the letter dated April , , and to his surprise found it was written from the plasterers who built the walls. It was meant to give future generations an idea of what le was like back in the mid-s. You always hear the legend of messages in a bottle, but you never think youaposll find one in between two walls in your own house, Mr Streatfeild said. The letter said the workers from Newcastle Interior Linings, which still exists today, earned each week and that the bottle was one of the first measured in metric being equal to a “one imperial pint”.  The workers were also listed and Mr Streatfeild was able to track down Ron Niddrie, one of the plasterers who is now aged . One of these little mementos has paid off, Mr Niddrie told NBN News.. The fact that it was  years ago was even more of a shock. The message stated: “We are waiting for our weekly wages which are, gross, . .  “The bottle is one of the early metric, as we are beginning a metric conversion, it is equal to one imp pint.” Mr Streatfeild now says that he will now put the bottle back behind the new wall when it is built and add a bottle of his own for future generations.

Lukas Ostertag was one of the underwater group who encountered the freaky sea beast while ing in the Sataya Reef, off the Egyptian coast. The -year-old described the creature’s appearance as being a “long square rubber pipe-like thing” with a pointy end. “It looked like nothing Iaposve seen before,” he said. It definitely was super strange as it seemed to move on its own and nobody knew what it was. Lukas said it reminded him of the Yrr - a fictional deep-sea species hellbent on destroying mankind, dreamed up by Frank Sch tzing for his novel, The Swarm.  He and his fellow ers thought it might be a kind of polyp - a soft-bodied organism related to sea anemones and jellyfish. Others guessed it to be a worm or a kind of plant, Lukas said, while one other person thought it might be a jellyfish. Looking for answers, Lukas, from Heidelberg, Germany, shared his photos with an online group dedicated to identying marine animals. However, the members seemed to share his confusion. One person wrote: Wow this thing is a puzzler. I could see it being a siphonophore, soft coral, pyrosome, maybe nemertean, or jellyfish arm. Iaposm stumped.  Another commented: Looks like a nemertean - ribbon worm, but the jellyfish part is possible as well. In the end, Lukas got an answer when footage emerged from another group that had been ing the same reef. In the end we figured out it was from a jellyfish as another e group the same day made a video,” he said. The thing we saw was the leftover arms of the jellyfish, probably after being devoured by a sea turtle. I guess in the end the arms were still moving a bit because the jellyfish was not eaten long ago.  The specic species is thought to be the Thysanostoma lorerum. Lukas said it had been “fun” figuring out what the creature was after being “so clueless” upon the initial sighting. “That we found out it was a jellyfish was pure luck,” he said.

When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

A History of Violence [later turned into a film by David Cronenberg] sees the writer depart from the sprawl of post-apocalyptic Mega-Cities to modern-day small-town America. The initial premise is a simple one, but brilliant in its execution. A reluctant hero gets his picture in the paper and is recognised by some very bad people from his past.

Another simple concept, but it comes alive in the hands of writer Peter Milligan. Chock-a-block with broken, warped and wonderfully evocative characters inside and out, and aided and abetted by deliriously trippy, twisted visuals by original artist, the late Brett Ewins.

But thatrsquos no criticism, anything but. Normally we have a superhero team portrayed as dysal characters, who see their powers as much a curse as a blessing, with a pressing need to get together to take on a greater threat.In the O men, we have superheroes whose powers, in the face of the everyday issues, are incidental. The type of issues we all face in terms of relationships, making ends meet, looking forward to the weekend.Think of your favourite soap-cum-kitchen sink drama with a sprinkling of superhero powers. It shouldnrsquot work, but it does.

A Transporter Chief no less. Hersquos always there, ready to transport the major characters onto the surface of some alien planet or other, but never really appreciated by his peers . From such unpromising beginnings is born a cult comedy classic. Jon Adams describes it thus: ldquoFor fans of crappy jobs, space travel, and ennui. And I guess,itrsquos on this list, I must be a fan as well!The book consists of single-page comic strips with the main character always upbeat and happy to help despite the constant putdowns. OrsquoBrien remains statuesque in many of his scenes. Unmoving, someone you wouldnrsquot notice twice. The result is, by turn, unexpectantly charming, sad, and very, very funny. Chief OrsquoBrien at Work has to be read to be believed.chiefobrienatworkGood Cop by Jim Alexander is out on paperback and on Kindle and available from Amazon, Barnes and Noble and Kobo."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13106129.jpg?type=article-full","title":"jo-malone-london-launches-christmas-collection","story":"Jo Malones Pomegranate Noir iscertain to leave youfeeling festive longbefore Halloween has landed.

I thought it might be fitting for the bell to be recommissioned and used again in remembrance of the  lives lost.”Towards the end of , Bill contacted a local craftsman and friend, Richard Wilson, and askedhe could help. It had been hoped to have the clapper made and fitted ready for the anniversary in , however plans had to be delayed due to the pandemic.In the meantime, Richard carried out online research and was eventually able to get inside the Cathedral to measure up, acquiring the bronze for the clapper proved dficult locally so he had to source it online.“It took me around a fortnight to make the clapper in my shed at home mostly using a hobby lathe and a CNC router,# said Richard.#I was a bit taken aback when Bill asked me to do this for him. Obviously, it is a great honour and a privilege for me to be asked considering the history of the ship and the lives lost during the sinking.#Hopefully this clapper will be around for years to come and will be used to commemorate the event each year.”However, this was only half the tale. The clapper needed a tassel — a rope that someone would actually hold to ring the bell.Fran Hollinrake is the visitor services officer and custodian at the cathedral.She said that, having attended several commemorations over the years, her and her husband Andy became friendly with a couple, John and Tracy Welch.John’s father, Stoker Petty Officer John Welch, was on board HMS Royal Oak the night she sank, but he survived.His son, John, was a rigger in the Tyneside dockyards, and spent much of his working le working with ropes, but ill-health prevented John from making the tassel.Instead he passed the job on to his former apprentice and friend Paul New.John and his we Tracy arrived in Orkney this week and were present at the unveiling.John said of his father#s experience on that fateful night: #The night of the sinking he was on deck having a cigarette when the explosion happened. He managed to get off the ship and into the water and was picked up by the Daisy II.#He said he had held on to another chap in the water who was in dficulty,  as he was an excellent swimmer and had medals for le saving and water polo, but when they were both pulled aboard by the crew of the Daisy unfortunately the other chap had died. He was lucky to escape with burns to his hands and face.#After medical attention I think a week or so later he was sent back to Portsmouth to join another ship.“As I far as I can remember he never ed to Orkney, but after the war attended the reunions in Portsmouth on a regular basis. As for his feelings about that night it wasn’t something he went into in great detail, but he did say thathe could get back on the ship he would know exactly where his gold lighter and cigarette case were.#Representing the council, who maintain the Cathedral on behalf of the people of Orkney, Councillor Stephen Clackson also has a personal connection to the Royal Oak, having tragically lost his uncle Ronald George Clackson when the ship went down.He said: “My Uncle Ronny was the closest sibling in age to my dad and his favourite brother. He was very technically minded and joined the Royal Navy on July , , aged ¾, for ‘  ’ years.#After training at the shore establishment HMS Victory, he was posted to the recommissioned HMS Royal Oak as an ordinary seaman on June , , when the ship was expected to be embarking on a -month tour of the Mediterranean.#Looming hostilities set the course of the battleship in another direction, and by August she was in Scapa Flow. My uncle was reported missing presumed killed when the Royal Oak was sunk by torpedoes from the U- in the early hours of October , just a week after his th birthday.#The news was devastating for my grandmother, whose brother had been killed on the Somme in World War I at the same age, and she never really got over it. I often wonder about my uncle’s short spell in Orkney and how he celebrated his last birthday on October , .”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

My thoughts are with his family and loved ones.Speaking before Sir Davidrsquos death was confirmed, Conservative MP and former party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith told the BBC News channel: ldquoThe reality for us is that we see constituents all the time, both in their houses and in surgeries.ldquoWersquore out and about, wersquore always available, we must be available, itrsquos the most critical bit of what makes the British parliamentary system I think one of the most accessible in the world, and thatrsquos because we want it that way.ldquoWe donrsquot want to be cowed or frightened into doing something dferent, and I certainly wonrsquot, and I know my colleagues will feel the same.ldquoSo I hope this is resolved very, very quickly, as I say, but we will certainly want to continue the way that we do things.ldquoOf course there may be some other elements that may be added to it, but notwithstanding that I want my constituents to have full access and Irsquom sure David would have felt the same.Also speaking before Sir Davidrsquos death was confirmed, Judith Canham, deputy chair of the local Conservative club, said Sir David was a ldquotrue constituency MP and a ldquofriend to everyone.ldquoI just canrsquot believe it, how anybody could harm a kind man like David I donrsquot know, she told Sky News.ldquoIrsquom terribly in shock. I burst into tears as soon as I heard because we do love him dearly.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting. Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4156275.jpg--.jpg?1634197280000\n","title":"march for jake raises 5 651","story":"THE ‘Long March’ from Belfast to Ballymena which bandsmen took part in to raise funds for local youngster Jake Oliver drummed up fantastic support.

Jake was prescribed anti-biotics and his mum was advised to use a humidier and also a steamy bathroom. There was no improvement in Jake’s condition and the family spent  weeks going back and forth trying to find out just why their little boy was so ill. Eventually a visit to AE and blood tests led to Jake being referred to the RVH Children’s Hospital where they received the devastating diagnosis.“It has been a really dficult time for Jake,” said Karen “as he missed all of his P year, with the exception of a few days. “We are all very grateful for the fantastic suppport we’ve received from these bandsmen.”Among the marchers in September was local councillor, Rodney Quigley who said that the joint effort by the band members was to be praised.“I couldn’t make the entire walk because of prior engagements but I was proud to be there at the .am start in East Belfast with my local band colleagues. “Jake has relations in the ranks of Gertude Star Flute Band and it was their idea to do the walk to Ballymena.“I know their fund raising page has received a lot of donations from local bands and its great to see such unity on the marching band front,” he said. One of the walk’s organisers, Gertrude Star’s Andrew Larmour said the walk to Ballymena was one of the proudest days of his le.“Walking with my Gertrude brothers and making three new friends for le in GeorgeBarr , Lyle Murray and Rodney Quigley was an honour.“It is great to know that we have helped Jake and his mum Karen Oliver through this event.” Karen and Jake were there to welcome the intrepid walkers to Ballymena and she said she was overwhelmed by the generosity shown.She said: “Tonight Jake,Emelia and I met up with everyone walking at Queen Street and finished the walk with them! “We cannot thank you all enough! Jake was a little out of sorts due to increasing his Saturday chemotherapy dosage but he just stayed in my arms and took it all in this evening.“ I wish I could thank absolutely every one in person for joining the walk and giving donations you have all blown us away by your generosity.”Last week. Andrew posted: “Went down to Ballymena to hand over what was raised on our sponsored walk a few weeks ago.  “Can now say after counting final total tonight cheque and cash pound was raised in aid of wee Jake Oliver. “Again Id like thank everyone that donated to the sponsored walk also the ones that took part on the walk and Gertrude Star , Pride of the Maine and Ballykeel LSOU bands. “Your generosity didnt go unnoticed thank you.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4157474.jpg--.jpg?1634222796000\n","title":"nipsa wants stormont department to take over management of council","story":"NIPSA has confirmed that it has written to the Minister for Communities asking that the Department takes over the managementat Mid and East Antrim Borough Council.

Together with its plans for Christmas  and beyond, the events provided delegates with an opportunity to meet Mary Waide who was elected Regional President for the North Region at the beginning of the pandemic.Following opening prayers and a welcome by Mary Waide, regional board members of SVP took to the stage to present ious aspects of the Society’s work to assembled guests representing their local SVP Conferences.Following a thought provoking spiritual reflection, board members presented the Society’s retail strategy for its  Vincent’s shops in Northern Ireland, a report of the outreach into prisons, details of how each Conference should report on its finances and new ways of adhering to policies and procedures for those being assisted by the charity and those providing the assistance.An interactive element encouraged guests to engage in a healthy discussion with board members before closing prayers. Mary Waide, Regional President of SVP North Region, said: “I am absolutely delighted with the success of this series of SVP Member Roadshows and the feedback from those who were able to attend.It was important for the SVP regional board to get out into our local communities having had such a long time apart from our members face to face. The focus of the roadshows were to primarily express our gratitude to our members for the sterling work they have been continuing to do on the ground to help those who have needed it most, during the most trying of times, and to share with them our SVP vision for the longer term. “The dedication of members of SVP has never been more important than it has been in the past  months. I know from experience how daunting it has been trying to help the vulnerable in our community without compromising or risking the health of those who are supporting those in need. As we move forward, it is my hope that our Conferences in County Antrim continue to go from strength to strength under the guidance of Frederic Ozanam who founded SVP almost  years ago.”SVP is an international charity and the largest voluntary charity in Ireland. SVP members in Northern Ireland work in all communities to support people whatever their background, who are experiencing poverty and social exclusion, promoting self-sufficiency and working for social justice. Every year SVP spends approximately pound million to help those experiencing poverty in Northern Ireland. Last year, SVP responded to tens of thousands of calls for assistance from members of the public.

Credit: Jmac.PhotosGillian HallidayTwitterEmailOctober   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Ireland’s oldest postman has retired after nearly  years serving his community, marking the milestone by celebrating his th birthday.Liam O’Keefe, who lives in Convoy, Co Donegal, started delivering the post in Omagh, Co Tyrone when he joined Royal Mail at the age of .He previously worked in jobs for a number of firms before applying to join the postal service.After a few years on the door-to-door beat, he took up a role working at the Omagh sorting office, where he marked his last day in the job on Wednesday.“I guess I was the oldest and now I’m retired,” Liam told the Belfast .“I did love the job. It was quite the experience. I put a lot into it and there was highs and lows, but mostly highs.”Liam said he took the role of handling the public’s mail seriously, explaining: “Just generally, you have to have a certain amount of security about it and respect for other people. You have to ensure that things keep moving along. Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “I’d been based in the office for about  years, sorting mail for delivery, doing the wages and things like that.”He has witnessed the job transform over the years from hands-on to the advent of machines to sort the mail, speeding up the process.The Donegal man said his last day in his job, which was first reported by the Ulster Herald, was “just another day in the office”, but his colleagues helped ensure it was memorable.“I didn’t do anything dferent, really. I didn’t want a fuss, but there was sandwiches, cakes and buns,” he added.Delivering the post is something of a family trade for Liam, with his sons Paul and Richard based in the Omagh office and his grandson Kyle having been a postman for five years.“Richard mainly worked with me and Kyle gets his mail from the Omagh office in the morning and goes to Dromore to deliver it,” he said.One demand of the role Liam is more than happy to say goodbye to is the eye-watering early starts.“The last while, especially since Covid, I’ve been getting up for work at am and getting into work for am, driving from Donegal, then my sht would end at .pm,” he said. “The way we worked was a three-day week, doing double shts.”Now that he has extra free time on his hands, Liam is planning to get more involved with his local Gaelic football team.“I do a bit of training and I’m involved with the senior team a bit as well” he said. “I’ve a big interest in the county team as well. I’ve plenty to keep me going.”With more than four decades of memories to look back on at the Omagh office, Liam has plenty of memories, good and bad.Among the worst is Omagh’s darkest moment: the day the Real IRA blew up the town centre. The atrocity, on August , , killed  people, including a woman pregnant with twins, nine children and three generations of one family.It was the single biggest tragedy of the Troubles, and took place three months after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.“I was working that Saturday. It never leaves you. [In] the aftermath... the photographers, the post office was overrun with Press doing stories. They used the roof of the post office because it was the highest point in the town for photographs.”He also recalled the official visit to Omagh by then United States president Bill Clinton and his we Hillary, who mourned with the victims of the attack a month later.“It was a big thing when he came, all the security that surrounded him,” Liam told the Belfast “Loads of things happened over the years. All sorts of things happened during the Troubles, but the last  years, it has settled down and been good. “During those early years it was rough, though.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadFirefighter who flew to work in Hampshire from NI wins case for unfair dismissalWhatsApp scam involving ‘fake family members’ sweeps Northern IrelandMurdered mum Katrina Rainey saw daughter die in accidentPSNI detective got £k overtime on top of salary as force’s bill hits £k a dayUUP’s Lord Empey demands answers from Ian Paisley over claim PM promised to ‘tear up’ NI ProtocolTop VideosPlayVideo: Garfield Beattie found guilty of sending threat signed by UVF \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Murder investigation launched after woman dies in Knockcloughrim car firePlayVideo: Firefighters battle Belfast flat fireLatest Northern IrelandMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageLegal case against DUP ‘boycott’ of north-south meetings toto courtAgriculture Minister Poots hails Brexit as farmers to get £m paymentDUP accused of showing ‘disdain for rule of law’ with north-south talks no-showsCovid infection levels rise in England, driven by rates among childrenLatestUlster vs Emirates Lions LIVE: Province aim to continue unbeaten start to URC seasonMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageBrendan Rodgers happy and thinking long-term with LeicesterTory MP Sir David Amess dead after being stabbed at constituency meetingMan admits raping and murdering pensioner,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

All of it has added up to this. “Anyone that handed my family and friends their change while in the bar and asked for it to be donated, up in Broslashn,you dropped a few quid into their mason jar after a meal,you took part in the Sandwich Co’s breakfast fundraiser oryou bought one of the Iron Man cocktails down at the Taphouse! and of course all of the people that liked, shared and donated on FB, Instagram or Twitter.     “All of you have helped out and all of you played your part in raising this money, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. “A special thank you to Joe Mc Kane and Odhran Mc Kane and the McKane family for being with me every step of the way.

They will receive a National Trust voucher to the value of pound. Aine and John began growing their own food this year after signing up to the National Lottery funded Acorn FarmI can growproject which involves  local families being mentored by a horticulturalist in growing their own fruit and vegetables over an-monthperiod. googletag.cmd.push Participants have received raised beds, seedlings and guidance on how to nurture their plants. Primary one teacher, Aine Kivlehan, said: Weve never won anything before, so this is a lovely surprise. Its incredibly satisfying eating a meal with ingredients grown in your garden. My son John really enjoys it too and we both find its a great way to relax. Im hoping to set up a little gardening club for some local children in the coming months to pass on some of the lessons weve learned as part of the wonderful Acorn Farm I can grow project. We are just so delighted to be part of this and to be given the opportunity to do something so positive for our environment. Having done a little bit of growing in the past, Aine was excited to see the Acorn FarmI can growprojects call out for interest to people in the Derry City and Strabane District area and signed up to be part of it. John really loves checking on the veg and watering the plants and Ive enjoyed getting some tips from the horticulturalist which Ive passed onto friends. Its lovely being able to lt something from your back garden and bring it into the kitchen to cook for dinner. It has been catching too with neighbours popping over to have a look and being inspired to give growing a go themselves.     Mayor Warke congratulated the pair, saying, It fills me with pride to see a local family like the Kivlehans doing their bit for the environment and turning their hand to growing their own food.

They will receive a National Trust voucher to the value of pound. Aine and John began growing their own food this year after signing up to the National Lottery funded Acorn FarmI can growproject which involves  local families being mentored by a horticulturalist in growing their own fruit and vegetables over an-monthperiod. googletag.cmd.push Participants have received raised beds, seedlings and guidance on how to nurture their plants. Primary one teacher, Aine Kivlehan, said: Weve never won anything before, so this is a lovely surprise. Its incredibly satisfying eating a meal with ingredients grown in your garden. My son John really enjoys it too and we both find its a great way to relax. Im hoping to set up a little gardening club for some local children in the coming months to pass on some of the lessons weve learned as part of the wonderful Acorn Farm I can grow project. We are just so delighted to be part of this and to be given the opportunity to do something so positive for our environment. Having done a little bit of growing in the past, Aine was excited to see the Acorn FarmI can growprojects call out for interest to people in the Derry City and Strabane District area and signed up to be part of it. John really loves checking on the veg and watering the plants and Ive enjoyed getting some tips from the horticulturalist which Ive passed onto friends. Its lovely being able to lt something from your back garden and bring it into the kitchen to cook for dinner. It has been catching too with neighbours popping over to have a look and being inspired to give growing a go themselves.     Mayor Warke congratulated the pair, saying, It fills me with pride to see a local family like the Kivlehans doing their bit for the environment and turning their hand to growing their own food. Not only is this a lovely bonding activity for families, but it saves money and helps our environment too, reducing our reliance on importing fruit and vegetables from farther afield. This helps cut carbon emissions and eases the pressures on nature. One of the positive things about the pandemic is how it has prompted people to connect to nature and start thinking about the journey of food and how we can become more self-sufficient and sustainable.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCity of Derry airport welcomes a new route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Paul Lavilleand James Donaghy, MD of Donaghy Bros, at the awards.Local NewsCounty Derry electrical retailer collects top award in London overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have urged the public in Derry to be vigilant towards scammersLocal NewsPolice warn Derry smartphone users of scammers overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry teenager bit officer on the leg and spat at police overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sir Gerry Robinson became well-known as a television presenter fronting BBC programmes including Troubleshooter and Can Gerry Robinson Fix the NHSNational NewsDeath announced of Sir Gerry Robinson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCity of Derry airport welcomes a new route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Paul Lavilleand James Donaghy, MD of Donaghy Bros, at the awards.Local NewsCounty Derry electrical retailer collects top award in London overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have urged the public in Derry to be vigilant towards scammersLocal NewsPolice warn Derry smartphone users of scammers overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry teenager bit officer on the leg and spat at police overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sir Gerry Robinson became well-known as a television presenter fronting BBC programmes including Troubleshooter and Can Gerry Robinson Fix the NHSNational NewsDeath announced of Sir Gerry Robinson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Rory Conway, of Roshure Road, Magherafelt, contested a charge of driving with excess alcohol on his breath at Magherafelt Magistrates Court last week. The court heard from a police constable who had attended a call from two female witnesses who had followed the defendant home along the Draperstown Road and Roshure Road on September  . googletag.cmd.push The constable told the court he spoke to the witnesses outside the property who said they had seen the defendant at a petrol station in Draperstown and observing he was driving all over the road, had followed him and called the police. After speaking with the witnesses, the constable located a car in the driveway of the house on Roshure Road, and noted the bonnet was still warm. Conways partner answered the door, and when askedthe owner of the vehicle was home, the defendant, who had been in bed, appeared downstairs. The constable noted a smell of intoxicating liquor from Conway and conducted a preliminary breath test, where a reading of mg was recorded. The defendant was then arrested and taken to custody and on leaving after police interview, said: “Boys, it would have been worseyoud got me in the car.” Defence for Conway argued that as the comment had not been taken down in the constables notebook and read and signed by the defendant, it was inadmissible in court. They also said there was no evidence of the defendant driving the car, as both his partner and father had access to it.     The constable said he was not aware of anyone  inside the property at the time, and that the witnesses had described a male suspect. Statements given by the witnesses were then partially read out in court by Judge Mullan. One witness said she had observed Conway getting out of the car and urinating against the garage, before she asked him: “What do you think youre doing ” The statement said the defendant replied “What ” and moved towards the car, prompting the witness to ask: “Where are you going  You nearly caused an accident there.” Conway replied “Im sorry, Im going to my bed,” before the witness went round the back of the house and observed him at the side window with no shirt on, looking out at them. Counsel for the defence said the details in the statement meant that the witnesses should have been able to identy the defendant as part of the Viper procedure, which they were unable to do. Summing up, they told the court the defendant had not been detected driving the vehicle, that his unsolicited comment had been inadmissible and that he had not been identied by witnesses. The prosecution submitted that Conway was the owner of the vehicle and that there were two witnesses to his driving who were so concerned they had followed him home. Police had found the bonnet of the car to be warm, had spoken to the defendant and noted there didnt appear to be anyone  in the house. It was also noted Conway did not deny the charge at interview. Judge Mullan found the defendant guilty of driving with excess alcohol on his breath, and said the failure of the defence to call Conway to give evidence was a factor in the decision. She disqualied the defendant from driving for a period of  months, and issued a fine of pound, alongside an offenders levy of pound.

With the next Assembly election only months away, the campaign rhetoric has already started – and turned sour – with unionists openly mooting exploiting a loophole that could deny Sinn Feacutein or the SDLP the First Minister role should either be the largest party in Stormont. googletag.cmd.push Cllr Harkin of People Before Profit, while angered by the political manoeuvring is not entirely surprised that there are those seeking to pushing the boundaries saying “democracy has always been a sham” at Stormont. He said: “The threat by the DUP, UUP and TUV to refuse a First Minister they dont agree with harks back to the worst of the sectarian unionist veto. “While its no surprise, it does expose the hypocrisy of parties with pretensions to upholding democracy. “This isnt just an insult to nationalists, it is an insult to everyone who believes in democracy. There is an ever increasing number of people who identy as neither unionist or nationalist. “We share the sense of outrage many people feel. The veto on democracy must go. “The Civil Rights movement arose as a people power challenge to a sectarian Stormont regime for basic democratic rights. “Every democratic demand for equality was resisted, often violently, by those prepared to determined to defend the status quo. “The new Stormont purports to be a democratic institution, however, it is anything but. State sectarianism is still embedded in the new Stormont political carve-up.     “In Stormont, establishment unionism and nationalism, dismissed workers rights, womens rights, LGBTQ rights, respect for the Irish language and racial equality for decades.“ “Political establishment parties have shted on some of these demands, certainly not all and not far enough, because of relentless people power campaigning. “But the kneejerk anti-democratic instincts of all the governing parties isnt far from the surface. “The shocking undemocratic treatment of the Black Lives Matter protests was greenlighted and subsequently rubber-stamped by all five of the Executive parties. “Democratic access to the right to choose  None of the five Executive parties are making a fuss about the continued denial of abortion services. “The whitewashed investigation of the ash for cash RHI scandal is another example of how the new Stormont regime has been prepared to trample on democracy. “The failure of the Stormont Executive to implement an anti-poverty strategy tramples on human rights and basic democracy. “The same applies to the refusal of the Executive to undo decades of undemocratic neglect of Derry and the North West thats evident in the failure to expand Magee, upgrade infrastructure or build adequate housing. “In the old and new Stormont, democracy has always been a sham. “Stormont has proved incapable of meeting the basic needs of the vast majority of people. Whether its an insulting pay offer for health heroes, doing nothing as people are pushed over a poverty clf edge or ensuring womens rights. “As with the Civil Rights movement of the s, people power will be the key to extending democracy and creating a more equal society.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCity of Derry airport welcomes a new route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Paul Lavilleand James Donaghy, MD of Donaghy Bros, at the awards.Local NewsCounty Derry electrical retailer collects top award in London overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have urged the public in Derry to be vigilant towards scammersLocal NewsPolice warn Derry smartphone users of scammers overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry teenager bit officer on the leg and spat at police overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sir Gerry Robinson became well-known as a television presenter fronting BBC programmes including Troubleshooter and Can Gerry Robinson Fix the NHSNational NewsDeath announced of Sir Gerry Robinson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The Sinn Feacutein Councillor was commenting after she and Cllr Conor Heaney met with the Irish Government’s Shared Island Unit. The Shared Island Unit is an initiative that sets out the Irish government’s commitment to working with all communities and traditions on the island to build consensus around a shared future, underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement. googletag.cmd.push One of its facets is to further develop an all-island economy that includes investing in the North West and border regions. Cllr. Duffy said: “We had a very positive and constructive discussion with the Shared Island Unit which is based in the Taoiseachs Office and has a budget of pound million so it can certainly help progress the discussion that is already well underway across the island regarding Irish reunication. “We briefed them on the key issues facing the north west including Magee expansion, increasing the Irish Government’s contribution to the A, funding for a Derry to Dublin air link as a gateway to the US and the rest of the world and increasing the financial contribution to the existing City Deal to develop a North West Inclusive Growth Fund. “We also updated them on the Working Group on Irish Unity that Sinn Feacutein established within Derry City and Strabane District Council and agreed to share some of the conclusions from the Working Group as it progresses. “What is emerging from that group already is that there is huge potential for Derry and the North West to thrive economically and socially in a reunied Ireland, given that this area perhaps more than most has been stled by the imposition and impact of partition.”    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times -

Ryanair have confirmed they will operate three weekly flights between Derry and Manchester, England, from Winter . The airline have launched a seat sale to celebrate the announcement of the new route, and their Director of Commercial, Jason McGuinness, said they remain committed to growing their passenger network. googletag.cmd.push Ryanair remains committed to re-building Europe’s aviation and tourism industry by restoring connectivity and growing its network of passengers to over  million by , he said. As Ryanair takes delivery of  additional Boeing - ‘Gamechanger’ aircraft this winter, we are delighted to add this new route from Derry to Manchester. Local MLA for Foyle, Sinead McLaughlin, welcomed news of the new service. This route has long been an ambition of the airport and I congratulate the airports leadership, and Derry City and Strabane District Council as the owners, for getting this over the line, she said. Connections with Manchester are really important for our local economy, as well as being a key destination for study and social reasons. Manchester is a vibrant and dynamic city, which is becoming increasingly signicant within Britain as an economic hub. Creating business links between the two cities could be extremely beneficial for Derry. The City of Derry Airport provides important economic benefits for Derry, as well as the wider region on both sides of the border. It is essential that the Executive and the British and Irish governments provide the ongoing financial support it needs, not just to survive but to expand.

The SDLP leader said that the proposals presented by the Commission this week demonstrate generous flexibility and has called on the British Government to show the same willingness to reach an accommodation. Following the call, Colum Eastwood called on DUP Leader Jeffrey Donaldson to withdraw his threat to collapse the devolved institutions in light of the signicant movement made by EU leaders. googletag.cmd.push Colum Eastwood MP said: “We have had further useful dialogue with Maroš Šefčovič this afternoon. The SDLP is very pleased with the flexibility that the European Commission has shown and the proposals that are now on the table. It is time that we see a similar willingness to reach an honourable accommodation from the British Government. “There will now be a period of intense negotiation. That should be a constructive and relentlessly positive engagement aimed at securing a resolution. I hope that the briefing and counter briefing that has characterised previous talks, particularly in the British Press, will not come to define this negotiation. “In the spirit of seeking accommodation, Jeffrey Donaldson should now withdraw his threat to collapse devolved government in Northern Ireland. Unionism has achieved its goals, there is no further price to be extracted. Continuing to make undeliverable demands around the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice is a hiding to nothing.”     ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCity of Derry airport welcomes a new route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Paul Lavilleand James Donaghy, MD of Donaghy Bros, at the awards.Local NewsCounty Derry electrical retailer collects top award in London overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have urged the public in Derry to be vigilant towards scammersLocal NewsPolice warn Derry smartphone users of scammers overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry teenager bit officer on the leg and spat at police overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sir Gerry Robinson became well-known as a television presenter fronting BBC programmes including Troubleshooter and Can Gerry Robinson Fix the NHSNational NewsDeath announced of Sir Gerry Robinson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Doherty, was a French teacher at Oakgrove College, before a combination of ill-health and redundancy left him twiddling his thumbs at home. Being an aficionado of words, he decided to put those thumbs – and fingers – to artistic use and create the spoonerism series. googletag.cmd.push Spoonerisms derive from error in speech in which corresponding letters are switched between two words in a phrase. The label takes its name from Oxford Don and cleric, William Archibald Spooner who would regularly do this. Sean, who is of the same family that own the citys famous Doherty Meats, said: “I would always do crosswords in the newspapers and I do love words. Sometimes I would spoonerise stuff in my head.  Spooner tries his luck at running a coffee shop. Pic: Sean Doherty “I started noting them down andthey amused me, I would then create wee scenarios for them. “To be honest, I couldnt draw to save myself and I am aware that the cartoons are less than professional. “I was running around trying to get quotes from people to have my cartoons done professionally but the cheapest quote I got was fty pounds a frame. “The wolves are not at the door, but I am on benefits at the minute. The house is paid for and my we is still working, but I still have two children at university so I cant be paying out that much for a professional cartoonist.     “I have a couple of hundred of drawings already created. Even to produce a set of ten would set me back five hundred quid. “I did a google search and came across a teach-yourself-how-to-do-cartoons programme. I went on there and used that to create my spoonerism characters. “The original Spooner was a nineteenth century cleric so naturally, I made one of my main protagonists a cleric as well – a bit like the Father Brown character on TV. “The we character is the one who interprets the spoonerisms, the mistakes with a for flips sake what are you at  and so on. “The cartoons Ive done are very rudimentary but I think as Ive been bouncing along, I got slightly better at it.” As mentioned earlier, Doherty has suffered with ill-health over the last few years with two bouts of Non-Hodgkins Lymphona leading him to take a redundancy offer from Oakfield College and take a break from teaching. He added: “I have had a colourful health history. I have had a number of things over the last ten years. “Im a teacher by trade having taught French at Oakgrove College. I dont do that anymore having had to take my redundancy. “I had my large bowel removed and a stoma bag installed. I recovered from that and went back to work. A couple of years after that, I had massive seizures and was diagnosed with osteoporosis. I broke a dozen bones – including my hip and backbone. “I was in hospital for a month after that. I recovered, went back to work and then I was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma cancer. That was around three or four years ago. “I was successfully treated for it. I was within a few days of being officially declared as being two years clear when I took ill again and found the Non-Hodgkins had ed. “When you get cancer once, your chances of survival are good. When you get it a second time, it can be bleak. “I was lucky enough to have a doctor who was fantastic. He got me onto a thing called Car T Cell Treatment in London. “Its a radical, new treatment, What happens there is they take a sample of your bone marrow and have it sent away to a facility the Netherlands, They convert the bone marrow to fight the cancer internally. “Unfortunately it makes you sick as a pig as you have no immune system. I was in hospital for quite a long time in London. But it was successful – so far, so good, touch wood. “I got sent back to Derry literally just before the pandemic. Im still classied as being clinically extremely vulnerable. “In the middle of all that, I was offered a redundancy from teaching. Being extremely clinically vulnerable and going into eight or nine classrooms a day with dferent sets of pupils is not recommended. “My plan A had been to work as a substitute teacher – and I would have got plenty of work being a language teacher. “But the doctor in London said to leave it until next April and then we could revisit that. For now, I was told that I was not to work as a teacher.”  Spooners Quadrophenia party takes a wrong turn. Pic: Sean Doherty While Doherty awaits for the doctors to give him the green light to resume his teaching career, the Spooner cartoons keep him busy and hopefully someone somewhere might offer him the chance to showcase his material to a wider audience. He said: “I do not claim to be some sort of great artist, but what I have managed to start doing is to give them a character, give them a continued presence and to visually represent a joke. “You might not go oh that is a wonderful cartoon there, but you might see the joke. If youre a wordy sort of a person, you will get the joke. “Of course some might not get the joke and find it funny but I do think there is a niche for spoonerism cartoons.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCity of Derry airport welcomes a new route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Paul Lavilleand James Donaghy, MD of Donaghy Bros, at the awards.Local NewsCounty Derry electrical retailer collects top award in London overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have urged the public in Derry to be vigilant towards scammersLocal NewsPolice warn Derry smartphone users of scammers overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry teenager bit officer on the leg and spat at police overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sir Gerry Robinson became well-known as a television presenter fronting BBC programmes including Troubleshooter and Can Gerry Robinson Fix the NHSNational NewsDeath announced of Sir Gerry Robinson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.         Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

Picture: Nicola Coyle, Irish Whale and Dolphin Group Reporter: Declan Magee Oct Email: declan.magee@iconicnews.ie  addthis, A live pilot whale has been washed up on a Donegal beach. The six-metre whale was found on Rossnowlagh beach on Thursday morning. The live stranding was reported to the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group at around am. The organisation has sent a stranding volunteer to the scene.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall.

at half time.Downpatrick were desperately unlucky not to find the back of the net just minutes into the second half,as McGrady ran clear of the defenders after a looping ball over the topseemed to have caught Clonduff napping.With lsquokeeper Gribben already off his line, he made the decision to challenge McGrady in an aerial dual that the Downpatrick number  managed to win.However, his slapped effort over the head of the Clonduff custodian clipped back off the post and backinto the possession of the grateful Yellas.A minute later and the Hoops were back threatening the opposition defence, but Clonduff held firm when Branniganrsquos lsquorsquo effort dropped into the danger zone.Barry OrsquoHagan punished the Hoops for not taking their chances as his free sailed over the bar, before Downpatrickrsquos Oran Cunningham saw his effort drt wide at the other end.Charlie Carr extended his sidersquos lead with his second point of the game, although Tim Prenter managed to keep the RGU in touch with a no-nonsense score.McConville restored the margin with a left footed strike before his free pushed his side further in front.Darren OrsquoHagan showed no signs of slowing down as he began bossing play with piercing runs and cute passing, allowing the Yellas to put a foothold on the game.Doherty saw his free drt wide off the mark before Close punished the Hoops with a finely taken point to close out the action before the second water-break.Downpatrick knew the clock was against them, but they werenrsquot quite at panic station yet, as Brannigan converted yet another free after teammate Sean Bell was fouled.Clonduff midfielder Ross Carr pointed immediately after before Brannigan once more replied with a free.However, Darren OrsquoHagan began the move that would decide the match, after a string of neat passes and clever off the ball movement allowed his brother Barry to nip in behind the Downpatrick defence before calmly slotting home into the bottom right corner.The now six-point advantage truly seemed to deflate the Downpatrick side who now knew it would take something very special to force extra-time.Despite a Brannigan free, McConville wrapped up the scoring with a lovely left footed strike to ensure it was his Clonduff outfit who would enter the semi-final draw.This signalled the end of the road for the Downpatrick men, who gave a great account of themselves in this yearrsquos competition.Downpatrick: J Deeny, E Rooney , A Doherty, R Murphy, S Bell, J Bell, C Doherty , D Turley, C McCarron, T Prenter , G Collins, C McGrady , J Brannigan , O Cunningham, C Mooney.Subs: T Smyth, P Turley, A Og Robinson, M Fitzpatrick, T Louden, T McNeill, N Cunningham, D Brannf, T Savage, C Boyd, R Og Quinn, C Farrell, G Trainor.Clonduff: P Gribben, J OrsquoHagan, D OrsquoHagan, T McEvoy, L Branagan, C Carr , J Gribben, R Carr, A Carr , T Close , P OrsquoHagan, B OrsquoHagan , A McConville , S McConville, E Brown.Subs: N Trainor, C Brown, R Brannigan, S McGreevy, P Lively, R Lively, T McGreevy, B McConville, P Wilson, J Boden, M McPolin, K OrsquoHagan, F McConville..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Co.jpg","title":"Co Down Rural Community opens new hub in Newcastle  ","story":"THE Co Down Rural Community Network has opened a new wellbeing hub in Newcastle.The new facility is intended to be a central point in the resort to make it easier for people to access information, advice and support and participate in activities to improve their mental and physical health and wellbeing.It will work with iniduals, community members, local groups, and multi-disciplinary teamsto identy community needs and facilitate better access to mental health and wellbeing training and resources.The opening of the new hub is the culmination of the Community Network working with local GPs and primary care teams and the wider community for over  years.Over the past three years, the network has linked up with the MDTs in the local primary care practices.The network has a team of social prescribers and an MDT coordinator who take referrals from GP practices, pharmacists and from other sources and find solutions for people who may be affected by physical limitations or mental health issues or who simply feel isolated in their own homes.This work has intensied during the Covid pandemic, making the opening of the hub even more timely.A total of  people have been referred by the local GPs and their teams to the Community Network since January this year in addition to the  clients that the Social Prescribing team have been working with since .Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairwoman Cathy Mason, who officially opened the news hub on Monday, has described it as a ldquogreat asset for the Community Network team and those who formerly operated a connect and chat service.ldquoGroups of all sorts now have a base to operate from in a beautul and peaceful location.

The project manager Mr Mike Gibb, said Delamont had always been his first option but he could no longer afford to wait on the council.Mr Gibbrsquos announcement dashes hopes that the centre, which is destined to become the largest owl and birds of prey rescue facility in Europe, would come to Killyleagh.Mr Gibb had entered negotiations with Down Council last year regarding the possible construction of the sanctuary at Delamont.But the project became the subject of controversial debates within the council chamber earlier this year amid accusations that council officials were dragging their heels about the proposal, leading Mr Gibb to look for alternative locations.CLOUGH ndash Residents opposing plans for the erection of a BT Cellnet mobile telephone mast in Clough have formed an action group to try and block the plan.At a meeting in the village on Monday, residents got together after they heard local environmentalist, Walter Graham, outlined the drawbacks and health risks associated with these masts.Plans for the -metre mast which,approved, will be sited within the Watsonrsquos filling station complex, were published several weeks ago andaccepted could be operating within months.Up to  residents gathered in the Old School House, just a stonersquos throw from the proposed site, to hear of the risks and implications these masts are believed to cause.Villagers heard how the transmitter could dominate the skyline, towering over homes, a primary school, petrol station and an old peoplersquos home.Claiming that scientists believed the growth of cancers were ldquospurred on by the transmitters, he said. ldquoIf this mast goes up my children are coming out of school, there is no way they will study in the shadow of that mast.

The Trust told us recently that the urgent care centre is lsquomeeting the needs of the publicrsquo but one really has to wonder how this opinion has been formed, said Mrs Trainor.Appealing for increased investment at the Downe site, health campaigners say that the hospital has the capability to do much more.The say the hospitalrsquos bed capacity must be extended to help meet the needs of local communities but also to help address the regional beds shortage caused by the large cut in capacity across Northern Ireland ldquowhich has been brutally exposed during the Covid crisis.The campaigners added: ldquoThe South Eastern Trust should now be looking at a large extension to the hospital, creating new capacity, away from over congested centralised sites, levelling up rural inequality in healthcare provision.

Villa had half chances too at the opposite end with Jake Wilson going close to an equaliser.Then came that dramatic finale. Wilson was presented with a second chance in the box after his initial effort was saved and he produced a stunning finish high into the net from a tight angle.Cue th minute pandemonium and it seemed the tie was set for extra time.But when the game was restarted Killyleagh won a corner and after two blocks at close range the ball was eventually scrambled over the line by Jon Joe Sharvin in the th minute.The huge crowd contained several former players from the first Killyleagh team to win the Border Cup in  and now Paul Sharvin will be hoping his team get a chance to match that Christmas glory.To reach the semi-finals, however, they must beat Crumlin United on November  ndash a chance to avenge an incredible - defeat when the teams last met in this competition exactly two yearsrsquo ago when Killyleagh tossed away a - half-time lead in the last nine minutes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Slieve.jpg","title":"Slieve Donard sold for £40m  ","story":"NEWCASTLErsquoS iconic Slieve Donard Resort and Spa has been sold in a poundm deal to American investors.Owned by the Hastings family since , the world famous five-star hotel has been acquired by US-based AJ Capital Partners which is planning a major upgrade.After weeks of speculation that the hotel had been sold, the news was finally confirmed last Thursday with the new owner a Nashville-headquartered real estate developer and hotel operator with more than  hotels across the US and Britain, including St Andrews in Scotland.Announcing that the Newcastle hotel has been acquired, AJ Capital also confirmed that renovation work is planned to start in October next year, with the work completed by the following spring.During the planned upgrade, the hotel will remain closed.Howard Hastings mdash the managing director of Hastings Hotels mdash described AJ Capital Partnersrsquos acquisition of the Slieve Donard Resort and Spa as ldquoencouraging news for hospitality and tourism in Northern Ireland.He said it also represented a boost for the burgeoning golf tourism industry which ldquohas been an important driver of local tourism in recent years and shows signicant growth potential in the future.Mr Hastings added: ldquoI have every confidence that AJ Capital Partners will be sympathetic to the heritage of the hotel and that, under their leadership, it will continue to flourish and maintain its reputation as an iconic destination in Northern Ireland.ldquoThis investment is a strong sign of confidence in the local market by a major international hotel operator with exciting ambitions for the Slieve Donard in the coming years.

Or they collect online vouchers for cheap meals at restaurants with inconvenient time constraints. This is the stuff of real le, people doing their best to cope in situations of searing isolation or emotional constipation, grieving, love-lorn, waiting for a triumph that doesn’t come, grappling with disappointment that arrives devoid of sugar-coating. Wendy with her daughter Mathilda, . The author and teacher regards motherhood as her proudest achievementNot that Erskine doesn’t do humour, she does with gusto, but she also “wants people to be moved” by her precise rendering of all the absurd tragicomedy of le as it is lived every day.Erskine, an avid fan of “s girl groups, New Wave and psychedelic music” who gets a glowing . out of  on the Rate My Teacher website for her role at the prestigious east Belfast institution that boasts alumni such as Margaret Mumfordand novelist Lucy Caldwell, dismisses the notion that the ordinary lives of the people of her native city are somehow not rich enough to make appropriate thematic material for fiction.“Somebody might say ‘Oh, you write stories about ordinary people.’ And my response is, yes, but who are these extraordinary people you are talking about  “Because strip away status and artice and we are all ordinary people. Plus, once you get to know ordinary people and understand their lives, they become extraordinary, inidual, special and just as worthy of literary analysis as some powerful hero or heroine.”Erskine, who has a massively high score on the Rate My Teacher website, has just been appointed a fellow of the Seamus Heaney Centre at Queens University Belfast. She is delighted by the opportunity to help fledgling writers improve their creative effortsShe continues: “People ask of my writing, “Is everything going to be set in East Belfast ’ As though people who live in London have lives that are more complex or more exciting, by virtue of the fact that they live in a big metropolis, whereas I really do think I could write collection after collection about people who live on streets here similar to the one I live on. I think their lives are just as rich as any.”So too does she deride the notion that local fiction has some kind of moral imperative to focus on the  years of conflict that so disturbed our peace. Erskine believes that the literary imagination should have unbridled permission to roam free through whatever territory it is intent on exploring: “If you come from Northern Ireland you have an absolute prerogative to write about whatever you wish, whether that is the Troubles, the post-Troubles landscape or novels about turtles or about people playing the guitar or about landscape gardeners. “There shouldn’t be any expectation about what you decide to write about. ANGEL FACE: Wendy as a baby, long, long before literary fame beckoned“With me, what I’m thinking about is that there is no sort of homogenous Northern Ireland le where you live or whatever social class you come from doesn’t mean that your experience is any less worthy of exploration or any less profound.”She is interested in characters on the margins navigating lives that may seem nondescript from the outside, but are charged with an emotional valence, poignancy and levity so that, as Erskine intends, “people may laugh, but I also very much want them to be moved. I could write a story that is simply funny ha-ha, but that would not be true to the complexity of human experience. “In the same way to centre my literary focus solely on melancholy would also be to deny that le is an absurd tragicomedy composed of darkness and light. To go back to Blake, “joy and woe are woven fine”.“That is very much the philosophy behind the fiction I try to write.”‘QUIET STOICISM OF ULSTER PEOPLE COMPELLS ME’Erskine’s first foray into creative writing began when she was offered an afternoon off amidst her hectic schedule as head of the English department at Strathearn Grammar.Though tempted to “join the gym, volunteer in an art gallery or mooch around coffee shops reading magazines or watching make-up tutorial videos on YouTube which I endlessly love,”, she saw a Facebook ad for a six-month writing course at the Irish Writers Centre, a lofty Georgian edice on Dublin’s Parnell Square, run by The Stinging Fly magazine. She committed to it in  after submitting a story named Locksmiths, the idea for which came to her while regrouting her bathroom floor and stripping away the layers of paint and wallpaper left by previous owners of her home.It is about a woman engaged in the optimism of a DIY project while the Troubles rage on her doorstep: “I’m interested in people on the side-lines, those who aren’t the centre of attention, the lives quietly lived. There are plenty of characters like that in the collection. Quiet stoicism compells me.” ‘I LOVE THE CITY, CONCRETE, TOWER BLOCKS, STREETS, BOOKSHOPS AND MARGARITAS’Wendy had a happy childhood, and with her brother would be taken to the library once a week by their mother,who kept “random” books in the family home in Jordanstown.She inherited her mother’s love of reading, and delighted in creative writing exercises at Belfast High School, situated between Whiteabbey and Greenisland: “We used to be given a Mars bar at the end of the classwe did well, which was absolutely blissful for me.”She went on to study English at university in Glasgow before going into teaching there and then in Newcastle Upon Tyne before relocating to home, sweet home.“I always wanted to study English, because reading was my thing more than anything . I think Hemingway said that ‘the good parts of a book may be only something a writer is lucky enough to overhear, or it may be the wreck of his le, and one is as good as the other.’”Though she is a dedicated teacher who delights in her colleagues, pupils, the discussion of literature and a school she loves so much she has stayed for over two decades, as well as a much feted writer of short stories, Wendy considers her greatest achievement to date as being mum to her two children Mathilda,  and son Bobby, , whom she shares with art teacher Paul, whom she met on herto Belfast in .“I’ve never found parenting stressful, it’s been more like this joyous voyage into uncharted territory and I am very proud of the fact that my children have grown up to become two lovely human beings,” she confides.The secret to her longevity with husband Paul “Spending substantial time apart and having separate interests as well as being able to totally enjoy each other’s company. You need to be self-sufficient iniduals as well as a couple.”And despite being an enormous bookworm, who especially adores the Russian master of the short story Anton Chekov, Wendy is also something of a fashionista who stocks clobber by The Vampire’s We, Isabel Marant and western shirts in her wardrobe as well as a panoply of finds she bought on Ebay for next to nothing.

I love tower blocks and streets, browsing in bookshops and going to a nice old bar with lots of red velvet for margaritas.”QA: ‘I’D HAVE MARY SHELLY, GENE CLARK AND LOU REED TO DINNER’Tell us some of your earliest childhood memories Hearing my Mum and Dad have a conversation about how they didn’t think The Beatles were that good. Also, trying to bang an Ormeau Easter egg on the side of a chair to break it open to get the little fluffy plastic chick that was inside.School days - what subjects did you excel at and were you ever in trouble Not surprisingly, English was my favourite subject and I always loved it. I don’t think I was a real goodie-goodie though, I always liked make-up, eyeliner, back combing my hair and wearing a lipstick I remember that used to change colour. So I would have got into trouble sometimes because of my attempts at aesthetic improvement, for sure.Who in your le makes you laugh the most Probably my Mum who is . She’s very funny and has a very particular wit and original way of looking at the world. She’s very aware of the ridiculousness of things.Who is your best friend My husband of over  years, Paul.Some of your favourite books The Sound and The Fury by William Faulkner, Sea State by Tabitha Lasley and The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison.Favourite film Once Upon A Time in the West, directed by Sergio Leone.If you could invite anyone from history to an ideal dinner party who would you bring and what would you serve them I would % have Mary Shelley. Then Gene Clark from The Byrds and The Velvet Underground’s Lou Reed. I’d serve a great big plate of nice breads and cheeses and meats so that I could sit and enjoy their company with minimal effort, although I think Mary Shelley was vegetarian, so no meat for her.Can you describe yourself in three words Disciplined, frivolous, observant.How much do you enjoy teaching I’ve worked at Strathearn since  and that is an indicator of how much I love the place. It’s the kind of job where every day is dferent, and there is always something interesting going on. I love the discussion of literature above all.You’ve recently been made a fellow of the Seamus Heaney Centre at Queen’s. What does this mean to you Before I began to write I’d always loved reading other people’s writing, first as a student, then as a teacher. Being a writer can be lonely, so what I really look forward to is being able to help writers, whatever their age or background, find a way to improve their creative endeavours. To collaborate with somebody on making a piece of creative writing as powerful as it can be will be a huge privilege for me.Love is...Essential.The meaning of le is...Not always apparent.Dance Moves by Wendy Erskine will be published by Stinging Fly and Picador in February ."},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/resources/images/12933752.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

With all things considered, officers recommended the delivery of option two.The rural towns officers included in the report are Donaghcloney, Keady, Richhill, Tandragee and Waringstown.DUP group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter proposed the officers’ recommendation to go with the festive drive in experience and said “it would be very welcome, especially in those rural communities”.Councillor Paul Berry welcomed the proposal but noted Markethill was not included in the list of towns mentioned and proposed it was included.Council’s head of economic development services, Nicola Wilson confirmed Markethill could be includedcouncillors want.Noting Council has a duty of care to the general public, Councillor Kyle Savage seconded the proposal to accept the recommendation and praised council officersfor “taking and showing true leadership” with this recommendation.Noting he was happy to go with the proposal for the festive drive-in, despite public health regulations relaxing further at the end of October, Councillor Sam Nicholson said he would second Cllr Berry’s proposal to include Markethill in the proposal.“I support Cllr Berry’s call to include Markethill. It is one of our most thriving and vibrant market towns,” he said.“If Councillor Berry is making a proposal to include it, I am happy to second it.”Alderman Ian Burns said he was fully supportive of the proposal but called for the towns of Gilford and Rathfriland to also be recognised.Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon said he would prefer to see twilight markets in the rural towns but with the movie night proposal he would want to ensure that “providing it can be worked into costs, it is run in as many of our rural towns as possible”.Alderman Jim Speers said he had discussed this issue “at ” with Council officers and acknowledged the need for as many places as possible to get an event like this.“I am very supportive of the need to have this event in Markethill butwe do that in one place other towns will feel they have been short-changed.“I have already had that conversation with officers and I would like to see us get to the point where this is rolled out across the area.”The committee then voiced its approval for Councillor Baxter’s proposal to recommend the movie night and free Christmas Eve car parking is approved and Cllr Berry’s proposal to incorporate as many smaller towns as budgets will allow.Read this:- Driving tests ‘crisis’Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.

However, our vaccination teams time and time again have risen to the challenge when called upon, and this week will be no dferent. “I would encourage everyone and anyone who has not yet received a second dose vaccination to take this opportunity to do so. If you missed your second dose appointment for whatever reason, this is the most accessible way for you to ensure you are fully vaccinated. Just come along to one of our three centres and our staff will be happy to help. “Vaccination is saving lives. When we get jabbed, we are protecting ourselves, protecting others and protecting the health service. It is the single biggest contribution people can make to getting normality back.
