Nothing more to it than that.\u0027Sir Keir repeated his apology for questioning the truth of Mr Johnson\u0027s statement that the Opposition leader had previously said it would be better for the UK to remain a member of the European Union\u0027s medicines regulator.The former director of public prosecutions had said Mr Johnson was talking \u0027complete nonsense\u0027 after the Conservative Party leader accused him of repeatedly calling for the UK to stay in the EMA, suggesting such a move would have hampered the country\u0027s Covid-19 vaccine rollout.Sir Keir apologised for the error after it was pointed out that Hansard, the official record of Parliament, had recorded him in January 2017 questioning why the UK would want to leave the EMA and that it should be something retained as part of the Brexit process.\u0027I had misheard what the Prime Minister was putting to me, I was wrong about that and, as I say, hands up, I got it wrong. Better to say that and just be straight about it,\u0027 he told broadcasters during his visit to a vaccination centre at an Asda supermarket in Watford."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53864320db818e55c050e752044cc8cb82b70bde/0_202_3614_2169/master/3614.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1a1b7c966687c9c769ab77d2de42c21","title":"abstract genius ray k metzker photographs in pictures","story":"A new exhibition showcases the American virtuoso’s bold and experimental way of working.

BoE policymakers stressed that the request did not mean a cut in borrowing costs below zero was imminent or even likely, but with few tools left to boost the economy in the event of a downturn, the central bank needs negative rates to be available as an option.How do negative interest rates work?Instead of earning interest on money left with the Bank of England, when rates are negative banks are charged to park their cash with the central bank.The European Central Bank, the Swiss and Danish central banks and Bank of Japan charge local banks to deposit money in the hope this will encourage them to stop hoarding funds, and instead lend more to each other, to consumers, and to businesses, in turn boosting the broader economy.What would happen to my mortgage?If it’s a fixed-rate mortgage, nothing will happen if interest rates are cut. Most households are on this type of deal in recent years about nine in 10 new mortgages have been taken on a fixed rate.What would happen to housebuyers arranging a mortgage?New mortgages may get cheaper, but rates for borrowers with large deposits are already low. Lenders could increase the margins on new tracker mortgages, so that the percentage rate you pay above the base rate is higher than on the current deals. Lenders are likely to ensure that they have a lower limit in their terms and conditions because they do not want to pay borrowers who have mortgages with them.What would it mean for savers?Wealthy savers could face a charge for holding large sums of money on deposit. UBS charges ultra-rich clients a fee for cash savings of more than €500,000 (£438,000), and reportedly plans to lower that threshold later this year. And at the Danish Jyske Bank, similar charges apply.It could also mean that banks start to consider fees for current accounts. HSBC has already said that low interest rates could lead to it introducing fees on its accounts.What about loans and credit cards?Rates on personal loans are already low and are typically fixed once you take them out, so a negative interest rate will not affect your repayments.Credit card rates are usually low for new customers, but rise far above the base rate once introductory periods have ended, so will not be anywhere close to falling into negative territory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72375d4f23565a5ff0a27ede483eba0b7df94964/115_0_3148_1890/master/3148.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=2a51f2c52f1ed608800c41b29e760d23","title":"wales schools reooen children foundation phase 22 february","story":"Decision follows Scottish plans for return to classrooms while schools in England will not reopen before MarchChildren in Wales will begin to return to school in person after the half-term holiday later this month, the Welsh government is to announce on Friday.It follows an announcement from the Scottish government earlier this week which said that children in the first three years of primary school will return to classrooms from 22 February.Kirsty Williams, the Welsh education minister, is expected to announce that children in the foundation phase – those up to the age of seven – can also return on the same date.But the government in England has said its schools would not reopen before March, despite pressure from a core group of Tory dissenters as well as William Wragg and Robert Halfon, Conservative MPs who chair high-profile parliamentary committees.Following Scotland’s announcement, Boris Johnson reaffirmed that the earliest moment the government in England could make a decision was 15 February, when it will have received further data about the vaccination rollout and more details on community transmission.Gavin Williamson, the education secretary for England, has pledged that schools will be given at least two weeks’ notice of any reopening, meaning that the earliest possible date from 15 February would be 1 March.But No 10 would prefer for schools to reopen fully to all year groups rather than a phased return of few year groups of primary schoolchildren and appears highly likely to stick to its predicted earliest date of 8 March. In Northern Ireland, where community transmission remains high, schools will also not fully reopen until 8 March at the earliest.In all four countries, schools and colleges have remained open throughout lockdowns for the children of critical workers and for those children classed as vulnerable.The decision by the Cardiff administration follows a rapid fall in community cases of Covid-19 infections in Wales since Christmas. The country also had just 13 confirmed or probable cases of the South African variant earlier this week, with 10 having a travel link to southern Africa and the three under investigation.Mark Drakeford, Welsh first minister, had earlier said that a “phased and flexible” return to school this month for some pupils was being planned when it was safe to do so.Teaching unions are said to be unhappy with the Welsh decision, which would see full class sizes readmitted and no additional mitigation measures.The unions have presented the Welsh government with a list of measures their members wanted in place before returning, including strict social distancing and medical grade masks to be worn by foundation phase teachers.The Association of School and College Leaders Cymru has previously called for the Welsh government to publish scientific advice and modelling on the impact the return of pupils to classrooms would have."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/372d097bfeed5b726ab0db207c6a7235a957abe1/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=ad058420878ffc14353e8a36973a469a","title":"money spent on film and tv production in uk down 21 in 2020","story":"Investment in high-end TV shows overtook that of film for first time, according to BFI figures The amount spent in the UK on making Hollywood films, such as Batman, and prestige dramas including Netflix’s The Witcher slumped by more than £700m to £2.8bn last year as the pandemic took its toll on the film and TV production industry.The figures also underlined the rise in high-end TV shows costing at least £1m an episode, with the amount spent overtaking that invested in film-making in the UK for the first time.The streaming wars have been led by Netflix and Amazon but the shift in viewing habits has also encouraged the BBC, Sky and ITV to invest more in big budget shows. The move has fuelled a boom in UK-made shows from Netflix’s The Crown and Sky’s Britannia to the BBC’s War of the World’s and Amazon’s Outlander.The BFI’s annual report also highlights the torrid time cinema owners continue to experience as venues either remained closed for extended periods, or were starved of blockbuster content in the brief period when they welcomed back audiences.“It has been a challenging year for cinema but we remain optimistic for the day when we can welcome back audiences,” said Ben Roberts, the chief executive of the BFI.The BFI preferred to focus on the huge return of spend as the year drew to a close, thanks to initiatives such as the government-backed insurance scheme to protect against Covid shutdowns and facilities being repurposed with virus transmission safety measures in place.Almost £1.2bn was spent on film and TV production in the final three months of last year, the second highest ever quarterly spend on record, as broadcasters, Hollywood studios and streamers rushed to get the pipeline flowing to plug the pandemic gap in fresh content viewers were facing.“Last spring it was hard to imagine that we would be generating £1bn worth of production activity in the final quarter,” said Roberts. “This has been achieved by industry and government pulling together and the determination of our workforce to get back up and running.”Last month, Netflix, which spends more than $1bn (£730m) annually on UK-made content, announced it is to release 70 films this year, promising one new release each week, its biggest ever slate. And Sky, which is owned by NBC Universal-parent Comcast, has announced a 125-title film and TV slate for this year. In December, relative streaming newcomer Disney announced a doubling of content spend to $15bn by 2024, as it aims to attract as many as 260m subscribers to its Disney+ streaming service.“Production recovery in the UK is well underway and demand for content is not only still there but in fact greater than ever before,” said Adrian Wootton, chief executive of the British Film Commission, the industry body supporting UK film and TV production."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/110b81da2c6ce48ffe3960a483b60a441e23ac1c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=96938397da7ad36fe3cfa78207f1e4b8","title":"how to make the perfect mouclade mussels recipe felicity cloake","story":"This shellfish winter warmer from western France features plump mussels in a delicately spiced, creamy sauce. But whose version is best?This “lesser-known cousin of moules marinière”, as Nigella describes mouclade, is a speciality of the Poitou-Charentes region in western France, where it started life as a “humble dish for fishermen”, according to Michel Roux. But you don’t have to have been hauling nets all day to appreciate its creamy sauce or delicate spicing, a legacy, it is said, of La Rochelle’s historic role in maritime trade from the east. A favourite of Michel’s brother, the late Albert Roux, who would often, his son says, order a double helping of the starter-sized portion served at Le Gavroche, mouclade is as much of a winter warmer as any hearty seafood stew, but on the table in half the time.Standard procedure here: wash and debeard, as the act of stripping the creature of the threads that once attached it to the surface it grew on, is happily known, before cooking. (Frozen mussels tend to be sold ready-cleaned.)Most mouclade recipes steam the mussels in a dry pan before making a sauce from their juices, but a few, including Michel Roux Jr’s version from his book A Life in the Kitchen and that of Madame Brigitte Ravail (native of Châtelaillon in the Charente-Maritime, featured in the excellent 1981 collection, Les Recettes de Mon Village) steam them with wine and aromatics instead. This, of course, is usual when making something like moules marinière, but mouclade is a two-step process, and picking out bits of semi-raw onion from among the shells is a tedious business.You could get round this by sauteeing the onion first, as Roux Jr recommends, but as his sauce starts with sweated shallots, I don’t see much point in adding onions to the mussels as well. Cooking them in wine, crushed garlic and herb stalks will, however, make them taste even better – the garlic will disappear into the whole, while the stalks can be easily fished out. (If you happen to have dry vermouth or similar, rather than white wine, Lawson recommends you dilute it with the same amount of water – or, if you’d prefer to leave the wine out altogether, Alan Davidson gives a recipe sharpened with lemon juice at the end instead.)Traditionally, it seems, mussels are served on the half shell for mouclade, which tends to be less liquid than marinière, and indeed, the picture in Les Recettes de Mon Village shows a handsome platter one could put in the middle of the table at party, if such things weren’t a distant dream right now. For inidual consumption, I’d leave them whole, because they’ll stay warmer, but do as you prefer – I notice after eating his recipe from the shell that Roux picks them all out before serving, which is a good idea if you’re going to have them as a main course with rice, as his late uncle Michel Roux recommends in The Essence of French Cooking.Nigella Lawson’s avowedly quick one-pot take, from Nigella Express, simplifies the process to one very similar to a marinière, and is to be recommended if you’re in a tearing hurry for mussels, but truth be told, it’s not a great faff either way.Some sort of allium makes a nice base for the sauce: you could use onion, but I like the sweetness of Roux’s shallots, or Lawson’s baby leeks, with the saltiness of the seafood. (Larousse Gastronomique and Davidson’s classic North Atlantic Seafood both use garlic, but that’s already in the cooking liquor, so it doesn’t seem necessary to include it twice.)Herb wise, I’m going to keep things simple, because I’d like spice to be the principal flavour. I’m leaving out Ravail’s bay leaf, Roux’s thyme, Julia Child’s fennel and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Nick Fisher’s lovage leaves from The River Cottage Fish Book in favour of the stalks of the parsley whose leaves will eventually garnish the dish.Spice is the defining characteristic of mouclade. Davidson, who came across the dish at Restaurant de la Marée at La Rochelle, reports that, despite the busy-ness of the service, “I was able to ask whether their mouclade contained saffron. The answer was that when real saffron was available at a reasonable price, a touch of it would be added at the last moment, but that curcuma (turmeric) made a satisfactory substitute.” Larousse suggests curry powder or saffron, and Ravail, Roux and Lawson curry powder, with Roux calling for mild and Lawson medium. Turmeric gives glorious colour, but not much in the way of flavour, while subtle saffron struggles against the seafood and garlic, so I think curry powder, a blend that now pops up more in French than in British cooking, is by far the best bet, being fuller flavoured, yet gently warming rather than overtly hot.Instead of being served in the thin broth familiar from the marinière preparation, the mussels in mouclade are, as Larousse explains, “coated” with a sauce made from “their cooking liquid enriched with cream and butter”. Larousse and Davidson’s sauces both start with a butter-heavy roux, while the rest use dairy as a thickening agent – creme fraiche for Ravail, double cream for Roux and Lawson – with Davidson finishing his by beating in an egg yolk.All are, of course, delicious, but the simplicity of Roux’s version – the reduced cooking liquid mixed with cream – appeals most, with its velvety texture and rich flavour. Serve with a scattering of peppery parsley, and some bread or rice to mop it all up.Prep 15 minCook 20 minServes 2 as a light meal, or 1 greedy person1kg mussels2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1 small bunch parsley, leaves picked and stalks reserved150ml dry white wine1 tbsp butter2 shallots, peeled and finely chopped2 tsp curry powder100ml double cream or creme fraicheSalt and black pepperRinse and clean the mussels in cold water, tugging off any beards and discarding any with badly broken shells. (Don’t worry about open or closed ones at this point.)Put in a large pan with the garlic, parsley stalks (they’re easier to pick out if you leave them in one piece) and wine, cover and cook over a medium-low heat, shaking the pan occasionally to move the mussels around, until the shells open.Drain the mussels through a fine sieve set over a heatproof bowl to catch the cooking liquor. If you’d like to serve the mussels on the half shell, or shelled full stop, do this now, working quickly so they stay warm. Discard any shells that have remained tightly closed.Melt the butter in a medium pan and fry the shallots until soft. Stir in the curry powder, cook for a minute or so, then add the mussel cooking liquid and bring to a simmer. Bubble until reduced by about half. Meanwhile, finely chop the parsley leaves.Take the pan off the heat and stir in the cream.Season to taste, then ide the mussels between bowls and pour over the sauce (or stir the shelled mussels into the sauce before serving).

Some light wrestling, followed by a bit of theatrical frowning, nothing more. The referee reminds both players that they’re grown adults, and we play on.76 min: Werner slips a ball down the inside-left channel for Mount, who aims low and hard towards the bottom right. Lloris parries clear. Spurs are living dangerously.74 min: Rudiger sprays a pass down the left. He finds Werner, whose shot is blocked. James picks up the rebound and shoots. Blocked. Finally Pulisic has a go. A third block.73 min: Kovacic is replaced by Kante as Chelsea look to shore it up.72 min: Son earns a corner off Rudiger down the right. He takes it short, and quickly. Lamela crosses Christensen heads clear. A reminder that, for all Chelsea’s dominance, parity is still well within reach for Spurs.71 min: It’s Pulisic’s turn to drive down the middle at speed. He’s got Werner to his left, but delays the pass, and instead of sending his team-mate clear in the box, is upended fairly by Davies.69 min: Here’s Justin Kavanagh re my half-time ‘jobby’ count: “it’s not often indeed, Scott. And I reckon if Mourhino continues producing this jobby, he’ll soon be out of a jobby. There, I’ve doubled your daily Scrabble score.” To this end, Jose sends on Moura and Lamela in place of Ndombele and Bergwijn.68 min: Kovacic strides down the middle with extreme prejudice. He’s got Werner and Mount either side, but opts to go himself. He bobbles a shot wide left. Wonderful run, dismal finish. Ultimately very poor.66 min: Some heroics in the Spurs goal from Lloris. First off, a header off his own line, Dier nearly chipping his own keeper with an absurdly strong looping backpass. Great improvisation. Then Mount swings one in from the right, Lloris punching clear under extreme pressure, just in time as well, from Pulisic, who was extending to poke home.65 min: Chelsea make their second change of the evening, swapping Hudson-Odoi for Pulisic.64 min: Werner works his way down the left and fizzes an extremely tempting cross through the six-yard box. Nobody in Chelsea blue has taken a gamble, though. James retrieves the ball on the right, and tees up Alonso, who lashes wildly over the bar from the edge of the box.63 min: Hojbjerg breaks the monotony by clattering into Jorginho, earning himself a pointless booking.62 min: It’s all gone a bit scrappy.60 min: One corner leads to another. From the second, the ball drops to Rudiger at the far post. He chests down. Dier blocks again, less painfully this time. The flag goes up for offside anyway. “I’m just wondering if the phrase ‘valid journalistic reasons’ has ever been seen within a country mile of the Fiver.” Some harsh but ultimately fair analysis from Daniel Strauss.59 min: Mount glides down the middle at top speed. He slips a pass to Werner, just inside the box on the left. Werner opens his body to shoot. Aurier nips in from the back, just in time, to toe-poke out for a corner on the right.58 min: Chelsea ping it around in the sterile fashion. The Spurs snap has slowed a little.56 min: Chelsea are beginning to rediscover that verve. Kovacic sashays down the middle of the park, one-twos with Mount, and gets a snapshot off. Dier blocks with his trouser arrangement. Ooyah, oof. That’s gotta hurt. He goes down to attend to his special area, but he’s up again soon enough.54 min: Hudson-Odoi, to the right of the D, drags a low diagonal shot wide left of the post. Not too far away from a second goal that would put Spurs under serious pressure.53 min: Spurs are snapping at Chelsea’ heels. A little too much here, as Davies clips James. Still, another ref might have allowed play to go on, in which case Vinicius would have latched onto the loose ball and romped into the box from the left.52 min: Spurs are playing at a significantly higher tempo, albeit for little reward so far. But they have put a stop to Chelsea’s first-half gallop. The visitors haven’t rediscovered their rhythm since the restart.50 min: Mount spins Alderweireld on the halfway line, and is hacked down for his trouble. A booking for the Spurs defender. No argument.48 min: Mendy plays an absurdly risky pass out from the back. Son rolls Jorginho and the ball breaks to Ndombele, in space on the edge of the box. The whistle goes for a pretty generous foul. The Chelsea keeper got away with one there. Spurs are within their rights to be a bit annoyed about that.47 min: It is now really pelting down at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The pitch is getting pretty sodden. Davies flings a cross in from the left, forcing Alonso to turn the ball behind for a corner. Nothing comes of it, but some promising early signs that Spurs are finally coming out to play.Spurs, who surely can’t continue to play as listlessly, get the second half underway. They have to do something. No changes. “I reckon if fans had been in the ground for the last few games, Mourinho’s position would be in serious doubt,” argues Martin Gamage. “Spurs are playing with such a lack of ambition it’s almost breathtaking in its own way.” Half-time entertainment. It’s not often there are valid journalistic reasons for repeatedly using the word “jobby” while working for a broadsheet newspaper. You’ve got to seize these extremely rare opportunities when they present themselves. A banner day. Don’t die wondering, folks.There’s just enough time for Mount to line up a shot from the edge of the Spurs box. Dier deflects it into the arms of Lloris, and the whistle goes. This half-time scoreline flatters Spurs. Mourinho, face like thunder, is down the tunnel like a flash. Cue trenchant discussion in the home dressing room?45 min: Son drives purposefully down the left, but there are no options for him in the middle. He’ll be counting down the days until Kane’s return. Meanwhile the referee will be counting down two added minutes.44 min: The half is petering out. “José would seem to be saving his players for the League Cup final, but is completely unaware it has been rescheduled from February to April,” quips Gary Byrne.42 min: A free kick for Spurs out on the right, and a chance for Spurs to worry Chelsea at long last. Son curls it in nicely. Aurier rises above everyone and sends a downward header wide right from eight yards. He should probably have done better, but that’ll give the hosts a little succour. For all Chelsea’s dominance, Spurs came very close to equalising there.40 min: Hudson-Odoi’s work down the right wins Chelsea’s fifth corner of the evening. Mount and Hudson-Odoi exchange clever passes, opening up space with Spurs snoozing. Mount’s got time and space in the box, but seriously overcooks a cross that flies over the bar in the rugby-union style. A real let-off for Spurs, who had switched off.38 min: Chelsea have sure been impressive, but it’s also the case that Spurs have been abysmal so far. A rare occasion where the home side are probably happy the fans are absent. By way of illustration, here’s Guy Hornsby: “This is fun isn’t it. When is José going to realise that Eric Dier isn’t a centre back? It was a brainless challenge in the box. Our back four looks like a bunch of under-11s.”36 min: A dejected Silva is helped off down the tunnel. He’s replaced by Christensen. “Tottenham Hotspur do know that it’s the team that score more goals that wins the match don’t they?” asks Gary Naylor, of a glory-glory club that certainly used to.34 min: Everything’s gone to plan for Chelsea so far. But this is an unwelcome sight for them. Silva looks to have pulled something while executing an acrobatic clearance upfield. He’s prone on the turf, wearing the expression of a man who knows his race is run.32 min: By contrast, Spurs have achieved next to nothing in attack. There’s very little movement.

But following a trading frenzy the stock began to fall, almost as quickly as it had risenAt the beginning of the year, not many people were paying attention to GameStop. Its business of selling video games in retail stores looked increasingly shaky as the market shifted ever more online in the grip of the Covid-19 pandemic. GameStop’s seemingly grim prospects led Wall Street hedge funds to take out big bets on the company’s share price falling further (known as short selling) but they had not reckoned with a force that was about to blow them away. Users of the Reddit messageboard WallStreetBets began grouping together to buy huge quantities of GameStop’s stock, driving the share price higher and higher and inflicting huge losses on the hedge fund titans.  Desmund Delaney tells Rachel Humphreys that as part of the Reddit community he was tipping shares in GameStop back in 2019 and took his own advice investing in the company, despite the derision of other users. But he gave up on the company last year while its share price was below $10 and cashed out. If he’d sold last week he would be sitting on half a million dollars.  Economist Dan Davies explains that while the phenomenon of an online community-driven stock market bubble feels new and exciting, it’s a story as old as the markets themselves. A group of investors egg each other on to speculatively jack up the price of shares they are holding – only for the whole thing to come crashing down. In the case of GameStop, it may have burned some incautious hedge fund managers, but the steep decline in the share price this week has proved to be a sharp lesson for amateur investors who didn’t sell up before the crash began. Are online forums a new force on Wall Street? Or are the odds still stacked too steeply against them?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b7a7fcc6913c8f30d9a8445f53a7674befc8fb4/0_220_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=022aab0afc2d3894b134e4f862b11cae","title":"even low levels of gambling linked to financial hardship study finds","story":"People who bet even relatively small sums are more likely to suffer financial hardship and unemployment, while heavier gamblers die earlier, according to a landmark study analysing data from millions of bank customers.In a report thought to be the largest of its kind carried out in the UK, academics tracked the links between gambling spend and problems experienced by 6.5 million Lloyds Banking Group customers over seven years.They found that the likelihood of missing a mortgage payment, taking a payday loan or being pursued by debt collectors escalated rapidly the more someone gambled, while there were longer-term links to job loss and mortality.The study, led by academics at Oxford and Warwick universities, will intensify concern about the volume of gambling company profits derived from people in financial difficulty. The industry is already under scrutiny amid a government review that could yield tougher regulation.The research gives the most detailed insight yet into how the £14.5bn that the industry wins from punters each year can translate into damaging real-world outcomes.The researchers also traced gambling spend over a seven-year period, identifying increased rates of unemployment, disability and “substantially increased mortality” at the highest levels of gambling.While the findings do not prove that gambling causes those results, the research shows that higher spending on betting often goes hand in hand with negative outcomes. Longer-term monitoring also showed that gambling spend can escalate very quickly, but typically diminishes more slowly.They also offer no insight into the real-world impact of their spending, while the study from Oxford and Warwick researchers draws on actual transaction data to show whether gambling correlates with financial hardship.Peter Tutton, head of policy at the debt charity StepChange, said that while most clients identify other causes for their debts, “The financial effects of problem gambling do make people more vulnerable to problem debt. We hope the gambling sector and government will work hard ahead to break this link by ensuring proper protections are put in place.”The Labour MP Carolyn Harris, who leads a cross-party group of MPs examining gambling-related harm, said the study demonstrated the need for the government’s review to result in a much stricter gambling regime. “These findings are the most conclusive evidence yet of the gambling industry profiteering from the vulnerable and those in severe financial hardship,” she said. “The government needs to get a grip and properly regulate this toxic industry.”The industry’s lobby group, the Betting \u0026amp Gaming Council, said its members had recently introduced safety measures such as “enabling customers to self-exclude completely from gambling, closing tens of thousands of online accounts, encouraging the banks to enable customers to opt out of using their cards for betting transactions, as well as implementing the ban on the use of credit cards for betting”.The BGC had earlier released a report estimating that the number of people using black market betting sites had doubled since last year to £2.8bn. It warned that the problem could worsen if the UK cracks down too hard on regulated operators.An earlier version of the same research, carried out by accounting firm PwC on behalf of firms including William Hill and Ladbrokes owner Entain, was criticised as “exaggerated” by the Gambling Commission.Adam Wood, a 23-year-old from Sheffield who works in an optician, experienced first hand how increased gambling can lead to financial troubles. He had gambled on football a bit before he turned 18, but began to place bigger bets after getting into horse racing.“I gained quite a grasp of the sport and was picking winners. It was coming naturally to me,” he said. “That made me think I should bet more. “I went on a good streak, but when I started betting more, that streak came to an end. That was confusing to me because I was using the same methods and tactics. Instead of stopping, I just got more aggressive and upped the stakes, gambling on races I knew nothing about.“I was desperate to get back the money I’d lost and the situation got violently out of control. I had £7,000 of savings and blew that in a couple of weeks. I’d gamble my monthly wage of £1,500 within a few days.Soon, Adam began taking out payday loans with companies such as Wonga, Sunny and Satsuma. “The loans started off quite small, £200 or £300. The loans were my way of getting out of this mess and funding my expenses during the month but I’d gamble every single penny. I repeated it 13 or 14 times and the interest was phenomenally high.“My parents had to help me get the outstanding loans settled, about £7,000 or £8,000. They bailed me out, which I’m very grateful for, and I’m paying them back now.“My credit history is ruined for the next seven or eight years. I added up all of my accounts and I was down about £80,000 over four or five years. That’s a car, that’s a deposit on a house. It should have been mine for the future and it wasn’t.”Adam has now gone 10 months without placing a bet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c37d66f6ca12506bfb74707872c61ce9d77b9e98/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=74a628d2f995e80d74bd652c738b95bc","title":"no touchscreens more space welcome to the post pandemic office","story":"With new safety protocols prompting design changes, traditional office spaces may be a thing of the pastThe pandemic has shown us that work can go on without a workplace. If it can be done online, it can be done from virtually anywhere with an internet connection. At the same time, however, the move to remote work has revealed the value of the workplace, as many employees hanker to return to the office.In light of these two opposing trends, what might the office of the future actually look like?Elvira Muñoz Beraza, director of the master’s in strategic design of spaces at IE School of Architecture and Design, in Madrid, says that this year’s disruptions will transform offices for the better. “The pandemic has accelerated trends that were already there and has forced companies and experts to have difficult yet necessary conversations,” she says. “The office is the place for collaboration, social interaction and a sense of belonging. This implies less ‘me’ spaces and more ‘we’ spaces: the long open areas filled with inidual workstations or filled with cubicles are gone.”With inidual workstations effectively relocated to people’s kitchens and living rooms, offices are being reconfigured as places that primarily exist for teamwork and collaborative activity – albeit with strict social distancing measures in place and partitions separating different teams and departments.Architects and office planners are already busy with a raft of changes, including larger desks and layouts that make more use of stairwells to reduce the use of enclosed lifts. And, of course, there’s the ongoing drive to minimise the use of frequently touched surfaces, such as taps, door handles and buttons.Beraza is focused on how offices can evolve to meet the changing needs of a company and its employees. “I believe the design of the workplace will need to focus on a hybrid combination of physical and virtual, of inidual and collective, of internal and external actions, tasks and collaboration.”She notes the importance of supporting a hybrid form of office and remote work. “Remote working should stay, combined with physical encounters. Remote work is sustainable because it provides more choice and is more inclusive and erse. The nine-to-five office culture is gone for good.”Lewis Barker, ServiceNow’s senior manager of workplace services, EMEA, believes that, post-Covid, the distinction between “working from home” and “work” will cease to exist. “For many employees, the traditional office and desktop workspace is over. For them, work is wherever they want or need it to be, on whatever screen and digital device they prefer,” he says. “This agile, more distributed ‘anywhere, anytime’ workplace of the future will transform how companies operate.”Barker believes this flexibility will become an increasingly important factor for attracting and retaining staff. “If businesses don’t look to change, whether that’s with a hybrid model or all the way to completely remote, they will struggle to bring in the talent needed,” he says.Within the office, new technologies are being adopted to enable more rigorous safety protocols. Companies are shifting to touch-free sensor technology for handles, buttons and taps, signalling a reverse from the preponderance of pre-Covid touchscreens. Some planners are even looking at technology that will allow staff to control lifts and vending machines using their personal smartphones.“In terms of the conversations we’ve been having about safety precautions in the future,” says Barker, “it’s about trying to reduce the number of touchpoints employees have, whether that’s automatic doors, coffee machines, access card readers and things like that, to reduce any contamination generally.”Other design changes will need to take place, too. Daaf Serné, ServiceNow’s director of global real estate and workplace, suggests this will include allowing more square metres per person, as well as improving the amount of space in high traffic areas, and re-thinking how we can meet and collaborate in our offices. “One thing that will be key, is how technology will influence the physical environment. When thinking about the role that AI will play in the future workplace, it will help us predict when people are coming in and how we can optimisebetter utilise our spaces to support our employees better. When we talk about our ServiceNow products and how we would use this, reserving your seat or desk in the office will be ‘normal’,” he says.However work works right now, you can do it confidently with the ServiceNow Safe Workplace suite.

Here’s how to navigate the dos and don’tsWorkplace etiquette was a minor minefield before the pandemic. Now, in the wake of Covid-19, navigating an ever changing “new normal” of office interactions has become a major conundrum. Can you stop for a conversation in a one-way space? Should you get a colleague a cup of coffee? What can you do to make remote workers feel like fully integrated team members?There’s no pre-written rulebook for pandemic work etiquette, so let’s look at a few tips for navigating the new manners landscape.1. Keep your distanceIt’s amazing how quickly we’ve moved from an intimate, close-quarters society to one where people hug the sides of corridors upon passing another human. But good manners here are what they’ve always been. That is, you want other people to feel comfortable and at ease, so you should assume relatively strict distancing even if you are personally quite relaxed. If this seems a pain, there are some real upsides here. No more bone-crushing handshakes and no more awkward or clumsy collisions when a colleague or contact leans in for a peck on the cheek. You just waggle your elbows stupidly at each from a metre away from each other and make a joke about how weird it all is.2. Video conferencing v face-to-faceIf you are working on a hybrid or semi-remote team, there are unwritten rules of engagement. Those who are in the office can pick up on nuance and body language in a way that those who are on a video call just can’t. So it falls upon on-site employees to speak as if everyone is on a video call, taking turns and talking clearly. Resist the urge to make asides or get into rapid fire discussions with your in-person colleagues as this excludes those who are working remotely. It’s hard for remote employees to fully participate when it sounds as if they’ve called into the middle of a rugby scrum.4. If people are breaking the rules …A good rule of thumb here is to treat everyone as if they’re innocent at first. Rather than being aggressive or sarcastic you might say: “Mike, I think you forgot we’re meant to be socially distancing here.” Chances are a reminder is all it will take. However, if the person says it’s no big deal or refuses, you might say: “It makes me uncomfortable or anxious,” or “We all have to obey the rules, even if they’re a pain.” In the first case, you’re making it about their effect on you, not their behaviour and in the second, you’re making it about rules that aren’t set by either of you. Both or are non-confrontational and hard to argue with, especially the former.5. Companies can helpLewis Baker, senior workplace services manager at ServiceNow says that it really helps if companies codify the rules and explain them to staff. “We put together a Return to Workplace playbook, which explains the new workplace experience and behaviour we expect of ServiceNow employees upon return. By the time they came back in, they knew what the guidelines were.” He adds that ServiceNow also supplies some of the basics: “We provide masks. We also offer online mindfulness sessions, you know, cooking classes, nutrition advice, and ergonomic advice. We’ll help you to get set up from home and put support mechanisms in place.” Straightforward rules help people understand what is expected and reduces the risk of disagreement and conflict. Companies should also keep staff up to date as government guidelines and scientific advice changes.It truly is a weird new world of work out there. But by staying respectful and keeping it clean, we can all make it through together – apart.The ServiceNow Safe Workplace Suite offers tools for organisations to deliver the right digital experience for each phase of reopening.

It would then have to be manufactured in volume, he said.He added that an alternative approach might be to rely on the Valneva vaccine, currently in early trials, to act as “a booster in the autumn” because it uses a different technique thought to be more likely to be effective against mutations.The government’s joint committee on vaccination and immunisation has published a list of groups of people who will be prioritised to receive a vaccine for Covid-19 in the UK. The list is:1 All those 80 years of age and over and health and social care workers.2 All those 75 and over.3 All those 70 and over.4 All those 65 and over.5 Adults under 65 at high at risk of serious disease and mortality from Covid-19.6 Adults under 65 at moderate risk of at risk of serious disease and mortality from Covid-19.7 All those 60 and over.8 All those 55 and over.9 All those 50 and over.10 Rest of the population.The Valneva vaccine, however, would have to be approved by regulators and its effectiveness tested with people who have already had doses of other vaccines before it could be safely deployed.A further 378,794 people received first doses of a vaccine in England on Wednesday, plus 45,085 in Scotland and 28,073 in Wales, taking the total to 10.47m before figures for Northern Ireland were available.The UK passed 10m first dose vaccinations on Tuesday, two-thirds of the way to completing the first four priority groups in time for the target of mid-February.In earlier interviews, Zahawi said the government was creating a library of Covid-19 variants so it was better prepared to update vaccines as needed.Concerning variants have been identified in California, South Africa and Brazil, as well as the UK. Zahawi said: “There are about 4,000 variants around the world of Covid now.  All manufacturers including PfizerBioNTech, Moderna and OxfordAstraZeneca were looking at how they could improve their vaccines to be ready for any variant, he said.Zahawi brushed away a call from the shadow public health minister, Alex Norris, to have key workers vaccinated after the first four priority groups are completed alongside groups five to nine, which include those aged 50 to 70.A debate about how to prioritise key workers could come when phase two of the vaccination programme, covering adults in good health aged 18 to 49, was being considered, he added.When pushed on when all first nine groups in the priority list would have received a vaccine, Zahawi said earlier that people that could “do the maths”. At current rates, everyone in groups one to nine would be offered a first jab by early April.Asked whether it would take another 35 days from 15 February to have given first doses all 31 million people in the first nine cohorts, he replied: “That assumes the supply, so I don’t want to commit to a date without going through it with a very fine-tooth comb with the whole team, because our limiting factor is the supply of vaccines ultimately.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c5bfb87c301f47b2d6077e0d3ebf63fdb22e76f/0_104_1006_603/master/1006.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5bebb7f86b762ed48bdd8762fbaebc0","title":"black over 80s in england half as likely to have had covid vaccine","story":" Ministers criticised for failure to act as figures show huge racial disparity in vaccinationsMinisters have been criticised for failing to act more urgently on coronavirus vaccine disparities after data showed that white people are almost twice as likely to have been vaccinated as black people among over-80s in England.Black, Asian and mixed ethnicity people are all less likely to have been vaccinated than white people among those aged 80 and above in England, according to new research. A lower proportion of ethnic minorities have been shown to have received at least one vaccine dose up to 27 January.Equality campaigners have said calls to ministers 10 months ago to take urgent action to protect overexposed black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities were ignored, leading to the current vaccine uptake crisis.Halima Begum, chief executive of the Runnymede Trust, said she first raised concerns about the dangerous exposure of these communities in March last year. “This isn’t about vaccine refusal, because that very rhetoric implies that these communities are doing something wrong, it’s their fault somehow,” she said. “We need to balance the conversation away from hesitancy and uptake to the response to BAME groups and their institutional mistrust now, and how they might be supported to show trust back in our public services like the NHS and the police.” The trust says the government should prioritise the rollout of vaccines to BAME communities in dense urban areas “where the need is greatest” and work with community leaders to address misinformation and boost vaccine confidence.“That fear is often based on past experience, whether incidents of simple misunderstanding, cultural confusion or, in the case of some patients, an outright fear of perceived hostility and racism.”Experts and politicians have expressed growing concerns over vaccine scepticism within minority ethnic groups, prompting the government to launch a targeted publicity campaign to increase confidence. In January ministers pledged a fund worth more than £23m to try to quell the spread of misinformation about the vaccine and in the past few days politicians and celebrities have released videos to encourage people from BAME communities to get the jab.Last week, a report published in the Health Service Journal revealed a similar worrying trend among NHS workers, with fewer black and Filipino NHS staff vaccinated amid hesitancy concerns.Previous data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggested that black people had a fourfold higher risk of dying from Covid than white people, and that there were significant differences in mortality between ethnic groups and between the sexes.Terence Channer, an African-Caribbean solicitor who specialises in healthcare law, said he was deeply concerned by the statistics, but that some concerns of the black community were justifiable. “Racism in healthcare breeds distrust and in addressing vaccine hesitancy, racism in healthcare has to be tackled. The other issues are the theological or religious concerns that have to be addressed head on to engender black trust in vaccination,” he said. Channer urged the government to allow a black-led independent expert taskforce to have oversight of the vaccination process to raise black confidence levels. He also called for urgent research to be conducted on whether the black community would be less hesitant if black experts had oversight. “We have the expertise. I call on the government to have designated vaccination centres manned by black clinicians,” he said.Dr Priscilla Nkwenti, the chief executive of BHA for Equality, which challenges health inequalities in minority ethnic communities, said she had come across many examples of discrimination and poor practice in healthcare provision that could create and had created distrust.“There is a lack of meaningful involvement and engagement with BAME communities. We hope that any work targeting such communities should meaningfully engage them so as to win trust, allay fears and dispel myths and thus lead to increased uptake of health provision,” she said.When asked specifically whether the government was recording who was refusing to be vaccinated, Zahawi said: “We’ll absolutely look at how we are addressing the issues of refusal rates at the moment. This is the highest uptake of any vaccination programme, including all the flu vaccination programmes in the NHS so far. Currently, the good news is the UK is a standout country in terms of people wanting to keep themselves safe and vaccinated and keep their families and communities safe.” The data is based on 23.4m anonymised primary care patient records in England from OpenSafely. The study, by academics at the University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine, has yet to be peer-reviewed, and covers people, excluding care home residents, who received a dose of the vaccine up to 27 January.Additional reporting: Niko Kommenda and Aamna Mohdin"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebe7edc6d8ecdb2797335524f656a99466f7ac94/0_141_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac0ba66d202a9146cbb61120cb89427a","title":"covid vaccine refuse france germany us quarter","story":"Survey finds hesitancy related to trust in government, and more acute in younger peopleEmmanuel Rivière, Kantar’s director of international polling, said the study revealed the scale of the communications effort some governments will need to make if they hope to improve vaccine acceptance.“Vaccine hesitancy remains for large minorities in France, Germany and the US, where citizens can be twice or three times as likely to trust their family doctor as they are central government,” Rivière said. “This will clearly need to be reflected in governments’ campaigns.”The popularity of national governments in Europe was unlikely to be affected by the slow pace of vaccination programmes as long as Covid-19 restrictions were in place across the continent, he said. “But if countries that have vaccinated fast start returning to normal sooner, governments could pay a price,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Young people seeking to unblock barriers to participation and engagement on climatePush for environmental regulations has alienated voters in the American MidwestNew appointments to Climate Change Advisory Council coinciding with enhanced role"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Government and its agencies finally taking threats of storms seriously"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4476514.1612470716!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"holohan has huge amount of regret over cervicalcheck issues","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Tony Holohan, chief medical officer, Department of Health, said a lot of work had been done  so that lessons could be learned from the experience of women who had been harmed and who had ‘reasonable questions’. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsChief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan says he has “a huge amount of regret” over the harm done to women in the CervicalCheck controversy.He specified the harm involved as being the failure to disclose to the women the findings of retrospective clinical audits of their cases carried out by the screening programme.Dr Holohan was asked about the CervicalCheck issue at the regular National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) briefing on Thursday. This followed the settlement reached this week by Lynsey Bennett, a 32-year-old mother of two who is seriously ill with cervical cancer, of her High Court action over the alleged misinterpretation of her slides.He said a lot of work had been done to find mechanisms that are patient- and women-centred so that lessons could be learned from the experience of women who had been harmed and who had “reasonable questions”.Asked if he would apologise to Ms Bennett, Dr Holohan said he did not know the details of the case.He said he was aware that a letter from the clinical director of the programme had been read out in court, which had addressed the issue.In spring 2018, major controversy erupted when it emerged that hundreds of women had not been told the outcome of a review of their slides carried out by CervicalCheck.This emerged following a court settlement in a case taken by Vicky Phelan over the reading of her smears. A succession of court cases taken by seriously ill women has followed since, despite efforts to set up a tribunal where they would be heard in private.Asked if he would apologise to other women affected by the controversy, Dr Holohan said the State and the Taoiseach had apologised for the “significant harm” done through non-disclosure of clinical audits.The issues involved had been investigated in great detail in two investigations, but no findings of “adverse functioning” had been made against the programme.He described the failure to deliver on commitments to share information with women was a “substantial wrong”.Pressed further to apologise, he said: “I have a huge amount of regret at to what happened to women in those situations”.Dr Holohan said Ireland was one of only a few countries that introduced retrospective audits for cervical cancer screening.He said CervicalCheck shared this information with its clinicians “but the clinicians did not share it with the inidual women”.Only through the investigations of the Department of Health after Ms Phelan’s case was it learned that of 200 cases, three-quarters of the women were not given the audit information, he said.Stressing that he had “huge sympathy” for the women affected, he said this “shouldn’t have happened”. The non-disclosure of information did not impact on their clinical care, he added.Legal casesMeanwhile, the Tánaiste told the Dáil the State Claims Agency should settle CervicalCheck cases “quickly, sensitively and in a humane way” where negligence was not disputed.Leo Varadkar said he had made this point previously at meetings with the agency, which handles legal cases against the State.He added: “I am sure we can emphasise and reiterate this point again”.Mr Varadkar was responding to Labour Party leader Alan Kelly who challenged him about the case of Ms Bennett who is seriously ill with cervical cancer.“Why is she being dragged through the High Court when she should be spending time with her daughters,” he asked.“Why three years after you told us that women would not have to go through the courts are there 200 more cases in the courts?”The Tipperary TD added: “Is the State Claims Agency waiting for women to die?”He said it would be cheaper for the State because of the law where next of kin pursuing cases will not get the same amount of award and he called on the Tánaiste to urge the agency to deal with cases quickly and humanely.Mr Varadkar said he wished Ms Bennett’s case could have been settled sooner.“Can the State Claims Agency be directed to handle cases in a humane way where negligence is not disputed? Yes, and I have done so.”He said, however, that delays would occur where the facts were disputed.The Tánaiste pointed to the CervicalCheck tribunal and said it would allow for “quicker and better outcomes for the women affected”.Mr Kelly said the Tánaiste promised three years ago that women would not have to go through the courts but there were about 200 cases lined up in the High Court.Mr Varadkar said problems arose where doctors and scientists say they did not misread a smear test “and they are also entitled to have their side of the story heard. We do not want that to happen in courts”.That was why the CervicalCheck tribunal was established, he said. “It will allow cases to be fast-tracked.“It will allow them to be heard in a more sensitive way and, hopefully, it will produce quicker and better outcomes for the women concerned.”"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4476111.1612444768!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"vaccination for over 70s may well be slower says t%C3%A1naiste","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeo Varadkar: vaccination programme for those over 85 will start in the middle of this month with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccineThe recommendation that the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccination should not be used for those over 70 “will probably change”, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said in the Dáil.But he confirmed the vaccination programme for those over 85 will start in the middle of this month with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine following the recommendation of the public health authorities.The rollout for those over 70 “may well be slower” than originally planned he said but added that for healthcare workers and other groups it would go faster.Mr Varadkar said the same number of vaccines as intended would still be given.Public health and scientific advisers have recommended people over 70 should be given the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine rather than the AstraZeneca vaccine because of the lack of data on that age group.“I should say that all three vaccines are safe. They are effective, particularly in terms of reducing hospitalisations and deaths. And they have been licensed for all age groups,” Mr Varadkar said.“However, because of the lack of detail and the relatively small number of older people involved in the AstraZeneca study, at least for now – and this will probably change – the recommendation is to give the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s, where possible.”Mr Varadkar was responding to Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty who said there were serious challenges facing GPs to provide the vaccine to older people.The Tánaiste told him the only constraint was on the supply of vaccines and that GPs would still be involved in the rollout of the vaccine.There would be logistical challenges because some GP surgeries would not have the capacity to vaccinate in their clinics because of the temperature requirements for the vaccine, the Tánaiste said, adding vaccination centres might have to be used.“We will have to adapt our plans as things develop, as supplies come in, as science changes, as recommendations change,” he said.“But it still means that 1.2 million doses at least will be delivered, and given to people by the end of March.”Mr Varadkar said pharmacies are part of the second cohort to be vaccinated. “They’re considered to be healthcare workers who are patient-facing, and they will be vaccinated.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4385961!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"world view who is alexei navalny","story":"The \u0027 unrivalled foreign affairs coverage, now brought to you in weekly podcast form.

It said it was possible it could sell them everywhere in the future.A spokesman said: “The trend for people trying Little Moons mochi on TikTok has had a hugely positive impact on sales and we\u0027ve upped our orders to cope with demand.“Lockdown has seen customers both treating themselves and exploring new foods from the comfort of their own home  - this Japanese ice cream is the perfect combination of those things.”The passion fruit flavour is currently the third best-selling luxury ice cream at Waitrose.Tesco said it sold 588 per cent more Little Moons products last week than in the first week of December 2020.Tesco said they are available in 184 stores across the UK and it is working to bring in more stock.Little Moons have mochi dough wrapped around ice cream and come frozen.

He’s going to have to do better. The question being asked by his supporters and detractors is: can he?There is a difference between a lie and an inadvertent false statement. As a nervous minister at my very first oral questions in 2006, I became flustered and wrongly stated that the new East Coast Mainline franchise was worth £2.1 billion to the Department for Transport. It wasn’t the correct figure was £1.2 billion. But no one accused me of lying.At Prime Minister’s Questions in the Commons yesterday, Starmer also was guilty of the latter, not the former. He made a mistake, probably because he had over-rehearsed the answer he planned to give when Boris Johnson posed the much-anticipated question.  Except that the prime minister didn’t ask the expected question but an important variation of it. Instead of accusing Starmer personally of supporting Britain’s involvement in the EU’s Covid vaccine approval process, he accused the Labour leader – correctly – of having supported Britain’s continued membership of the European Medicines Agency, which happens to have responsibility for approval of vaccines.Starmer ploughed ahead with his rehearsed answer anyway and denied Johnson’s accusation. Had he listened more intently – shall we say, forensically? – he may have been able to avoid the bear trap set by Johnson. Instead he had to issue a humiliating apology afterwards. And the difference between one thing and the other, between membership of the EMA and support for Britain’s participation in the Covid vaccine approval process, was by then lost on a viewing public bored with the finer details. It was an emphatic win for Johnson and a day that will be preferred to be forgotten by Starmer and his office.One poor PMQs performance doesn’t write a leader’s obituary. Even Tony Blair had his off days across the despatch box from then prime minister John Major: remember when Blair was humiliated by Major over the Labour leader’s and Harriet Harman’s decision not to send their children to state comprehensives? Blair recovered his esteem in voters’ eyes and his mojo, and the rest is history. Can Starmer do the same?Yes, he can, but that doesn’t mean he will. Never in Labour’s history has a new leader been burdened with such a level of expectation and, at the same time, such a large number of detractors in his own party. That is a consequence of the last six years of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, the sense of betrayal still felt by the former leader’s fans and the changes that Starmer has wrought since taking over. All Labour leaders have had their critics but Starmer has repeatedly poked the nest of vipers at a time when the viper population is still at a historically high level.He will not be challenged for the leadership, nor will he resign voluntarily. Starmer will lead his party into the next general election. There is no appetite whatever for a new contest and Starmer would easily win any vote of confidence among his own MPs, were one to be held (which it won’t be). Which makes the constant sniping on social media from members who will never be reconciled to Corbyn’s departure all the more damaging. The problem for Labour is that some of that sniping has some justification.Yesterday was a low point but low points are most damaging when they merely confirm suspicions among some that a particular inidual isn’t up to the job, that he was always going to fall on his face and it might as well be now as later. Again, this is probably unfair. Starmer will be as tough on himself after his PMQs disaster as anyone else could be, and he won’t repeat this particular mistake. Still, the nagging doubt in many minds that Starmer has not been the inspiring, exciting figure the party needs right now will have been dangerously reinforced by yesterday’s events.As I have written here more than once, the opportunity for a new leader to define himself to his audience is a relatively narrow window. Voters tend to make up their minds about politicians within a very short period of their arriving on the national scene. By the time Blair had his little mishap at the dispatch box over parental choice on schools, he had already established his reputation as a prime minister in waiting. Starmer is in not such an enviable position. While his window of opportunity may be slightly extended until after the Covid emergency has passed, he is nevertheless running out of time, as all leaders do. When the music stops, he must sit on whichever chair is available and accept the judgment of the people. If that were to happen today, the verdict would be that Starmer is a good, decent, sensible chap who used to be a lawyer. That’s all very well, and an improvement on his predecessor, but it won’t be enough to propel him and his party into Downing Street. So he needs more time to define himself, he needs to keep winding up that gramophone handle to keep the music playing just a little bit longer. And he needs to hope that the voters won’t get bored of him while they’re waiting.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inside uks biggest food charity","story":"AdvertorialInside the UKs biggest food charity - which is keeping families fed across BritainBarclays has pledged support to the food redistribution charity FareShare as part of its £m COVID- Community Aid PackagemirrorShareByJemma PattonWilliam Ramsey:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB AdvertorialFareShare is the UK’s largest food redistribution charity One in five children in the UK are currently growing up in a household where food is scarce, and one in four parents skip meals due to lack of money.These stats are no surprise to Kylie Brackstone, Playground Manager at Somerstown Adventure Playground in Portsmouth, which is part of Portsmouth City Council’s Play Youth and Community Service . Before the Coronavirus lockdowns the playground had been feeding children and parents daily. “We’d always have the slow cooker going, especially in the winter, always a stew or a soup, remembers Kylie.Our approach is always very informal, easy access, the children and their parents would know they could help themselves whenever they liked. People then felt secure enough to kind of say ‘I’m struggling this month’ and we could put a little box together for them.”  Although PYC’s kitchens have had to close during lockdowns, they’ve been providing food parcels to families across Portsmouth.Holly Easlick, Health Development Officer for the council, tells us how FareShare – the UK’s largest food redistribution charity – helped: “During the first lockdown FareShare were able to deliver us more food than ever so we were able to get it out to the families who needed it. Kylie stresses how vital this contact with vulnerable families is: “With Covid-, the food was a big thing to help us continue our interaction with the families. Families that struggle with food provision, there are people truly in need.” She adds: “Itaposs also about that weekly interaction. A lot of our families struggle with mental health, so that idea that they knew they could come down every week and get a food package, and also see us, talk to us was one of the most important things.Even though it was just kind of over the gate, we were able to have a conversation and it was a way in to seethere were other ways they were struggling and we could support them.”  FareShare is a network of  independent organisations with more than  warehouses right across the UK. The charity takes food that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors, short shelf le or over production, and redistribute it through a network of , frontline organisations.The food FareShare redistributes is nourishing and fresh – the same as the food you’d eat at home. Homeless hostels, school breakfast clubs, domestic violence refuges, older people’s lunch clubs, food banks and hospices all depend on FareShare’s help. Ninety per cent of these charities have seen demand reach crisis levels since the pandemic started, and they’re preparing for even more people to find themselves in need this winter. Over the coming months, FareShare will also be delivering food to night shelters and school holiday projects to reach even more people who are struggling. This winter Barclays is working with FareShare to help raise vital funds. With approximately .m people in the UK currently living in food poverty, the amount of food that’s currently wasted is shocking. It’s estimated that a third of all food produced is wasted, at a cost of £b.  FareShare is committed to ensuring that food that would otherwise be wasted gets redistributed with frontline charities and community groups. Barclaysapos £m Covid- Community Aid Package was established to help charities continue to carry out the vital work they do. It’s pledging support to organisations that are helping people affected by the crisis. To support this peak in winter demand, Barclays is pledging to donate £ for every £ you donate to FareShare through the link or text number below, up to £m, until  February. FareShare is able to provide up to four meals with every £ donated – with Barclays your £ means up to  meals for those in need.So to help feed someone this winter, contribute via Barclays by going to fareshare.org.uk barclays or texting GIVE , GIVE  or GIVE  to .

But so far, the vaccine programme seems to be keeping up with manyof the expectations that were set for it. More than million people in the UK have been given a first dose, with ministers claiming they are on track to meet a target of offering a dose to the million most vulnerable by February . Of course, itaposs hard to know exactly when weaposve met this target. The NHS doesnapost publish figures on how many people are offered a jab - only how many have been given it. And there is still no full breakdown of the number of jabs per vulnerable group. But one target we can be pretty sure has been hit is the goal to open  mass vaccination sites in England by the end of January. By the end of last week the number had hit  exactly, at least according to a spreadsheet circulated by NHS England. This week the total has increased by , bringing the total to . The total includes stadiums, conference centres and hospitals - itaposs not clearthe hospitals were already vaccination sites before this week.  Mass vaccination centres are only one part of the rollout, and for many elderly people theyaposre inconvenient to get to. There are also still gaps and lumps in supply, with some local areas far ahead of others.

Secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said Donald Trumpaposs White House successor offered a “unique” opportunity to reform the -year-old group. Former Norwegian Prime Minister Mr Stoltenberg told the Chatham House foreign affairs think tank: “The new Biden administration provides a unique opportunity to re-energise, to revitalise, to rebuild NATO.” Mr Biden, , was Barack Obamaaposs vice-president for eight years and previously played a leading foreign affairs role on Capitol Hill. His predecessor as US President, Mr Trump, refused to commit to NATOaposs Article V principle of mutual self-defence – that an attack on one member nation was an assault on all.  And he caused chaos at the  summit in Brussels with an unprecedented rant at allies over defence spending. But he was eventually praised for forcing European countries to pump more money into their Armed Forces after signalling he could pull the US out of the alliance unless other members stumped up more cash. NATO leaders expect more stability from the White House under its news Premier. Mr Stoltenberg said: “I have spoken with President Biden twice since his election and he has expressed strongly his personal commitment to NATO.  “I have worked with him in his previous capacities and I know that President Biden is a strong personal supporter of the transatlantic bond and he knows NATO very well.” Highlighting how the alliance is still vital more than seven decades after it was formed, Mr Stoltenberg said “peace has been preserved and freedom maintained” since its creation in . But stressing the “world has changed and become much more unpredictable than when I was growing up”, Mr Stoltenberg said  Century threats were “blurred”.

But thereaposs good news on the horizon, with more than million people now given a first dose of Covid vaccine - and early signs the Oxford jab reduces transmission of the virus by % - and Chris Whitty saying on February  we are apospast the peakapos. Thataposs prompted calls for Boris Johnson to bring forward his plan to ease lockdown, which begins on March  by opening schools. As Scotland announced schools would likely reopen from February , Tory MPs on the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group warned England must have a very good reason not to do the same. But with case rates higher in England than Scotland, and deaths still higher than , a day, the PM is so far sticking firmly to his plan. He says heaposll bring forward a lockdown easing plan in the week of February , with no changes before March . What is your view  Have your say in the comments section below Reports - denied as b*****ks by his allies - suggest Chancellor Rishi Sunak is pushing for measures to ease as soon as deaths are down, believing there may soon be a fat lady sings moment when cases stay high but deaths plunge due to vaccine immunity kicking in. But with more easily transmissible mutant strains emerging in the UK, and the nation passing the grim milestone of , deaths, scientic advisors are urging caution. The government has also failed to introduce forced quarantine in hotels for Brits ing from  aposred listapos countries where there are new iants. It was promised at the end of January but may only launch on February . The vaccine will be key. Even though care home residents have now been offered the jab, Care Minister Helen Whately has suggested normal visits may only resume once most have had their second dose in April. Meanwhile, Englandaposs Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty has said itaposll only be after all over-s have got the jab that pressure on the NHS will signicantly reduce. The original plan was to get all over-s their first dose by the end of April. But in a glimmer of hope, privately Whitehall sources believe that could happen quicker. Some murmurings even claim every UK adult could be offered both doses by the end of August. So with all these iables at play, what might the lockdown exit roadmap look like  And how will the next few months go down  Hereaposs everything we know - or can guess - so far. January  Tory ministers claimed they had met their target to offer a first dose of the vaccine to all residents in Englandaposs care homes. However, more than  care homes had not yet been fully reached because they had an active outbreak. There was also confusion about how many staff had had a jab and the government refused to provide firm figures. A minister said staff were still being worked through, only for another minister to claim the staff target had been met. Despite the vaccine breakthrough, normal care home visits are not expected to resume for months. Except for exceptions like deathbed visits, they have to be conducted outdoors or through pods or screens. February  This is the date of the review of the third lockdown in England, as set by the Prime Minister at the start of January. By this date the Government should have a clearer picture of whether the lockdown has worked. Plans will be brought forward the following week. Importantly, this is also the deadline for offering the first dose of a vaccine to all million of the most vulnerable people in the UK.  They are all over-s all elderly care home residents and their carers all shielders and frontline NHS and social care staff. After this, officials will move on to administering first doses to the next priority groups - all over-s and younger “at risk” groups. Separately, around this time the government’s advisors are meant to rule on how priority will work for the final phase of the vaccine rollout - in other words, whether teachers, shop workers and police will get it first. Finally, February  is the rumoured date when hotel quarantine will finally come into force. It was announced three weeks earlier. Brits ing from  aposred listapos countries, where travel for non-Brits is already banned, will have to be in guarded hotels for  days. February   Boris Johnson said the lockdown exit roadmap will be published in the week of February . It will go before Parliament for debate. Reports - downplayed by No - have claimed the roadmap will set out three stages of lting lockdown from March . Mr Johnson and Englandaposs Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty have confirmed lockdown will not be lted all at once - but will instead involve a number of stages. However, the Prime Minister has indicated England will notto the regional apostieredapos system and instead ease out of lockdown all at once - contrary to what he said before. The first actual easing of restrictions isnapost expected until March - despite Scotland potentially opening schools from February . February  It appears this is when the lockdown roadmap will be debated in Parliament. The government has announced the Commons will debate a proposal for a national education routemap for schools and colleges in response to the Covid- outbreak. March   This is the earliest date schools could reopen in England, according to Mr Johnson. He said the roadmap will give two weeksapos notice to parents, pupils and school staff. It has been reported some year groups may go back first - most likely primary schools and those in secondaries that have exams this year. Only after this will non-essential shops, pubs and the like start to reopen, but advisers have said we need a clear two-week break between each new thing opening to check itaposs going okay. The reason for the delay from February  is that it takes three weeks for immunity to have some effect. March Schools will be the first to reopen, but quickly other minor aspects of lockdown could be lted - such as the ban on mixing with others from outside your home. We might see a reinstatement of the rule of six, allowing you to meet up with five others, for example. That will set out whether you can meet with people in your garden, in public, in your home or where and how many people at once. March  This is the date the current lockdown legislation for England ends. MPs will have to approve any extension to lockdown rules after this date. By this point, the process of giving first doses to people aged  to  and younger ‘at risk’ groups is meant to be well under way. Officially the target to offer these million people their first dose is the end of April, but sources have claimed it could go quicker. A government source told the Mirror it is possible all million will be offered their first dose by the middle or end of March.  There are a couple of things that could scupper the timetable at this point. Firstly, this is around the time when the NHS has to start giving hundreds of thousands of people per day their second dose. That could gum up capacity and make it harder to get new people through the door for first doses. However, ministers believe the vaccine supply is secure to this point. Vaccine Minister Nadhim Zahawi said on February : “Our limitation is the vaccine supply. It remains stable and good. I can see week by week supply all the way through to the end of March, which is good news.” April  Easter Sunday - and a time when Boris Johnson claimed restrictions would be substantially lted. “I think we can certainly look forward to a very, very dferent world in this country, from Easter onwards,” the PM said. This date is gaining traction because ministers and Chris Whitty have suggested that, after over-s get the jab, itaposll be safe to lt many restrictions. This is around the time many over-sapos immunity should begin kicking in. But the PM has repeatedly over-promised on this in the past. If restrictions aren’t lted in a big way by this point, you could expect a battle between Tory lockdown sceptics and the PM. UK Hospitality has called for pubs to reopen from this weekendcase rates are falling, but others say itaposs far too soon. April  According to The , the Governmentaposs roadmap will make sure there is not a sudden increase in community transmission, by staggering what opens when. A Whitehall source told the : If schools do open in March, and the priority is certainly to open schools first, then it will mean other things have to remain closed for some time. “We have to avoid the situation last time where theof schools meant far greater household mixing across the board. “So that means weaposd be likely to wait at least another month for non-essential retail, and a month beyond that at least for pubs and restaurants. That would mean early April is likely when non-essential retail, such as clothes and electronics shops, could reopen, possibly coinciding with Easter.  The Government could also use this Easter break to kickstart tourism, allowing for the reopening of some tourist attractions and possibly accommodation. Travel rules could be eased - within the UK - to allow for staycations. Previously Boris Johnson claimed restrictions would be substantially lted by Easter “I think we can certainly look forward to a very, very dferent world in this country, from Easter onwards,” the PM said. April  This is a back-of-a-cigarette-packet figure being touted by some as when lockdown could start properly easing. Itaposs come about because experts say lockdown measures can only lt in a big way once first doses are offered to all over-s. Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi refused to say when that would happen - and the official target date is April . But some have calculated that,the government continues at its current required rate of million first doses every  days, all over-s and vulnerable groups would be all offered a first dose by around March . It takes around three weeks for immunity to take effect, which supposedly takes us to April . This is not a reliable figure, though. Firstly it relies on there being no lumps or gaps in supply. Secondly it misses out the rather massive fact that, from March, weaposll be giving millions of people second doses at the same time. Englandaposs Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said: From March, weaposll be starting to re-vaccinate as well as the first vaccines, and that will inevitably slow things down. April  This is the latest date by which all over-s and at-risk groups are meant to have been offered their first dose, according to the NHS. m people should have been offered a first vaccine dose by this date. Millions more will be getting their second dose at the same time. After that, the NHS will move onto giving first doses to the final, lowest-priority group - all adults under  without major health issues. These m people will be sorted into priority groups and it’s thought teachers and other key workers will be put first. Meanwhile, care home visits may only properly resume around this date. Care home residents were offered a first dose by the end of January - but it takes  weeks to get a second dose. And care minister Helen Whately said: I know relatives are desperate for normal visiting and I am determined that happen as soon as it is safe, but most care home residents must have their second dose. May  Under theplan, early April could be the earliest that pubs, restaurants and other hospitality businesses would be allowed to reopen. The date could coincide with the May Bank Holiday, usually a big money date for pubs and tourism businesses. SAGE experts have previously said May would be a safer date for reopening the hospitality sector -infection rates can be brought down. If all the over s and most vulnerable have had their first vaccine dose by April, then May would be seen as substantially safe for easing lockdown further. May will also see elections across the country, meaning the Government will want to have eased restrictionspossible to allow this to happen. Mark Harper, chairman of the Covid Recovery Groupof lockdown-sceptic Tories, said he thought the Government could get rid of restrictions completely by the end of May. Asked on BBC Radio aposs World At One: Back-of-the-envelope calculations that I did based on two million doses a week, you could get the top nine groups, first doses, and the top four groups, second doses, all done by the end of May. So it seems to me by the time you get to the end of May, no later than that, you should be in a position to get rid of restrictions completely. But obviously it does depend on the rollout of the vaccine. July Second doses should be rounded off for the middle priority group, the over-s. It’s also one predicted date for all adults to finish being offered their first dose. Officially the target is September for this, but government sources told the Sundayit could be as soon as July. If all adults have had a vaccine by this date, then summer travel becomes more of a possibility. There will still be a aposred listapos of countries requiring quarantine and the Foreign Office will have a list of countries people shouldnapost travel to at all.  Foreign holidays will depend as much on the rules of other countries as of the UK Government - which will be determined by how much of their population has been vaccinated and how safe they view the UK to be. Spain appeared to say it could be closed to tourists throughout the summer season - although it later rolled back on that. July  Rules allowing councils to close pubs, restaurants, shops and parks expire on this date - so it is the current latest date we could see ongoing closures in England. August Tentative reports suggest officials are hopeful that, by the end of August, all adults in the UK will have had both doses of the vaccine. This would allow a major reopening of society. But officially the target is only to offer all adults a first dose by September. Chris Whitty said August is at the very optimistic end. Scientists are hopeful though. SAGE member Andrew Hayward said: I think what weaposll see is a phased opening up as the vaccination levels increase, and then we will be more or less back to normal for the summer, I would imagine. September The Government aims to have offered a first dose of the vaccine to every adult by September. Tory ministers have pledged all UK adults will be offered their first dose by this month. Dominic Raab said the target was by September”, telling Sky News: If we can do it faster than that, great, but thataposs the roadmap. September  The start of autumn. Professor Chris Whitty said some coronavirus restrictions could be in place until the autumn while the NHS Chief Executive Sir Simon Stevens said restrictions would be lted between the spring and summer - with summer ending on this date. October The start of flu season, and mass vaccination against that disease. This may be combined with the re-vaccination of the most vulnerable against coronavirus at the end of . Scientists are unsure how long immunity will last from having the jab - with estimates of anything from five to nine months. That means those currently getting the jab will likely need to have another one in October to protect them through next winter. AstraZeneca and Oxford have said vaccine booster shots against new coronavirus iants should be ready by this month. We just have to hope a new iant hasnapost taken hold by that point. December  Even once all UK adults are given a first dose, second doses could go on until Christmas due to a -week gap. That would mean maximum protection would only be given to the maximum size of population about a year from now. Even after this is complete, there are many questions about where the UK’s Covid response goes from here. The vaccine will not eliminate coronavirus completely, and new iants could emerge that challenge how effective it is. That suggests travel restrictions could continue to exist into winter , as well as some of the less invasive restrictions we’ve got used to. Scientic advisors have suggested this could include, for example, wearing masks on public transport.

SAGE’s Andrew Hayward said the inoculation programme offered a key to easing the lockdown. Figures tonight showed ,, people have received first doses. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “Today we passed the threshold of one in five of the population who have been jabbed already.” The UK remains on track to complete jabs of the top four priority groups by February , he added.What is your view  Have your say in the comments sectionCoronavirus cases continued to fall, with , recorded – down % on a rolling seven-day average. And , Covid- patients were admitted to hospital, down %.The UK death toll rose by , down %, to ,. Prof Hayward, professor of ­infectious disease epidemiology and inclusion health research at University College London, believed the increase in vaccinations will plot a path out of the shutdown. He said: “Once the most ­vulnerable people, particularly those over- and those with chronic illnesses, are ­vaccinated then yes, I think we can see a signicantto normality. “I think what we’ll see is a phased opening up as vaccination levels increase. Then we’ll be more or less back to normal for the summer, I would imagine.”  Pressure is mounting on Boris Johnson to publish a lockdown exit plan. The PM has vowed to outline a strategy in the week beginning February .Schools will reopen first, with face-to-face lessons in England due to resume from March . Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the rate of the fall in cases fuelled hopes curbs on households’ mixing could go next month – with pupils back before March . He said: “I think there could well be a case for opening schools sooner – I particularly think schools for children under  years of age, where the evidence that they contribute to the spread of the epidemic in the wider population is a lot lower.” Prof Hunter thought diners couldto restaurants “probably around the same time [March], maybe April”.It comes amid claims Rishi Sunak told allies Britain was approaching a “fat lady sings moment” for the easing of curbs. An “ally” of Mr Sunak quoted by the Daily ­ said: “Rishi remains where he has been throughout the pandemic – he is pro-opening as quickly and as safely as possible. This needs to be the last time that we do this.” Labour said the reported claims, less than a month before the Budget, were “so ­irresponsible”.Shadow Public Health Minister Alex Norris said Mr Sunak’s ­“disastrous ­decision to block public health ­measures [last year] helped give Britain the worst death toll in Europe and the worst recession of any major economy”. Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson tweeted: “You can’t protect the economy during a pandemic unless you protect public health.” However, a source close to the Chancellor said they were ­“absolutely not things he would say”.  Tory MP Mark Harper, chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of lockdown-sceptic Conservatives, claimed curbs could be lted by the end of May. He said: “Back-of-the-envelope calculations based on two million doses a week, you could get the top nine groups first doses, and top four groups second doses, all done by the end of May.” Mr Johnson’s spokesman said: “It remains the PM’s view we want to start easing lockdown restrictions and we are keen to do that from March .” NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson warned services were still at “full stretch” and cautioned against relaxing measures too early, adding “the NHS has barely crested the peak”. Prof Helen Rees, of the World Health Organisation’s emergency committee for Covid, believed masks and social distancing will have to continue.

Charity West London Welcomehas shared pictures of the aposairline-likeapos meals provided to people living in emergency hotel accommodation. One appalling dinner included mash, peas and a bag of crisps while another consisted of congealed noodles. The charity claims families awaiting decisions on their asylum for months arenapost even allowed to use microwaves to heat food up and have to resort to boiling eggs in kettles. The Home Office has given a number of its contracts to manage temporary hotels housing asylum-seekers to the same firm running the Napier Barracks in Folkestone, Kent, that has been hit by a fire and a Covid- outbreak. Clearsprings Ready Homes was given a budget of £ per person for three meals a day, WLW claims, with the charity comparing the food to the free school meals scandal.A Labour MP has branded the food degrading and has written to Home Secretary Priti Patel in protest at the callous treatment.A Home Office spokesperson said asylum seekers are provided with a choice of three meals a day in line with NHS nutrition guidelines.What do you think  Share your views in the comments below... Asylum-seekers are legally barred from finding work or accessing benefits, which could allow them make their own food in the hotels. But they have also been banned from using the hotelsapos kitchens, including microwaves, and were forced to toss out donated ready-meals they could not cook, charityaposs director Joanne MacInnes told the Mirror. Pictures of the unimpressive meals shared by the charity include a stew covered in sweetcorn that was given to a seven-year-old for lunch. Another picture of a packaged chicken burger was criticised for its ‘astonishing’ list of highly-processed ingredients.One tweet showing picture of a packaged dinner roll said: The adult’s meal is a cold patty that they’re unable to heat up given that they have no access to any cooking facilities whatsoever. “Imagine never being able to warm up your food ” Ms MacInnes claimed asylum-seekers in London hotels her charity was helping were left boiling donated eggs and pot noodles in their roomsapos kettles. Clearsprings has had a Home Office contract to run accommodation services across London, Englandaposs South and the Wales regions since . The charity has been fielding complaints from asylum-seekers around the capital - some of whom have lived in the hotels since last June. Their allegations include being given half-heated chicken they are afraid to eat in case of food poisoning.  The charity says a number of asylum-seekers have shown them doctoraposs notes saying the food is making them sick due to a lack of nutrition, also alleging they were only given only three pieces of fruit a week per person and never any salad. Asylum-seekers able to find a way into independent accommodation are given £ a week for living costs by the Home Office but those in the temporary accommodation are given just £ a week, the charity said. WLW is calling for the hotel food supplies to be overhauled, and for the employment ban and aposno recourse to public fundsapos policies to be scrapped for asylum-seekers. Ms MacInnes said people fleeing war and persecution deserved a better welcome to Britain. “These are some of the most vulnerable people in society who arrive here with trauma and PTSD, she said. The meals they were being served were not nutritious and left people hungry, she added.  “There’s never been salad, there’s never been anything fresh or crunchy. We’ve not seen that in a single meal, she said. They average around three pieces of fruit a week - always bananas or oranges - that’s the only fresh food they are given.The point is people have been in these hotels for up to eight months and this is what they are eating.”Clearsprings has been criticised recently over conditions at Napier Barracks, which was hit by a mass Covid- outbreak last month. A fire at the facility last week followed protests by asylum-seekers at the conditions there. The incident led Ms Patel to accuse asylum-seekers of setting the fire, in a statement claiming the aposshocking scenesapos showed they were aposnot grateful aposfor British taxpayersapos hospitality. Hammersmith Labour MP Andy Slaughter has written to the Home Secretary, demanding an explanation and branding the meals pictured by the charity appalling and degrading.  He sought answers on costs and urged urgent checks to the nutritional quality of the disgraceful food being served. Mr Slaughter said: “They can’t rely on takeaways as they don’t have any means… it’s clearly an issuethey are being given food that needs to be heated up and they’re not allowed to do that. It’s an expression of the callousness of this government.” He accused the Home Secretary of permitting poor conditions as part of the Tories’ ‘hostile environment’ policy. Mr Slaughter said: “It’s asthere are people in the Home Office deciding new ways to be nasty to asylum-seekers, as a part of Patel’s strategy to put a stop people from coming here to claim asylum.” "},{"url":null,"title":"butlins barmaid 22 pulled sea","story":"NewsButlins barmaid, , pulled into sea by wave and drowned after argument with boyfriendTragic Bethany Skinner, , was pulled from the water in Bognor Regis, West Sussex, last February, and tragically died in hospital two days later, an inquest heardmirrorShareByAdela Whittingham:,  FEB NewsBethany Skinner had been due to move to China to teach English before she died \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbizWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The report states: “The highly transmissible nature of the circulating mutant virus and the inability to isolate patients in single rooms combined with infections in staff and asymptomatic carriage resulted in high numbers of nosocomial [acquired in hospital] infections.”Have you been affected by coronavirus  Let us know in the comments  It also emerged that “a number” of patients fell ill with Covid despite being “medically fit” for discharge. The report added: “A signicant additional factor was theof stay for many patients who were medically fit for discharge but were unable toto their place of residence.” Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is in charge of Bedford Hospital and Luton and Dunstable University Hospital.  Capt Sir Tom was admitted to Bedford Hospital on January  and diagnosed with pneumonia. He was discharged on January  but tested positive for coronavirus the same day. By January  he had been ed to the same hospital to receive treatment to help him breathe.  Capt Sir Tom, who raised over £ million for the NHS, passed away aged  on Tuesday.

On January ,  per cent of adult beds at Bedford Hospital were occupied by Covid- patients. The report adds: “A signicant proportion of cases in the second surge were detected + days following admission, indicating infection was due to acquisition in the hospital.”  It emerged that between October and December last year there were “six incidents of potentially avoidable” Covid infections within the Trust.

A weather map on wxcharts, which is run by Met Desk, anticipates a huge band of snow to sweep across the UK next Thursday. The graphic shows that the white stuff could fall from the north of Wales to the south east of England. Meanwhile, Met Desk meteorologist Tamsin Green says the UK is heading into the apossnowiest, coldest week of the winterapos.  She added that snowfall is also expected this Sunday. Ms Green told The Mirror: Models are showing that at some point on Sunday morning itcould span from the east of England to Wales. Most parts of the UK will see a covering of snow. A few centimetres. Some parts could see in excess of  centimetres, most likely in East Anglia. Freezing easterly winds will lash the UK next week, making things feel even colder. Some forecasters are now questioning whether Britain could face a fresh aposBeast from the Eastapos. Netweather.tvaposs Jo Farrowsaid: Cold easterly wind and the snow showers will spread to moreBritain next week with widespread frost and ice, but is this a aposBeast from the Eastapos   Rather than having to label it just yet, take this as a heads up for a spell of much colder weather and possibly proper snowfall. Eastern Britain will be more in the firing line for the snow but with the deep cold, any frontal systems that do nip in from the SW could bring snow to other areas. And with brisk easterly winds the snow showers will manage to work their way right inland. Ms Farrow added that while this was aposstepping towardsapos becoming another Beast from the East, there was still an aposuncertain balance going onapos.  Netweather reports that temperatures will drop to -C in London next Wednesday, although the aposfeel likeapos temperature will be -C. It comes after the UK faces five days snow and ice warnings amid the threat of blizzards in some areas. Snow and ice is forecast across northern parts of the UK, while heavy rain could cause problems further south. The worst of the weather is expected in Scotland, where the Met Office has issued an amber alert for Friday and Saturday. More than five inches of snow is possible across much of Scotland on Saturday, while as much as  inches could fall on higher ground.

When Health Secretary Matt Hancock talked yesterday in Parliament about a Covid- aposmutation of concernapos found in Liverpool yesterday it reportedly took some in the city by surprise. And the iant - of which Mr Hancock said  cases had been found in the Merseyside city - has now been found in Preston and West Lancashire , say local health officials. People living in those areas are being urged to take a Covid- testthey are feeling unwell, with symptoms including a cold, mild flu and headaches. It comes after a host of postcodes started door-to-door surge testing after cases involving the South Africa Covid iant, feared to better evade vaccines, were detected. Dr Sakthi Karunanithi, director of public health and wellbeing at Lancashire County Council, said: If you live in Preston or West Lancashire and youaposre feeling under the weather, please get a Covid test. It doesnapost matteryou donapost have the three classic symptoms of a fever, loss of taste or smell, or a cough - even a headache could be an indication you may have this mutation. Understandably, some residents may be concerned but all viruses mutate over time so this should not cause any further alarm. Alongside our partners, please rest assured that we are monitoring the situation closely. It is important to stress that there is currently no evidence that this mutation alone causes more severe illness or is more transmissible. The Mirroraposs sister title the Liverpool Echo reports how Mr Hancockaposs announcement of the  cases, without offering any more detail, led to a slew of headlines and anxious questions about whether this was a new mutation making its way around the city. But the confirmation of the mutation was not exactly new to reporters in the area, as the paper had revealed that Public Health England was investigating a cluster of cases involving the EK mutation of the virus, that had been linked to a number of staff members from Liverpool Womenaposs Hospital. While confirmation of the mutation was not new, the number mentioned by the Health Secretary was. It would appear that those five confirmed cases have become , and that is what is concerning officials.  Plans are being worked up in terms of responding to any potential growth in the spread of this mutation and it is understood this is likely to involve enhanced testing. This mutation, known as EK, is already present in both South African and Brazilian coronavirus iants. The cluster in Liverpool has the same mutation but relate to the original strain of coronavirus that has been around since the start of the pandemic. Itaposs not a new iant, it is a mutation that has been previously detected in aposiants of concern.apos  A iant is a term used for genetically distinct viruses that have specic mutations that can be tracked and followed to identy clusters emerging and growing in the population. There are many thousands of these. They are identied as a iant of interest or concern when they have a particular constellation or cluster of mutations that are concerning, orthey are associated with changes in the virus. The majority of iants emerge and subsequently become extinct due to stopping transmission by testing, contact tracing and isolation. Scientists can also identy mutations of interest which arise independently in multiple dferent genetically distinct viruses.  Pubic Health England detected a cluster of linked cases with this mutation in Liverpool and are investigating further. Public Health England say there is currently no evidence that this mutation alone causes more severe illness or is more transmissible, which is good news. However it is reported to result in weaker neutralisation by antibodies in lab experiments and so aposmay need further investigation to understand more on immune response and how well vaccines work against it.apos "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle harrys staff in","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Harrys staff in tears of frustration and despair over Archie rowAn -month old change to Archie Mountbatten-Windsors birth certicate has caused a baffling row for Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, which experts believe follows on from their \"obsession\" with privacy surrounding their sons arrival in mirrorShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video meghan-markle-says-archie-birth-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Rather than following the approach used by Prince Charles and Princess Diana, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Sussexes did things their own way - keeping the location to themselves.The Daily Mailaposs Rebecca English claims that Harry became morbidly obsessed with keeping the information completely private, but many fans supported their decision. Reflecting on the time, she writes: Behind the scenes, matters were so fraught that more than one official — as I know from personal experience — was reduced to tears of frustration and despair.  The secrecy surrounding Archieaposs birth has become the topic of conversation again after it was revealed that just weeks after his birth Meghan and Harry changed their names on his birth certicate.It emerged that aposRachel Meghanapos, her first and middle names, were removed from her sonaposs certicate a month after giving birth. In its place, the document listed Archieaposs mum as the more formal aposHer Royal Highness the Duchess of Sussex.apos  It has caused a baffling row, with the couple claiming the decision came from Buckingham Palace while insiders say thataposs unlikely.Meghan and Harry released a strongly worded statement on the issue, saying: This was not requested by Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex nor by The Duke of Sussex. To see this UK tabloid and their carnival of so-called “experts” choose to deceptively whip this into a calculated family “snub” and suggest that she would oddly want to be nameless on her child’s birth certicate, or any other legal document, would be laughable were it not offensive. ‘There’s a lot going on in the world let’s focus on that rather than creating clickbait. Royal sources have revealed this has been met with a sense of “bewilderment” in the Palace. One royal source claimed that Meghan ordered her staff to make the change to Archieaposs birth certicate in order to to fall in line with amendments sheaposd already made to her passport. In short, Meghan already stylised herself as aposHRH The Duchess of Sussexapos, dropping her given names - and wanted some form of continuity.

But rewind two years and Kate feared she’d be left a widow at  bringing up their little boy alone, after their world fell apart when husband Phil was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Determined not to give up their dream of expanding their family, just three days after Phil’s diagnosis, he had his sperm frozen before starting chemotherapy. And that act of hope in the most devastating week of the couple’s le resulted in daughter Autumn - their “light at the end of the tunnel” – born on October , . Phil is now recovering well and the couple feel blessed they’ve got a second chance of happiness. “Our little girl is a symbol of hope and new beginnings for us as a growing family,” said Kate, , from Surrey. “It’s amazing knowing that Autumn was conceived with sperm frozen in the week her daddy was diagnosed with a brain tumour. After everything we’ve been through, for the first time in years we’re excited about le and our future looks bright.” Autumn’s birth was even more poignant as Kate had suffered six miscarriages trying to give Austin, now four – who was conceived in the couple’s first IVF attempt – the precious gt of a sibling. She lost three babies before Phil’s diagnosis and three while he was going through treatment using frozen embryos from treatment the first time round with Austin. “It was an emotional rollercoaster,” said Kate. “Phil was undergoing radiotherapy while I was having injections to stimulate my egg production. “I had three miscarriages over six months during his treatment, the first at six-and-half weeks and the other two at five weeks.” The couple decided to give having another baby “one final go” using the sperm Phil, , had frozen in the same week doctors told him he had a brain tumour.The couple’s ordeal started in November  when Phil was diagnosed with a brain tumour after suffering severe headaches, dizziness and tingling and numbness on his left-hand side. Doctors put the symptoms down to a sinus infection and then vertigo. Phil’s headaches intensied and sometimes he’d have to go to bed because he was in so much pain and nauseous. After five months, he saw a private GP through work and was referred for a scan, which revealed a large tumour spanning both hemispheres of his brain. Phil received the devastating news on his own as he hadn’t spotted the consultant’s email that they’d found an “anomaly” on his brain, and to bring someone with him. “He’d had an early appointment before work and I was woken up at am by the phone ringing,” said Kate. “Phil said, ‘It’s not good news, I’ve got a lump in my head that shouldn’t be there.’ “I think I stopped breathing. I was cuddled up with Austin and just couldn’t take in his words. He was a fit, healthy -year-old, brain tumours weren’t even on our radar. “The doctor told him to go home. On the train, Phil was on the phone to me and we were both crying. I went to meet him at the station with Austin and we clung to each other.” Kate couldn’t help herself fearing the worst. “My first thought was, ‘I’m going to be a widow at ,” she said. “Austin was only two and I was convinced Phil wouldn’t see him grow up and that we’d never have any more children. One minute le was normal, the next it was scary and unknown.”  Two days later, the couple went to see Phil’s consultant who broke the news he thought Phil’s tumour was cancerous. “We were told that Phil had to have surgery soon or he could die,” said Kate. “My mind went spiralling into a dark place as I thought we were going to lose him imminently. “Phil was so shocked he nearly got sick. “Then I asked about freezing Phil’s sperm as it was so important to both of us to have another child. “On the way home on the train everyone was enjoying their night out while he was white as a sheet and I was hysterical. “Back at home, I was straight on google and read that Phil’s prognosis may be  months, which made me feel even worse.” They coped by going into practical mode. “Phil dealt with our finances and I had a crash course in where everything was,” said Kate. “We didn’t have wills and did those, too. “Everything was sorted out in four days flat before Phil’s surgery.” Austin was only two when Phil was diagnosed but the couple were open as possible with him. “We told him, ‘Daddy has a poorly head’ and that he was having treatment to make him better,” said Kate.

Gemma Robinson, , suffered a fractured eye socket at the hands of her jealous ex-lover Joseph Falconer, . The mum-of-two was found dead just hours before the thug tried to secure his release from prison on bail. One month later he admitted inflicting GBH and has now been jailed for three years and four months. Gemma’s family, who watched the sentencing while holding a photo of her in court, say the term is not long enough. Sister Kirsty Robinson, , said: “She’s taken her le because of what he has done. That’s not justice. “He is  per cent to blame. Gemma was very outgoing, very friendly, popular but he left her unrecognisable as a person. “She was crying at night, struggling to get up in the mornings and be a mum, and was petried of coming to court and facing him.  “She wanted to face him and look strong but she was petried. She was a completely dferent person.” Fitness instructor Gemma started a relationship with railway worker Falconer in  but they split in January . Maidstone Crown Court was told one month earlier he had assaulted her and received a conviction for battery and criminal damage. Falconer later turned up at Gemma’s home and by October  she had agreed he could stay on her sofa.  Prosecutor Vivian Walters said: “He paid no rent and she bought and provided all his food. “His behaviour became increasingly controlling and he started to question her about where she was going and who she was going to see - similar behaviour to when they were in a relationship.” Jealous Falconer phoned and texted as much as  times after Gemma went for a night out with a friend. When she ed to her flat in Dartford, Kent, he forced her into a shower cubicle before punching her repeatedly in the face.  As well as the eye socket fracture, she suffered cuts and bruising to her head, face, arms, neck and chest. The brutal attack took place in November  and a charge of GBH with intent was initially denied by Falconer. However, one month after Gemma’s death last July he pleaded guilty to the lesser offence of inflicting GBH. Falconer, of St Leonards on Sea, East Sussex, who was subject to a restraining order at the time of the attack, was jailed on Wednesday.  He offered his sincere condolences to Gemma’s family through his barrister while appearing on video link from prison. Passing sentence, Recorder Matthew McDonagh told Falconer: “You involved yourself in what can only be described as a gratuitous and violent attack upon Gemma Robinson. “You held her neck, affecting her ability to breathe, and punched her repeatedly in the face, ending the assault with the indignity of spitting on her.

The sheet was discovered by Rosa Beckerton’s husband Peter, , while he was refurbishing an old piece of furniture for a client. It is dated February , , and appears to be written by an -year-old girl imagining the state of the world in . She correctly predicts a huge sht in technology and even forecasts the Zoom revolution. Describing her husband’shome from work she writes: “’Hello dear,’ he said to me. ‘I’ve just got to ring up my friend on the telephone’.What do you think about the schoolgirlaposs predictions  Let us know in the comments“’Well you’d better tidy yourself up a bit,’ I said. “In  the telephone was a square box thing with a resiver [sic] on top of it. “But now it is still a resiver [sic], but you can see the people you are talking to, for there is a screen where you can see the people. It is a bit like a television.” Upholsterer Peter found the note stuffed down the back of a sofa which was sent to him for restoration after being bought second-hand.  Rosa, , from Peterborough, Cambs., decided to make the it public in case the author, who would now be aged around , is still alive. She said: “When my husband showed it to me I couldn’t believe it. I thought oh my god, look at this. “It was just so interesting, because looking at it today she’s got a lot of her predictions kind of right - but in her childish innocent way she thought it would all happen in ten years.  “I just wanted to share it in the hopes that maybe the author might see it and recognise it. “My husband has found all sorts of rubbish down the side of sofas and furniture before - but never anything as interesting as this.” The letter is unnamed but comes complete with a teacher’s corrections and comments in red pen - including the verdict ‘Good’.  It begins: “The year is , the time is half-past moon dust. Here I am twenty-one years of age, sitting in a cushion of air. “I remember when I was  years old and I was at school, things have changed since then. “For instance, the television has changed. “In  it was a square box with knobs in front of it. Now it is a big screen with knobs on your chair arm to switch it on and off.” The schoolgirl imagines that she is a married bank worker. She says in times past she would have “prepared tea” ready for her husband to come home. But she adds: “All we have is a piece of chewing gum to eat. You may think that we have not enough to eat but you are wrong, because this piece of chewing gum is food.

Colouring pens, biros, paper, glue sticks, hand sanitiser and folders were among items delivered to Cubitt Town Junior School on the Isle of Dogs in East London. Head teacher Robyn Bruce told how the stock was “vital” for younger children home learning in deprived areas, many of who do not have access to the basics. The Mirror, in a joint appeal with the National Education Union , is urging readers and firms to dig deep to help kids struggling to learn at home.Tell us your thoughts on the Help a Child to Learn campaign in the comments belowSchool mum Khadija Khatun, , lives on the th floor of a tower block with her husband and five children - aged , , ,  and . As she was handed items from the delivery, she told the Mirror: “It’s really hard at home. “The school gave us a computer, and that’s great, but we also need other things which we have to go and buy.  “We really need scissors, glue, paper and pens and this will be really useful for us, so I’m very grateful for it. “Sometimes shops I go to have run out of stock and we just don’t have enough to go around. “My  and -year-olds need this kind of equipment more, and we’re really thankful for it.  “My husband is furloughed at the moment and we find out in Aprilhe will go back to work.” Year  key worker and vulnerable children at the school were delighted to get their hands on the delivery. Mid-way through a science lesson Arsenal fan Bradie Adu-Yeboah, , told us: “It’s great because it’s all new.  “I’ll use it for all the work I have to do at home. “I have a colouring book so I will definitely be using the colouring pens.” His classmate Che’nai Quatromini, also , said: “I’m doing a moon project at home but I don’t have enough paper so I can use this for my background.  “I can also colour it in and use it for the moon. It will be really helpful.” This week’s delivery was a sample of what schools will have sent to them. Schools will get vouchers for either £, £, or £,, depending on their need. So far, there are  schools due to receive vouchers. Some £, has so far been raised in addition to the NEU’s £ million donation when we jointly launched the campaign last week.  At Cubitt Town Junior School, which also has an infants’ school attached to it, parents collect packages each Friday to help with home learning. The items bought with the vouchers will help create more packs for the children working from home and for those in need. Ms Bruce said: “The lower down the age groups you go, the more this kind of equipment is needed.  “Having paper, pens, scissors, and glue sticks at home is so important - and people don’t realise that parents sometimes don’t have them. “We had a parent whose child filled their homework in with a felt tip, and we could barely read it. I spoke to them and they did not have a pen at home. “It’s something that is taken for granted. “Of course they need computers and iPads and online learning is important, but it’s deeper than that.  “We’ve got families where there are lots of children in one small place and just feeding them is a struggle - and then we’re asking them to buy pens and paper and glue as well. “That’s why these deliveries will make such a dference and we thank the Mirror and the NEU for all they’re doing. “We also want pupils to have time away from the screen and to be creative. “The ide between those children who are from families which have this equipment and those from families who don’t will continue to grow unless we can ensure they all have the right means to learn.  “So much of our budget is being used to help pupils through the pandemic and there will be all sorts of extras to pay for once they , so these packages help us a lot,” said Ms Bruce. Kevin Courtney, Joint General Secretary of the NEU, said: “It is fantastic that Cubitt Town Junior School will benefit from the Help a Child to Learn campaign.

Heather told the Ayrshire Post: “Mary was meant toto her work on Thursday, instead she has died on Wednesday.  “It wasn’t for the lack of my sister asking for help from the local GPs and the ‘magic’  number, she did phone and she tried to get help. She added: “My sister passed away, of course we will never know what might have happenedthey just took a bit more time with her, would she still be here  “We are incensed by the whole thing, her GP are going to investigate how she was treated. “She said ‘I’m never going to phone any of them again and ask for help, I’m just going to lie here and die’ that’s what has happened. “On the Wednesday when we were talking to her she was incoherent and breathless, we knew this had gone far enough and we told her partner to phone an ambulance.” “They found out she had a blood clot in her lung that had travelled up to her heat and caused a cardiac arrest.

After repeated efforts tothe TV, Mr Jones claims staff accused him of theft and warned him not to come back with the television. Mr Jones, who has learning dficulties, said: I nipped down to Tesco and went to look for TVs. We didn’t open it until the Friday afternoon because it took ages to get it out of the box because of the polystyrene. It wasn’t a Toshiba telly, it was an LG telly.

Mr Jones said he bought the TV on January , and spent the following two weeks attempting toit without any success. Mr Jones said: I’ve been down three times with a couple of my friends and I’ve been down once by myself but they kept giving me some excuse. The store then refused to sort it out and accused me of theft and told me not toback with the TV. I felt ashamed because Tesco said they didn’t provide that [the option tofaulty products].

Covid- vaccination is having an effect on cutting cases and death rates, with things looking optimistic for the summer months, Professor Karl Friston of University College Londonhas said. Modelling by UCL researchers suggests the reproduction numberfor coronavirus was . on February , which means the epidemic is shrinking. Thataposs according to experts from Professor Fistonaposs university, who say the third national lockdown has got the R rate down to the lowest it has been since the first.And speaking to the Sun, Professor Friston said lockdown is working and with the vaccine roll-out underway the UK could have vaccinate enough of the population to prevent the spread of the coronavirus this summer.What is your view  Have your say in the comments section Professor Karl Friston said the team had produced a most likely scenario going forward, with a progressive and gradual unlocking of society as restrictions are lted. He said that by July the UK could have reached a place where some people will still have ongoing infections but a form of herd immunity is reached via vaccination, natural immunity and social distancing. Technically, all herd immunity means is youaposve stopped exponential growth, he said, with the R number under one and no more need for lockdowns. Prof Friston, who is the scientic director at the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, added: The bottom line is that vaccination appears to be having a tangible effect on confirmed new cases and daily death rates recorded over the past few weeks. If the vaccination programme continues to unfold at its current pace - and lockdown is eased gradually as aof declining prevalence - we might attain herd immunity by as early as July. This encouragingforecast accommodates fluctuations in viral transmissibility. However, there is a lot of uncertainty about transmission risk that should nuance any interpretation of these predictions. These long-term predictions reflect a material response to the third lockdown that is clearly evident in declining incidence, hospital admissions and daily death rates.  At present, the reproduction ratio is estimated to be the lowest it has been since late April but is likely to rise gently again as restrictions are eased over the forthcoming months. It is believed that vaccinating up to  per cent of the population would be enough - while the R rate across the nation is already down to . .Prof Friston told said that there is light at the end of the tunnel, with reassuring modelling suggesting that a combination of the vaccine roll-out, warmer weather and the natural immunity some in population enjoy could spark the beginning of the end of the pandemic in July.The modelling did not take into account worst case scenarios, but was a realistic forecast and the most likely case.  He told the Sun: “It is a public information service telling the most likely outcome to expect going forward. When you actually run the numbers, things are much less catastrophic than they might appear.” He added: “The R rate is very good news. Not just in terms of the fact that that is substantially less than one, which means that thereaposs been there is currently an exponential decline in the prevalence of infection. “But, it shows our lockdown is working by minimising social contacts.” Prof Fristonaposs modelling is not a prediction, he said, but a likely scenario.  Friston, who is the Scientic Director Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, told the paper there is a strong possibility of le ing close to normal by mid-summer. Scientists are stopping short of raising the notion of le ing to exactly how it was post-pandemic.Today, Dr Phillip Gould of Coventry University told the Mirror the UK may never get fully back to how it was before the pandemic, with masks worn for yearsThe virologist said fears over mutant strains of Covid- could see Brits locked out of concert stadiums, sporting events and nightclubs with social distancing a key concern until into . And we may never go back to exactly how le was before the pandemic, with certain precautions becoming the norm forever - and social distancing until late this year, or even further. Regarding herd immunity, Prof Friston said  per cent among the population is needed to protect against Covid- in winter. But in summer, this becomes  per cent. However, not every scientist agrees with Prof Friston. Some urged caution over the modelling, with Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, saying: At the present time it is very dficult to estimate when or eventhe UKaposs Covid- vaccination programme will bring us to the herd immunity threshold.  The UCL study estimates the extent to which vaccination interrupts transmission which is one, but only one, of several unknowns about the long term impact of the vaccination programme. Last month, Professor Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, warned that herd immunity, where the unvaccinated are protected by others having the vaccine, cannot be achieved either through natural infection or the programme using the Pfizer BioNTech and Astra Zeneca jabs. He told Radio aposs Today programme that vaccines would allow ato near-normal le for large parts of society but those who refuse a jab will not be protected in the traditional sense by herd immunity. He said: The rolling out the vaccine is going to make a huge dference and going to enable us to relax many of the restrictions that weaposre under at the moment and, certainly as weaposre moving into spring when the better weather comes along, thataposll considerably help.  Prof Hunter said it was going to be pretty much impossible to reach herd immunity with the vaccines or through naturally-acquired infection. While vaccines were very good at stopping people getting severe illness and dying and will suppress spread of infection to other people, they will not completely stop it. There will continue to be a risk to those people who are not vaccinated, he said. The UEA study suggests that everyone, including children, would need to be inoculated with the Pfizer jab, which it said was more effective than the Oxford AstraZeneca one, in order for the UK to achieve herd immunity.  The World Health Organisation has previously it supports achieving herd-immunity through vaccination and not by allowing a disease to spread - which was Boris Johnsonaposs Governmentaposs plan at the very beginning of the pandemic. Sweden initially attempted to achieve natural herd immunity and did not lock down - but then cases spiked massively in December and the situation spiralled out of control. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus previously said: Herd immunity is a concept used for vaccination, in which a population can be protected from a certain virusa threshold of vaccination is reached. For example, herd immunity against measles requires about  per cent of a population to be vaccinated.  The remaining five per cent will be protected by the fact that measles will not spread among those who are vaccinated. For polio, the threshold is about  per cent. In other words, herd immunity is achieved by protecting people from a virus, not by exposing them to it. Never in the history of public health has herd immunity been used as a strategy for responding to an outbreak, let alone a pandemic. It is scientically and ethically problematic. However, vaccine minister said the UK will not be safe from Covid even after the vaccine roll-out, saying no one is really safe until the whole world is safe.  He told MPs that he was pleased by the news about the effectiveness of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, adding: This is, of course, really great news for us all. But we will not rest on our laurels - no one is really safe until the whole world is safe. Our scientic pioneers will keep innovating so we can help the whole world in our collective fight against this virus. Data from a study by the University of Oxford released this week suggested a single dose of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine offers protection of  per cent for up to three months and may reduce transmission by  per cent - with efficacy rising to . per cent after the second dose  weeks later.  It comes as Public Health England today released data showing case rates per , have fallen across all regions, as have hospitalisations.

While fears over mutant strains of Covid- could see Brits locked out of concert stadiums, sporting events and nightclubs with social distancing a key concern until into .Dr Phillip Gould of Coventry University says scientistsapos biggest worry is that new mutations in the coronavirus could threaten to move the UKaposs vaccine programme back.The more transmissible iant discovered in Kent has spread across the population and has out-competed the previous version, slowly taking over, said the expert, who is Coventry University’s Associate Head of School for Health and Le Sciences. It and the South African strain have raised fears among scientists that Covid- mutations could prove resistant to currently-approved vaccines. Dr Gould sounded a note of optimism, as amazing new technology developed by scientists allows them to adapt the vaccine, like we do every year with the flu vaccine. What is your view  Have your say in the comments section But while the UK is “lucky” to have vaccinated so many people at this point, and “well ahead of the game with vaccinations”, those hoping for ato full normality anytime soon may be disappointed, the doctor warns.And we may never go back to exactly how le was before the pandemic, with certain precautions becoming the norm forever - and social distancing until late this year, or even further. “I think social distancing will remain for a long time,” says Dr Gould. “Our way of le will change long-term. “Wearing a face mask in shops and on buses will remain for a long time, even after places and businesses have opened up. “The economy can get going in summer - but it won’t look like a normal summer. “We need long-term immunity and vaccination.” The wearing of masks and the fastidious washing of hands has already become a way of le in the UK, Dr Gould suggests, as it is in, for example, East Asian countries who experienced previous pandemics. “People’s perceptions have changed dramatically,” he says. “People go ‘where are my keys, where is my phone, and where is my mask’.” And while there is hope of some reprieve for bored Brits in the form of a summer holiday, it is unlikely that social events will be back with a bang anytime soon.  The virologist does not see Britain’s bustling nightle scene ing to the way it was this year. And there is little chance big sporting events will be able to enjoy big crowds for many months. “Not piling into places will remain the same for this year, definitely, long term,” he added. “We will have changed our culture dramatically, like not going to workyou’re feeling a bit ill - something many of us used to do.  “Are high risk places like nightclubs going to insist you have a test or vaccine before you go in   “Will we ever get the big football crowds back again  Long-term it’s possible.Dr Gould cited last yearaposs Cheltenham Festival - which has been blamed for a spike in cases in Gloucestershire after attracting , people between March  and  - and the Champions League match between Liverpool and Atletico Madrid - which went ahead on March  with thousands of away fans allowed in despite the Spanish capital emerging as a Covid epicentre - as big peaks in transmission.“We will be vaccinated, tests will be available, but I can’t see it until we are really confident that the vaccine programme is rolled-out - and that wonapost be until the end of the year, he added. Dr Gould also suggested that rapid lateral flow tests, which use a mouth and or nose swab, and can take about  minutes to give a result, will become very common before big events.  “We need to make sure the herd immunity is up, from the vaccination programme,” he adds. Dr Gould, whose research interests is based around the molecular characterisation of respiratory viruses, is optimistic that new vaccines can be made quickly. And he added the UK was very lucky with how many people have been vaccinated and that an enhanced vaccine infrastructure was now in place for years to come. The flexibility afforded by the UKaposs million doses of a vaccine from the French pharmaceutical company Valneva, that should become available later in the year and into , is another reason for optimism.  However, the Dr cautions that scientists face a constant race between the virus changing, which it will do, and our ability to predict that and make new vaccines. He adds: The worry is the more mutations we have. The more we can get reinfected and the less effective vaccines will be. The biggest worry is that they continue to circulate, the more chance it has to mutate again. At high levels it will continually mutate. The more it does - the bigger the chance vaccines will be less effective.  There are currently two Covid- vaccines being administered in the UK, but five more are in the pipeline and the government has million doses in total on order. Vaccines tested through clinical trials last year were tested on a population where the new strains were not circulating. But the Novavax vaccine, of which  million doses are expected to be delivered to the UK later this year, was trialled when the Kent strain was circulating. Approval by the UKaposs Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency is expected in several weeks.  But as scientists do not yet know how long immunity lasts, Dr Gould suggests vaccinations for the coronavirus could become a regular thing, like with the flu. He said: “We are going to have to continually vaccinate, and the Government is preparing for that. “Like with the flu, which is constantly changing and evolving, coronaviruses have been circulating in humans for s of years, but only caused minor infections up to now. “Getting vaccinated is really important offering really good protection for all strains over time.  “But over time, the immunity or protection may slow down, similar to other viruses. “It might be every year, or every two years you might have to go back for a boost, but the infrastructure is now in place, so that you will be able to do it. The current full national lockdown with the most strictest of restrictions could last at least another month, probably longer even after schools are open, Dr Gould feels, as numbers are still not good. Government is clearly reacting and detecting cases of these iants - whether they can control it is another thing, added the Dr.  We have got to treat all these coronaviruses the same, you must self-isolate, follow best practice. Because they are more effective at infecting people, any lockdown could be moved later simply because we have another iant in the mix. Numbers are low but it only takes one superspreader in these areas [where the iants are prevalent] to see numbers back up. Case numbers are going down but we’re still in a very critical point. We have got to get people vaccinated quickly, they have got to get their booster. As for hopes of a summer holiday, as Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Sunday said Brits will hopefully be in the middle of a happy and free summer in six monthsapos time, Dr Gould is also cautiously optimistic, saying a summer holiday in the UK could happen.I think we will be able to have a holiday, just a very dferent holiday than we are used to, whether UK-based or abroad, some restrictions will still be there, he added.The way the virus spreads in summer is dferent, and we will have more people vaccinated by then. There will be lots of hiccups and shortfalls, but people should be hopeful for summer.We are already seeing the good news stories with people celebrating they have been vaccinated.

The humble flour, eggs and milk mix has risen to the top and beaten rivals from across the country from arch rival Lancashire hotpot and Devon and Cornwall’s cream teas to Cheddar cheese and Haggis. Figures from supermarket chain Tesco show sales of Yorkshire puds have soared  per cent year-on-year and one in five Brits reckon it’s the best part of a roast dinner. While they are eaten by millions at least once a week, almost half have never made one from scratch, the survey of more than , adults found.Are you a fan of the humble Yorkshire pudding  Let us know in the comments belowA quarter insist Yorkies must be served with gravy and more than one in  only tuck in on Sundays as part of the traditional roast and feel it’s wrong to have them midweek. Bizarrely, almost one in  revealed they had Yorkshire pud as a dessert with ice cream and chocolate sauce, fruit or marmalade. And one in  have used the versatile batter mix to make a pizza base, according to research ahead of National Yorkshire Pudding Day on Sunday .  Tesco’s executive chef Jamie Robinson said: “Making a good Yorkshire pudding can be tricky to master, but once you do there isn’t much better. The order in which you add the ingredients is key to how much they will rise.” He revealed the secret to great Yorkies is to beat the eggs then slowly add flour and finally add the milk a little at a time for a smooth mixture and let it rest - ideally overnight - for the best results.  Mr Robinson said: “I like to add some additional flavour into my Yorkshire pudding mixture, depending on what I am eating them with. For example,I am serving them with roast chicken then I will add some thyme into the batter. “Alternatively, when serving alongside roast beef, I will add in horseradish and rosemary - delicious.” But Yorkshire folk may raise an eyebrow over his brunch recipe of Yorkies filled with cream cheese, salmon, a runny poached egg and a sprinkling of chopped chives.

He claims he never went inside her home and had no idea what was awaiting him inside when be bought it. Speaking to Bored Panda, Alex said: I was told she had a modest income and so I wasn’t expecting much.When I saw the inside of the house for the first time, I was a bit shocked at the state of the home as she was a very nicely dressed lady.It was in an extreme state of hoarding. In fact, the only reason I bought the contents was because I thought it might be a fun adventure for our YouTube channel and at very least, I would get a grand piano.It was impossible to see what was in the house because of how full it was at the time. Places were piled up to the ceiling. However, after spending some time looking through the home, Alex soon discovered that it was full of some brilliant items, including vintage gold jewellery, designer clothes, money, and a -ounce silver bar.There were boxes with big name brands all over the place, including Chanel and Tfany  Co. Little did I know that the eccentric piano teacher I had met was, in fact, a millionaire, he proclaimed.Alex documented the treasure they uncovered in the house in multiple videos on his YouTube channel and estimated that theyaposd found around £,worth of stuff."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds fan shares how makes","story":"NewsMcDonalds fan shares how he makes nuggets even tastier - and you only need one thingA TikTok user known as HoodMeals shared the quick and simple way he upgrades his McDonalds nuggets at home and all you need is one common cupboard itemmirrorShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video mcdonalds-fan-shares-how-makes-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

One exhausted mum who felt exactly this way shared what she made for her kids when she couldnapost be bothered and parents have praised her for being real about the food she makes.Posting on the Facebook group Mums Who Cook  Bake, the parent said when she doesnapost feel like slaving over a hot oven, sheaposll often put together a pick plate which consists of a iety of healthy snacks that her kids love.On the plate was some chopped grapes and banana, grated cheese, slices of corn on the cob and leftover dim sum. Since being posted, the picture has received hundreds of likes from fellow group members who praised her for sharing a dinner that was relatable. One mum said: It has fruit, vegetable, dairy and possibly some form of protein in that dim sum.It’s a balanced meal!.

The photograph shows what initially appears to be an unremarkable outdoor swimming pool with nobody inside the water. Except a circled area of the poolreveals that a child is in fact beneath the water but practically invisible to the naked eye. The child was captured wearing pale blue shorts swimming near the bottom of the swimming pool but because of the colour he would prove dficult to see by anyone observing.Australian Facebook group CPR Kids, run by expert paediatric nurses, shared the image in a bid to warn parents to make sure their children wear visible and brightly coloured clothing while in the water.  On Facebook the group said: Yes, there is a child there, itaposs hard to believe we know. Following on from out post recently on the importance of fluoroand bright coloured swimwear for kids, one of the CPR Kids Educators was at a pool party with friends and noticed how cloudy the water had become after being used all day. She asked one of the children who was wearing a pale blue swimsuit, to swim to the bottom. The result shocked her, as it did everyone in the CPR Kids team. The original Facebook post has attracted hundreds of comments from those who were shocked by the stark image, and it has since been widely shared since it was put online.  ridiculously beautul photos from the Travel Photographer of the Year awards"},{"url":null,"title":"young bride cries how live","story":"NewsYoung bride cries ‘how will I live without you ’ as groom shot dead on wedding dayRadu Cordinianu and his brother Philip Cordinianu were shot dead by two guests on the brides side hours after the former had tied the knot with his young lovemirrorShareByFeza UzayJoseph WilkesReporter:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video couple-look-loved-up-wedding-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Footage shows the newly wedded couple celebrating their big day just hours before the groom and his brother were shot dead by the guests, who were on the bride’s side. The incident took place at a country club in the village of Vlasovo in the Russian region of Moscow Oblast, on January . The groom, Radu Cordinianu, , and his brother Philip Cordinianu, , were shot dead on the second day of the wedding festivities when a row broke out between Radu and the two suspected killers, Alexey D and Vladimir D. The situation quickly escalated and the suspects fired six or seven gunshots, leaving the Cordinianu brothers dead at the scene. According to news site Le, the two suspects were detained in Moscow the following day. The bride, identied only with her first name Christina, addressed her deceased fiancee with heartbreaking words. In an Instagram post, she wrote: How am I going to live without you, my beloved man  “I will always be your we. I promise. You are my only one. We will be together forever.  Just be there, look at me from above, and I will fulfil all our dreams for you so that you are proud of me. Sleep well, my dear, and I will try to survive this pain.

It’s up to us to make sure we get it right.“It’s been a frustrating season for Callum. He’s one of the young ones with real first-team experience in the Premiership and he had been doing really well in pre-season. Then he picked up a chest infection and broke his foot in a friendly.“He’s had to be patient and had been doing really well in training. Last week we’d been working on how to play against Raith and he did really well. He deserved his chance.“He’s another good young player from the academy who can help the club.“We’ve had Max Anderson and Fin Robertson as well who’ve done great. Then there’s another group coming through – Sam Fisher made his debut on Saturday and Lyall Cameron has been doing well.“What we are looking for is to get that balance right in midfield in the hole left by Jordan McGhee’s injury.”The simplicity of Raith Rovers’ equalising goal at the weekend through former Dee Kyle Benedictus from a short corner was a huge frustration for McPake.Their second also came indirectly from another short corner, this time Reghan Tumilty firing in a superb -yarder after Dundee had cleared.That’s after conceding from a corner against Arbroath in the previous fixture and the Dundee boss admits “we need to get set-plays right”.“It was really frustrating to lose the first goal from a set-piece,” he added.“The second comes from the corner but ends up being an unbelievable strike.“Set-pieces are massive in football, at every level. As a player I always felt they were hugely important and that hasn’t changed now.“We were missing two of our most experienced players in Liam Fontaine and Lee Ashcroft – that’s not to say the two centre-backsdidn’t do well.“But that experienced allows them to organise and spot danger quicker, those goals might not have happened.“The third goal is a really good strike as well but we had chances ourselves. On another day, the result might have been dferent.“But we need to get set-plays right. It’s a bugbear of the players as well and we’re determined to sort it out.“We feel we have the best delivery in the league at the other end with Charlie Adam but we need to be better at defending them ourselves.” vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/02/Mr-Barnes-and-Andre-Kalama8731-e1612454195318-300x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/02/Mr-Barnes-and-Andre-Kalama8731-e1612454195318-620x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/02/Mr-Barnes-and-Andre-Kalama8731-e1612454195318-940x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/02/Mr-Barnes-and-Andre-Kalama8731-e1612454195318-300x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"long read what does remote learning look like for pupils in tayside and fife schools","story":"Remote learning has transformed not only the way teachers teach but the concept of the classroom.

Some do exist, however, and while not attempting to be a comprehensive history, there is a nicely illustrated booklet about the hospital and its past entitled #Up The Brae#, produced a few years ago by Brenda Bratt, Jess Grant and my former colleague Dr Grace Fergusson .These photographs are a reminder of the loss of a signicant social and economic element in the fabric of Mid Argyll, where for generations it would have been dficult to find a family without some connection to #the AB#. For those who worked there, myself included, any sadness however is much more about the loss of a self-sufficient and widely respected mental health service.I was a late participant in the story of the AB, being appointed physician superintendent in , a post I held in addition to that of clinical director for mental health services for Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire until , and I feel a duty to the many splendid colleagues with whom I worked to comment on the loss of the service in which the AB served as the nucleus.During the course of   the hospital was awarded the accolade #Best Mental Illness Hospital in Britain# as the result of a national competition launched by the King’s Fund and sponsored by the Sunday Times. This was a recognition of the multi-disciplinary spirit and enthusiasm for innovation that characterised the service, and the ethos of best clinical practice being led by academic excellence. The service went on to be recognised as a centre of excellence by many visiting accreditation bodies.My reason for making these points has nothing to do with nostalgia.The past has no utility in the present or the future except as a source for learning how best to proceed.The ingredients for a good mental health service are the same today as they were in  and they have little to do with buildings or even location. Staff have to feel they #belong# to something there must be a collegiate spirit binding together the ious disciplines shared professional development and peer support and clear lines of accountability. It is frankly hard to see any such features in the current delivery of mental health care.Someone once said #psychiatry isn’t sexy#, meaning that in any competition for resources with other clinical specialities, psychiatry will always lose, and so to get the best out of the NHS for folk with psychiatric disorder, exceptional effort is required. The achievements and values of the past can act as a springboard for such effort, but here they seem to have been squandered by a distant and disinterested health board.It is all too easy to avoid investing in a service by reorganising it into invisibility, but the people who pay the cost are those who deserve the best of specialist professional help.So I am certainly sad at the disappearance of the old AB, because it is symbolic of something having been lost that is much more important than stones and mortar.Professor Angus Mackay OBE FRCPsych, ArdrishaigSir,Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns over whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But though customers# usage of data more than doubled, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m also proud of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.We#ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland Director, Alexander Graham Bell House, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 8 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is ridiculous. I have attended  years of meetings on the A and all we get is fobbed off with pathetic excuses.We need a government which will deliver results, not spend all its time plotting to get independence while ignoring the real issues like a closed A which blight people#s lives.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,As we move into  and parents, teachers and pupils once again find themselves facing additional challenges to deliver and attain a full and rounded education, it is worthwhile remembering the role that music can and should play in improving our lives.Firstly, music will help to support and sustain our young people through the coming months. For children and adults alike, the creative arts play a vital role in promoting wellbeing and positive mental health, providing both a means of expression during the isolation of #lockdown# and a practical as well as enjoyable pastime.Secondly # and just as importantly # playing an instrument is complementary to academic subjects and has been shown emphatically to improve wider educational success. As we consider the often daunting challenge of theto home schooling, those parents whose children can mix domestic timetables with musical lessons will understand the release and stimulation playing an instrument can deliver.Across society music is integral to our identities and is made to be shared. We now have the means to do that successfully and safely with online tools whose use has been well-honed by recent experience.So whether you#re at the start of a musical journey, or are well advanced in music-making let#s keep singing, keep dancing and keep music lessons flowing, particularly while the restrictions necessitated by the pandemic keep us apart in our own homes.Dr Kenneth Taylor, head teacher, St Mary’s Music School, EdinburghSir,As Scotland faces a second national lockdown, the country#s national walking charity, Paths for All, is encouraging the public to explore local walking routes in a bid to help combat social isolation, anxiety and loneliness while maintaining physical health.The call follows the launch of the charity#s Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, which asks people to make the pledge of walking every day throughout January.The campaign includes an online hub which outlines the importance of walking and regular physical activity during the winter months. A iety of activities and ideas, designed to motivate iniduals of all ages, are available on the hub with podcast recommendations, creative walking advice and prize incentives.In what is traditionally the time of year which sees a surge of gym memberships and fitness plans we suggest taking up walking instead as part of our new year resolutions.With walking being one of the few essential reasons for leaving your home, it is the perfect exercise and now is the time to get into a walking exercise routine which is consistent with the current government guidelines. Walking can help with our social health as the guidelines allow us to meet with one person from one other household outside.Last year we saw an increase in Scots taking up walking during the first lockdown and the outcome has highlighted just how many benefits are attributed to walking and how outdoor exercise as many times a day as we can has become an important way to look after physical and mental wellbeing.Follow the campaign over on Paths for All social media channels #WalkOnceADay.For more information on the Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, visit the Paths for All website.Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer, Paths for AllSir,The New Year is usually a time for a fresh start – making resolutions, getting fit, setting new challenges and goals. But with the continuing uncertainty caused by the COVID- pandemic, it seems harder to commit to making a change.With restrictions ongoing, it’s becoming even more important for us to find new and innovative ways to raise vital funds for NSPCC Scotland to help children at risk of abuse and neglect.Children have been greatly affected by the pandemic. Since the first lockdown measures were introduced, the average monthly number of referrals from the NSPCC’s helpline to agencies in Scotland, such as the police or children’s services, have been more than  per cent higher than the first three months of . And the effects are far from over.Even with social distancing, there are still many ways you can fundraise for us.From hosting a virtual quiz or coffee morning to selling handmade crafts, cakes or old clothes, we’ve got lots of great virtual fundraising ideas you can try while following the Scottish Government#s advice on social distancing.By volunteering just a couple of hours each month to fundraise in your  area, you can help to make  a better year for children.So please think about using your new year passion and enthusiasm to come up with some ideas to fundraise and help us be there when children need us most.To find out more or to request your fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk or contact jen.lindsay@nspcc.org.uk by email.Jen Lindsay, community fundraising manager, NSPCC Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"boaters urged to abide by covid rules","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The revised guidance recognises that travel is severely restricted by law and owners may only travel to their boatit is kept in the same local authority area they live in.RYA Scotland, Sail Scotland and British Marine Scotland have joined together to encourage boat owners to use the services of staff where their boat is stored,at all possible, in an effort to avoid making a journey, to respect that storage providers may not be able to open and to advise owners to contact providers before travelling to confirm access.The information is tailored towards RYA affiliated clubs and recognised training centres as well as inidual members and the wider boating community across Scotland.James Allan, chief executive officer at RYA Scotland, said: #Lockdown will be disappointing for everyone, but it is still possible to go boating as a form of exercise and spending some time afloat or near the water is great for our wellbeing. It is important to remember we are in the grip of a pandemic that has become signicantly worse in recent weeks. The overriding message for Scotland’s boating community is to stay at home wherever possible as we must all help stop the spread of the virus.#Importantly in this lockdown, owners may travel within their local authority to undertake essential maintenance on their boat but may not stay longer than theof time required to undertake essential maintenance.To check what level of measures apply in your area or venue where you intend to participate in activity, please check the postcode on the Scottish Government webpage.In the meantime, RYA Scotland has decided to postpone its directly organised, non-virtual events and training in response to these measures to protect participants, volunteers and others and to reduce the risk of placing an additional burden on the emergency services at what is a hugely testing time.The RYA will be providing a range of online events and #SailFromHome activities. RYA Scotland will continue to host online sessions for clubs and training centres and deliver its regular podcast #Off the Water# to keep the boating community informed.PIC:Owners may only travel to their boatit is kept in the same local authority area they live in. _aTarbertHarbour"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 15 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark, which is grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are # the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,In order to avoid fishermen being adversely impacted by export delays, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross has called on the UK Government to bring forward compensation to the affected fishermen and deliver it immediately.The SNP government must also accept responsibility and deal with ongoing issues involving their agency, Food Standards Scotland, which are holding up exports within Scotland.Both of Scotland’s governments must work together to deliver for Scottish fishermen.We in the Scottish Conservatives will back Scotland’s fishing communities all the way.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,The Scottish SPCA is appealing to animal lovers in Scotland to donate much-needed food to its National Wildle Rescue Centre in Fishcross, Alloa.Scotland#s animal welfare charity had its busiest ever year in  with over , wildle casualties admitted.The pandemic caused quite a signicant drop in the number of animals arriving at the wildle hospital. Over , wild animals were brought to the centre in .As we are entering fox cub season, we are appealing for Pedigree puppy food and puppy milk.Last year, we cared for  foxes, of which  were cubs. It can be a struggle to keep up with so many hungry mouths to feed.We expect to be even busier with admissions this year so we need help from members of the public.If anyone can help with food for these young mammals, we would appreciate anything that people can spare.Puppy meat can be purchased from the wildle centre#s Amazon wishlist http:amzn.to xkUe.Steven Gray Scottish SPCA National Wildle Rescue Centre managerSir,New Year resolutions can be a good starting point for making longer term health and lestyle improvements, but most people do not stick to them. Reasons for quitting include a lack of time, a lack of support from other people and feeling daunted by unrealistic targets.Often, goals are unachievable because they are too dficult, or they do not allow enough time for you to make gradual changes.There is nothing wrong with aiming high and being ambitious, but it is important that your goal is not too dficult or time-consuming as this could leave you feeling daunted.Ask yourself the following questions: Is the goal too ambitious  Is the timeframe realistic  What specic changes do I need to make  Can I fit my new healthy behaviour around my other commitments Breaking large goals down into smaller goals can make them feel more achievable and less daunting.For example,you are aiming to lose weight, the NHS recommends that you aim to lose around  to lbsa week. You should be able to achieve this by cutting down your calorie intake by about  to  calories each day. It might take longer than planned to lose the weight, but you are more likely to stick to it and not give up.Plan how you will achieve your goal and what changes you will make to ensure you stick to it. There are online resources available to help you plan your healthy activities, such as the NHS couch to km programme or the NHS programmes for stopping smoking, cutting down alcohol and losing weight.Try to be patient and don’t expect the results from just one or two weeks of dieting to show on the weighing scales, as it may take longer.A good way to motivate you is to involve other people. If you know someone who has a similar goal to yours, try to involve them as a #buddy# to provide mutual support.They may even be able to push you a little bit harder, helping you to achieve your goals sooner. Look for groups on social media who share your goal.If you miss a fitness session or have an alcoholic drink, cigarette or bar of chocolate, try not to feel guilty. Think about what might have triggered the deviation from your goal and try to avoid it in future. Forgive yourself and aim to get back to achieving your goal as soon as possible.On average, it takes between  and  days for something to become a long-term habit. Make goals that you want to be able to stick to long term, such as improving your overall fitness, stopping smoking or maintaining your weight.If you can make it through these first few weeks, you will notice that things will become much easier.Dr Helen Flaherty, head of health promotion and education, Heart Research UK"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 22 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The cost of the items was £., but postage £.!How this can be justied is beyond my reckoning. I have purchased items online where the postage exceeds the cost of the item. There is little point in complaining, since no-one listens, certainly not the carriers.It is my opinion that many retailers who are depending on online shopping are losing trade because of this ongoing problem, one that needs urgent attention.Bryan Passey, LochgilpheadSir,For everyone,  was a dficult year.The situation is particularly challenging for those living with sight loss. Many have faced anxiety, sadness and even fear about the unique challenges they have experienced # problems such as social distancing, dficulty shopping without guidance and isolation from losing tactile contact with friends and family during lockdown.That’s why RNIB has launched emergency mental health sessions for blind and partially sighted people.The sessions are completely free and offer people with sight loss the opportunity to speak to a counsellor for an hour over the phone, about however they are feeling and any problems that are on their mind. It doesn’t have to be about their sight at all.If you, or someone you know, could benefit from speaking to someone, please call our Helpline on   . We can set up a chat within  hours and the service can be used as many times as needed.James Adams, director, Royal National Institute of Blind People Scotland, EdinburghDear Alister,In the weeks since the UK left the European Union, I have been contacted by numerous Argyll and Bute residents and businesses who share my very deep concerns about the future sustainability and, indeed, the survival of our vital shellfish and fishing sector.The seafood sector is a vital component of our already-fragile regional economy and is now hit by the inability, virtually overnight, for producers and processors to get their time-sensitive products to market or to customers.If allowed to go unresolved, this sector is likely to disappear, badly affecting Argyll and Bute’s overall recovery and future growth.Fish and shellfish from Argyll and Bute are high quality products of international renown.The industry has been a mainstay and a major employer in the area for many decades, sustaining not only the local economy but making a signicant contribution to the Scottish and UK economies.I am now hearing from long-standing fishing families, newer start-up businesses and companies employing hundreds of people that,urgent action is not taken, they will have to close their doors for good.This would be devastating for Argyll and Bute, where the sector comprises many single-family operated vessels, smaller fleets and artisan producers as well as some medium to larger enterprises.As a council we are doing all that we can to support these businesses and prevent this imminent disaster.Our officers are working behind the scenes to assist and are in constant discussions with the Scottish Government to reiterate the critical need for the commercial hubs to operate smoothly, ensuring that the right processes are in place to help businesses get their goods to their customers.We are also speaking to Argyll and Bute producers to help them navigate these new processes and to issue all the necessary paperwork where appropriate, so that these valuable products reach buyers.Delays on both sides of the border have already seen valuable products being lost, together with valued customers who are seeking their produce where.Very urgent action and assistance is needed now from your government in order to prevent this traditional Scottish industry sector from disappearing altogether.Most urgently of all, getting products to market must be streamlined, simplied and speeded up.These products need to be prioritised over products with longer shelf lives –the situation is allowed to persist then very many companies will have no choice but to give up, costing jobs and much-needed revenue to the treasury.In addition to improving processes and the speed of delivery here in the UK, these businesses, so vital to Argyll and Bute and Scotland’s economic recovery and future success, need your government to negotiate urgently with its counterparts in Europe to identy and resolve the delays in allowing fresh goods to arrive in and then to progress on to customers.I cannot state strongly enough that these actions are needed now. More is required, though, in the medium and longer terms, to help this beleaguered industry to get afloat again and regain some buoyancy.Producers and customers need reassurance that future supplies will be prioritised and to regain confidence in the industry through dedicated marketing and investment where possible through the £m fisheries fund your government announced following the publication of the agreement.Our seafood sector desperately needs Government to take action to secure its survival. Please do what you can, urgently, to avoid its demise.Robin Currie, Argyll and Bute Council leader"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 29 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But with the continuing uncertainty caused by the Covid- pandemic, it seems harder to commit to making a change.With restrictions ongoing, it’s becoming even more important for us to find new and innovative ways to raise vital funds for NSPCC Scotland to help children at risk of abuse and neglect.Children have been greatly affected by the pandemic. Since the first lockdown measures were introduced, the average monthly number of referrals from the NSPCC’s helpline to agencies in Scotland, such as the police or children’s services, have been more than  per cent higher than the first three months of . And the effects are far from over.Even with social distancing, there are still many ways you can fundraise for us. From hosting a virtual quiz or coffee morning to selling handmade crafts, cakes or old clothes, we’ve got lots of great virtual fundraising ideas you can try while following the Scottish Government’s advice on social distancing.By volunteering just a couple of hours each month, fundraising in your local area, you can help make  a better year for children.So please think about using your new year passion and enthusiasm to come up with some ideas to fundraise and help us be there when children need us most.To find out more or to request your fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk support-us events-fundraising new-year-challenge or email jen.lindsay@nspcc.org,ukJen Lindsay, community fundraising manager for NSPCC Scotland.A new survey by the Stroke Association shows that  per cent of people in Scotland don’t know that high blood pressure is the biggest risk factor for stroke, one of the leading causes of death and disability in Scotland.This is really worrying because . per cent of people in Scotland have high blood pressure.Smoking, drinking alcohol, being physically inactive and sitting for long periods, can contribute to high blood pressure, diabetes, and being an unhealthy weight, all of which increase your risk of stroke.You can start to reduce your risk of stroke by making small changes to your lestyle.To launch the first ever national Stroke Prevention Day on January , we’ve worked with our partners at the Rotary Club, LoSalt and OMRON Healthcare to help you make #OneSmallChange to reduce your risk of stroke.It’s often easiest to start off small and pick something that’s achievable for you.This may be swapping your after-work alcoholic drink for a soft one, getting up and moving regularly during the day, cutting down on salt or sugar, or joining an online exercise group.Just go to our website www.stroke.org.uk PreventionDay and receive tailored advice plus monthly emails with hints and tips.We would like you to pledge to make the change for three months, then let us know how you get on and how you found ways of sticking to your pledge.The things you tell us will help others across the UK to reduce their risk of stroke and lead a healthier lestyle in .Juliet Bouverie, chief executive, The Stroke Association. "},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week january 15 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The problem is, Smithy, a teacher#s nightmare, causes so much chaos that the head teacher ends up on a le support machine.Enter Dr Hannibal Lecture, the replacement head, and the stage is set for a war of nerves. The musical is on next Thursday, Friday and Saturday, with the curtain going up at .pm.West Coast Motors will be extending its local town service to include the school on the three nights of the production.FIFTY YEARS AGOPaul abroadWhile the financial problems of the Beatles are being investigated in London, Paul McCartney is believed to be in America. He left his farm, High Park, on January , after celebrating the New Year there with his we and children.Visit on # but support is neededConfirmation has been received from the mayor of the French village of Montbeliard that a party of Campbeltonians will be welcome at the village#s music festival on July - this year.Provost Dan McKinven told the Courier: #I now propose to call a meeting within the Town Council Chambers of all interested in taking part. I would expect representation from pipers, Highland and Scottish country dancers, choirs and pop groups. Any inidual performer would also be welcome as a cross-section of our community and its talent is essential.#The present plan is to travel directly from Campbeltown to Montbeliard by luxury coach. The village is about km from the Swiss border and the city of Basel.Provost McKinven added: #We would expect to form a committee which would be responsible for organising the finance and travel arrangements for about  people inclusive of press, photographer and artists.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOTwo boys birchedAt a children#s court last Friday – Sherf McMaster Campbell on the bench – two boys were charged with the theft of purses containing money from a house in Burn Road. The crime was admitted.The boys, it appeared, were messengers, and the younger one was in the habit of calling at the house in this capacity daily. The purses were taken on separate days. On the first occasion a purse containing £ s d had been left lying on a small table near the window of one of the rooms. The window was probably partially open. After the younger boy#s visit in the afternoon it was missed.Next day a purse containing s d was left in the same position, and on the boy calling at the house, the occupier challenged him with the theft. He admitted taking the purse and handed it over to the owner. Only  shillings of the  shillings and sixpence remained in the purse.While this interview was going on at the back door of the residence, the older boy, who accompanied the other on the second occasion, appeared to have devoted his attention to the room where the first purse was got, and he possessed himself of the second purse and its contents. His lordship sentenced each of the culprits to receive seven strokes with the birch rod."},{"url":null,"title":"letters january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I see Loch Fyne langoustines are sent to the EU but, living fairly close to Loch Fyne, I don#t seem to be able to purchase the product locally.I am sure UK supermarkets would be only too happy to sell, crabs, lobsters and langoustines provided by Scottish fishermen but it seems they would prefer to supply the EU rather than the home market.Fishing boats enter Campbeltown Loch regularly but there is no local supply of their catch as this is transported #up the road# as soon as it is landed.I just suggest that supplying the UK market is maybe a way out of the continual problems with our #friendly# neighbours who seem hell bent on putting continual obstacles in the way of sensible trading partnerships.Keith Abendroth, Campbeltown.I grew up in Peninver and have been hiking on the hills around the Rest and Be Thankful many times, all year round. My initial thought a few years ago was that the best solution to the problem of landslides on the Rest was building avalanche tunnels like there are on the A at Lochcarron but there is practically zero ground to build on on the downhill side of the A.The big catch-pits along the uphill side of the road do seem to work but, in the long-term, removing the unstable soil and planting lots of trees and shrubs on the rest of the hillside to hold it in place, might be the best solution.Rather than replace the road through the Rest and Be Thankful with a new route through another glen or to continue trying to stop an unstable hillside from obeying the laws of gravity, how much would it cost to remove all the soil in these watercourses which regularly slide Maybe cost-wise removing the unstable soil from the Rest would be cheaper # and quicker  # than building a whole new road If there is a landslide in a watercourse, it weakens the soil directly above it so that will slide next, followed by the soil above it, etc. The bedrock at the Rest is only a couple of feet below the surface so removing the soil in gullies liable to slide after rain might be a lot cheaper than building a new road through another glen.For a permanent solution, perhaps close off the road from Ardgartan to the Lochgoilhead junction for six months in the winter, pipe water from Loch Restil to the top of the gullies prone to sliding # at the base of the first exposed bedrock high up the gullies # let the water run for three or four months, and hydraulically remove all the loose soil, then in the spring shovel all the accumulated debris of the other side of the road It would mean short-term inconvenience for a lot of people but it might save a lot of money, time, and perhaps lives, in the long-term.Harry Hood, New Hampshire, USA. As children and young peopleto being home-schooled due to the new lockdown, there is no doubt that this will have a continued detrimental impact on mental health and wellbeing.As a coalition, we applaud the Scottish Government’s greater investment in mental health services. However, a view we share with other organisations, is that this investment is simply not sufficient.Mental health services were already under immense strain prior to Covid-, with children waiting considerable s of time for support. Recent statistics from December, for example, point to the fact that more than , children have been waiting over a year for treatment.This pandemic will only serve to make matters even worse as services deal with a backlog of those already suffering from mental health problems, added to which will be those who have developed problems over the course of lockdown.What is needed is a national crusade, delivering signicant investment in the public, private and third sectors to deliver adequate mental health support, both during and as we recover from Covid-. We must also use this as an opportunity to radically transform our mental health services, both for now and for the future, refocusing on prevention and early intervention.In the meantime, we would urge those children and their families who feel they need help not to hold back and look to get the support they need.The Scottish Children’s Services Coalition: Kenny Graham, Falkland House School Lynn Bell, LOVE Learning Stephen McGhee, Spark of Genius Niall Kelly, Young Foundations.The serious neurological condition Myalgic Encephalomylitiswill sadly be all too familiar to some of your readers at least , children and adults in Scotland live with ME, also diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome .Many face barriers in accessing health and social care services that meet their needs, and some professionals still don’t understand the impact of ME and its symptoms.UK charity Action for ME is trying to change this by offering people with ME across Scotland one-to-one advocacy, via phone and email, to help them be heard, understand their rights and access support.We want to expand this much-needed service, and are seeking enthusiastic volunteers in Scotland who can make the most of our online advocate training programme to develop their skills, gain valuable experience, and help improve the lives of vulnerable people with ME, all from home.Anyone who is interested in finding out more can call , emailor visit our website– we would love to hear from good listeners who can spare two hours a week.Alice Cranston, advocacy coordinator, Action for ME."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I’m anticipating an end to the pandemic – coming out of the gloom. And there have been many episodes in le in which I’ve lived in the hope of emerging through the other side of the dark night. I thank God for the hope he gives me. But, how do we know when the darkness of night has ended In a rabbinic school, a very old rabbi posed a clever question to his young students: #When can it be said that night truly ends and the day begins  When is that moment when from darkness there comes light, when it can really be said the gloom has passed and brightness is here #The first student, still a bit immature, replied: #Well, it’s when it says so on the internet.#The rabbi smiled and told him: #That’s not what I mean.#The next student said: #It’s when you can distinguish sheep from goats, because in the dark they look very similar, but when light appears they can be told apart.#The rabbi told him it was a wiser answer, but not the one.The third student said: #When you can tell the fig tree and palm tree apart.#This interested the rabbi, but, no, this wasn’t it. The rabbi askedthere were any other ideas, but there weren’t. So he told them the answer: #It is when you look at another person and do not see a stranger but a brother or sister this is when know the night has ended and the day begins.#Father Tony Wood, Saint Kieran#s Catholic Church, Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +viaYOURTWITTERNAMEHERE\" title\"Tweet this\"TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

After nearly a year of people taking exercise and essential journeys on foot during Covid- lockdowns, plans to keep the nation walking are more important than ever.#The increases in people walking, has highlighted the lack of good infrastructure to support safe and enjoyable travel by foot. Communities that lack local facilities within walking distance have had challenges. That’s why we are calling for investment in everyday walking to build back better after the pandemic, and respond to the challenges of air pollution, climate change and Scotland#s health record.#Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer of Paths for All, said: #We launch our manesto at a crucial point of change for Scotland as we begin to plan for le after Covid-. During lockdown, we have seen a rise in the number of people walking as many used it as a way to cope with the pressures of everyday le, to reach essential shops and services in their  area, and to connect with others and nature in a safe way.#But we need to do more to make regular walking an enjoyable and accessible choice for everyone in Scotland, from all walks of le. By investing in walking programmes and safe, attractive places to walk we can signicantly improve the nation’s health, reducing health inequalities and pressure on our NHS.#Brendan Paddy, director of Ramblers Scotland, said: #Our joint manesto makes a compelling case for investment to make walking safe and attractive for everyone in Scotland.#We believe walking can play a vital role in Scotland’s response to the challenges of Covid- and climate change # and the obesity, bioersity and mental health crises we face.

It will be aired on March  at pm.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOPressure piled on for quick Irish ferry decisionPressure was growing earlier this week on the Scottish Secretary to give Caledonian MacBrayne the go-ahead to operate the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Ballycastle in Northern Ireland.Scottish Office officials are said to oppose state-owned CalMac’s participation in the project.But earlier this week it was revealed they had asked CalMac to submit a business plan for the route. The news was welcomed by the prospective Conservative candidate for Argyll and Bute, Mr Ralph Leishman.He told the Courier: ‘This is a definite step forward and knocks on the head suggestions that the Scottish Office is totally opposed to CalMac as the operator on this route.’Scottish Office reservations are believed to centre on proposals to use the MV Claymore on the route. This would mean £, would have to be spent upgrading another vessel for relief work for its west coast services.They are also said to be concerned that no private firm appeared to be interested in running the service all year-round.CalMac’s participation in the project has been backed by politicians on both sides of the Irish Sea.Both Scottish Secretary Mr Michael Forsyth and Prime Minister Mr John Major were believed this week to have been lobbied at Westminster by CalMac’s supporters.Northern Ireland secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew is said to be among those who have contacted Mr Forsyth to support CalMac’s involvement.The project supporters have been asking the Scottish Office to consider the economic benefits the ferry could bring to Ballycastle and Campbeltown, which are both areas of high unemployment. The project is expected to create around  jobs,  of them in Argyll.The only other company which has expressed an interest in running the service, Seacat, only wants to operate it over a four-month summer season.FIFTY YEARS AGOMr Noble ill # so Provost steps in to open new airport terminalThe new passenger terminal at Machrihanish Airport will be opened on Friday at pm by Provost Dan McKinven, in the absence of Mr Michael Noble MP Minister of Trade, through illness.The new building, which has been provided by the Department of Trade and Industry in conjunction with the Ministry of Defence, is a small one situated within a self-contained enclave and is designed to improve the facilities of BEA passengers using Machrihanish.Before the terminal was built, all BEA passengers had to be taken by bus between the aircraft and the old terminal building near the main entrance of the airport, and, latterly, to a dispersal point on the south side.Under the new improvements, BEA aircraft will now taxi directly to the new terminal area, and passengers will be able to walk the short distance from the aircraft to the terminal.A new road traffic control system has also been provided because aircraft taxiing from the runway to the terminal have to cross a public road.The new arrangements have the additional advantage of reducing the distance, and, consequently, the journey time between the airport and Campbeltown.A complete shake-up of BEA Highland services is on the way. It could mean higher fares and smaller planes and the end of the name British European Airways on some routes.Last year the Highlands and Islands routes cost the company more than £,.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and FlashesThe annual meeting in connection with the Campbeltown Cottage Hospital will be held on Tuesday first at . in the Council Room.Local footballers had again an idle Saturday last week on account of bad weather. Campbeltown and Hearts will make a third attempt to meet on Saturday first, and, weather permitting, the kick-off will be at  o’clock.A favourable balance amounting to £,  shillings and d was made by Dunoon Town Council from the crops grown during last season in the Burg Parks. The income amounted to £,  shillings and d and the expenditure to £,  shillings and d.The large steam yacht Beryl, which belonged to the late Lord Inverclyde, and well-known on the Clyde, has been converted into a cable-laying steamer, and is now the property of the Commercial Cable Company, London. The vessel, which has been renamed George Ward, has left the Clyde for the Thames.The principal celebration of Burns’ anniversary in town was in the form of a concert, held in the Victoria Hall on Tuesday night, under the auspices of the local branch ILP. There was a fairly good audience, and a party of four singers and one reciter from Glasgow presented a programme that was well-received and much enjoyed.

His solution is even more batty.Driven by resentment and sepia-tinted post-Empire English nationalism, cloaked in talk of Britain and the UK, the Tories have jemmied the UK out of the world’s largest and most successful single market.Having placed the UK as a #third country# outside the EU, alongside Somalia and Kazakhstan, it is not the EU to blame for the barriers to free trade, Mr Abendroth, but the UK government and those who parroted the cruel myths of Brexiteer #sunny uplands#.Mr Abendroth suggests that the fishing industry merely sells into the domestic market as a replacement to EU trade, without thought to the timescales required to repurpose supply lines and create a viable home market # evenit could be done fishing businesses would already be bankrupt.Scotland’s economy and the living standards and opportunities of Scots have been thrown under the wheels of England’s red Brexit bus. Never have the consequences of permitting Westminster to rule our country been more stark.But the time is coming when Scotland will have the historic opportunity to regain the huge benefits of EU membership and become a normal, thriving, independent state at the heart of Europe. There is an empty seat at the top table in Europe # and it won’t be empty for long.Ron Wilson, secretary, Kintyre SNP.Remember the closing stages of the Brexit negotiations  Boris Johnson pretended he was holding out to get the best deal for fishermen. In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark – grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are – the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal ward.Keith Abendroth is spot on with his call for the fishing industry in Campbeltown to supply the home market.During my three-and-a-half years in the town it was possible to buy directly from the boat on occasion but it was nigh on impossible to buy fresh live lobster in the town#s fish shop.When I was new to the town , I experienced some shocking service at the some of the small retailers who I always endeavour to support. It is easier to get a full range of seafood and fish in Peebles, about  miles from the sea, which has an excellent fish shop supplied from Eyemouth on the East Coast.Much Welsh shellfish is sent by air to Europe. I often wondered why lorries trundled from Campbeltown across the Rest and Be Thankful and all the way to the English Channel crossings.Much of the st century supply chain is a mystery to me. For instance, much Pacic wild salmon is processed in China before being exported to the UK.  It is an excellent alternative to the farmed version at roughly the same price.Surely a town with an airport could develop a sea product freight service or is it simply down to volume, weight and cost Mark Davey, Peebles.Two weeks ago, at Campbeltown Free Church, we received a letter of thanks from Blythswood Care for filling shoeboxes to support the  Shoe Box Appeal.However, we are aware that many who contributed do not belong to Campbeltown Free Church.So, through the pages of the Courier, can I thank them for their kindness towards people they have never met but whose lives have been enriched by their generosity Dr Rodger M Crooks, Campbeltown Free Church minister.Like many, many other residents in Argyll and Bute I have received through the post a bizarre leaflet from the Liberal Democrats. Bizarre, because it promotes a candidate standing in a completely dferent seat # Caithness, Sutherland and Ross.Meanwhile, the good folk of Caithness, Sutherland and Ross have been equally mystied as to why the hapless Lib Dems have sent them leaflets promoting a candidate in Argyll and Bute!The Lib Dems have certainly lost their way when it comes to their policy on the EU # but it seems that they#ve lost their way in Scotland too.Les Wilson, Islay.Earlier this month the Prime Minister announced a third national lockdown. Although necessary, these measures mean many of our veterans will be facing the next several weeks – or months – completely alone.And while the vaccine rollout out across the country provides some hope, social isolation and loneliness poses a real threat to our elderly this winter, among them many former RAF personnel and their partners supported by the fund.To help combat this, last year the RAF Benevolent Fund introduced a weekly Check and Chat service to support members of the RAF Family experiencing loneliness. I speak to one such gentleman every Tuesday. He lives alone and spent much of  totally isolated and, for him, this service truly is a leline. We chat about what he’s been up to, what he’s cooking for tea, to his time in the RAF and often I’m the only person he will speak to for days.The fund also organises weekly telephone friendship groups, provides access to a listening and counselling service, relationship counselling support, and an online wellbeing portal to help support emotional wellbeing amongst the veteran community.Throughout the pandemic, many of us have learnt more about our neighbours and local community. That’s why we are calling on the people of Scotland to consider whether they know any RAF veterans, or their spouses or widows, who may be experiencing loneliness.To refer someone to the RAF Benevolent Fund, please visit rafbf.org or call   .Air Vice-Marshal Chris Elliot, chief executive, RAF Benevolent Fund."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 29 2021","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I cannot help but think that it bodes well for the future of that great nation to have a man of faith leading it.Returning to the words, some of the finest and most moving that day came from a young woman called Amanda Gorman.She spoke of lting the gaze of the nation not to what stands between its people, but to what stands before them, of closing ides because they know that, to put their future first, they must first put dferences aside.#The new dawn,# she said, #blooms as we free it. For there is always light,only we’re brave enough to see itonly we’re brave enough to BE it.#In the first chapter of his Gospel, John says: #The light continues to shine in the darkness and the darkness has never put it out.#We are called, all of us, to be part of that light and to be bearers of it into a dark and troubled world.

He will work with inidual police wildle liaison officers, NGOs, the Scottish Government, NatureScot, RSPB, the SSPCA and Scottish Land and Estates. The position is funded by NatureScot.PC Ross was the community police officer for Dunbar, and has  years of police service and an extensive background in wildle crime issues, community policing, problem solving and educational work.Minister for Rural Affairs and the Natural Environment Ben Macpherson MSP said: #Wildle crime is despicable and tackling it has been a long-standing priority for the Scottish Government.#We work closely with a number of agencies to ensure perpetrators are brought to justice.#The Animals and Wildle Act, which recently became law, increases the maximum penalties for the most serious wildle crimes and extends the time available to Police Scotland to investigate.#The work of the National Wildle Crime Unit is hugely valued by communities across Scotland and we are committed to supporting it. I look forward to working with PC Ross in the future and congratulate him on his new role.#PC Ross said: #When I was in Edinburgh, very early in my service, I became involved in investigating wildle crime because of my interest and experience in this area. I’ve been a part-time wildle crime officer throughout my whole service and the new job is the pinnacle of my career.#I worked very hard preparing for my interview and was very keen to secure the job, which is a dream post. I am looking forward to settling into the role and working with all the dferent partner agencies which are so important in the fight against wildle crime.#In the six weeks I’ve been in post I’ve concentrated on meeting many of the partner agencies we work with in wildle crime. Unfortunately most of the meetings have had to be done virtually, but I feel they have all been really positive and I look forward to building on these initial foundations, especially when we can meet face to face.#The head of the NWCU, Chief Inspector Hubble added: #I was extremely pleased when PC Ross was successfully appointed as our new Scottish ISO and I am sure he is going to be a valuable asset to policing wildle crime.#Andy Turner, NatureScot wildle crime officer, said: #Eliminating wildle crime is huge priority for us, which is why we’ve provided funding for this post since . Wildle crime doesn’t just cause irreparable damage to Scotland’s nature, it also affects tourism, which in turn impacts on the economy.#We are committed to working with NWCU, Police Scotland and other members of the Partnership for Action Against Wildle Crimeto tackle this challenging issue.#We worked closely with Gavin’s predecessor, Charlie Everitt, to prevent wildle crime and raise awareness. I look forward to continuing to this important work with Gavin and the NWCU in the future.#NWCU’s main role is to assist in the prevention and detection of wildle crime by obtaining and distributing information from a wide range of organisations and by helping police forces investigate wildle crimes. NWCU also produce analysis which highlights local or national threats.The appointment of PC Ross comes after the retirement of PC Charlie Everitt, who had spent the last  years developing the role of Scottish ISO within the National Wildle Crime Unit.PC Everitt furthered countless operations, provided expert advice to police wildle liaison officers and acted as the key central point of contact between the police and a vast range of partner agencies.He was well known throughout the Scottish wildle crime arena and his professional knowledge, enthusiasm, and willingness to assist were beyond question.

under the rail bridge on the townrsquos Spott Road to stop the animals from roosting there.Concerns had been raised that birds were swooping from under the bridge and startling drivers, while the animalsrsquo excrement was also creating a slip hazard on the footpath.Now, a political party and a bird control expert have called on the local authority to look again at the options available.Among those calling for a rethink is the Animal Welfare Party.Kay Hamilton, Dowager Duchess of Hamilton, is a member of AWP and said: ldquoThe birds certainly shouldnrsquot be killed.ldquoThis is ridiculous and all out of proportion.ldquoNor should the council be thinking of installing netting, as we know many birds can become trapped in netting and suffer horribly before dying.ldquoAlternative solutions

and time for us to accept that we share our spaces with wild animals, including pigeons, and humane solutions should be pursued.ldquoIt is an offence to cause unnecessary suffering to an animal, and nets cause nesting and visiting birds the most horric distress and injury before death by hanging, starvation or dehydration.Guy Merchant, of Bird Control Consultancy Services International , told the Courier that carrying out a cull would be ldquoa waste of time and money.Similarly, he suggested that putting netting under the width of the bridge could create other problems, such as trapping live birds, which could then lead to legal issues.Mr Merchant, who previously lived in East Lothian and operates his business from Cambridgeshire, said: ldquoThe very best thing you can do is mesh above the pavement area.ldquoYou completely mesh above the pavement area so you are excluding the birds from either side but leaving the central reservation open.ldquoThat means that the cost of the netting operation is dramatically reduced and, secondly,you kick all the resident birds out from the under the bridge they are going to go to peoplersquos properties in Dunbar and cause a huge nuisance.\"Mr Merchant said that left the birds to roost and perch in the central reservation of the bridge and their droppings would fall onto the road, rather than the pavement.At a meeting of Dunbar Community Council last month, it was revealed that work under the bridge was due to take place in mid-February.East Lothian Council said that the bridge was lsquohomersquo to ldquohundreds of pigeons which are

suggesting that there may be an increased risk of hospitalisation of people infected with the new iant.According to research by ONS, loss of taste and smell is less common in the new iant of Covid- -

fatigued and  per cent experienced main in the muscles.In addition, , per cent had a sore throat.This can be compared to a similar survey conducted with around , people who had the old iant, where

By not filling the holes in, they will collapse in among themselves and create a new soil structure.\"It will allow your lawn to breathe again. That job can be done pretty much any time from now up until May, when it gets too dry. You can hire a hollow tine aerator to do the job or get hold of a hand aerator which can be used on a regular basis.\"Dont fill in the holes\"A lot of people fill the holes theyve created for aeration with sand. I wouldnt do that because sand is inert - it doesnt do any good. Let the holes stay open for root development and improved drainage. You wont notice them after a few weeks, when you start to mow your grass.\"Move the goalpostsIf you have obstacles such as goalposts, trampolines or sandpits on your lawn, move themyou have space, to stop specic areas from compacting due to heavy traffic, or suffering from lack of light, he suggests.Do you need to reseed \"Scary the lawn lightly just to clean some of the dead grass out and refresh the stronger grass to recreate more growth. Ideally use a mechanical scarier,\" says Hedges-Gower. \"If you havent enough grass, you can overseed but you must create an environment to give it a good success rate.\"Pick the right seedIf youre reseeding bald patches or part of your lawn that looks a bit thin, Hedges-Gower suggests using a lawn seed mix containing ryegrass, fescue and bentgrass. But he notes you have to have the right soil conditions for any seed to be robust.Take extra measures on well-worn patches\"Ultimately,you have an area thats wearing out, its because we are walking on it and compacting it. If you cant move the goalpost or other garden toys, look at the heavy wear areas and do some more intermediate aeration on them to prevent or slow down the process of the areas wearing out,the weather suits,\" says Hedges-Gower.\"Alternatively, prick the area with a garden fork to allow the moisture to penetrate the areas to get to the roots, using the fork to about a in depth.\"Feed your lawn in spring as the nutrients from rainfall will have leached through. By May you should be reaping the benefits.\"Create a wider lawn entrance\"Remove a bit of pathway so that when you do walk on to the lawn, theres a wider area to walk on. Butyou know there are pinch points that suffer, you have to look at prevention.\"Help your lawn in autumn\"Do more to high traffic areas in autumn, which will prevent some of your problems the next spring. You may want to topdress a muddy area with sandy loam to make it less muddy in future, but you need to do that in addition to hollow tine work and aeration.\"Its all about rebalancing the growing environment. Spring and autumn are essential times to reseed. Do it as a repetition, to build the strength of your grass year on year.\"Let your grass grow longer\"The bigger cushion you can have, the stronger the plant you have and the more wear tolerance it will have, regardless of whether its a heavy wear grass or not. And feed it on a regular basis.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12279676.jpg?type=article-full","title":"coronavirus-deniers-dont-believe-covid-exists-sorry-gone-mad","story":"For many of us, braced for the next update on the death toll or front line report from an intensive care unit, it is inconceivable that people can think the pandemic is made up or exaggerated. How can anyone doubt the threat this poses, and go around feeling insouciant and safe  At a time when every shop door handle holds the menace of a grenade, such an outlook is unfathomable.Yet it is not as uncommon as you might think. Nor is it linked to intelligence or education, or lack thereof. For whatever reason, baffling though it is to those of us who trust reliable sources of information, there are countless iniduals who are adamant that Covid is either a hoax, a conspiracy, or a fuss about nothing and that the vaccines are intended to wipe us out. Behind all this lie malevolent manipulators, intent on...well, quite what they hope to achieve by terrying or killing us off remains unclear, but the fear remains potent.Astonishingly, not all Covid naysayers come to their senses when they fall victim. Last autumn, as cases in the US soared, there were reports of victims gasping for air in the emergency room, yet still insisting that Covid was fake. That really does take the breath away. ROSEMARY: In praise of JennersSomehow, though, it feels worse that anyone here could also deny it. It is not aswe live in a chaotic or rogue state, where we have been deluged in unchallenged propaganda or starved of reliable information. Nor is that information dficult to access. Indeed, one of the most miserable aspects of the past year has been the dogged coverage of escalating tragedy: footage of mortuaries filled with the dead, of serried ranks of coffins in funeral homes, of the mortally ill saying goodbye to their loved ones from behind oxygen masks.Do Covid deniers never watch, listen or read the news, or do they tune in only to what they want to believe  Certainly, down the rabbit holes of social media it is possible to find yourself in a netherworld, so far from reality you could be a character Alice in Wonderland. Except that Alice kept her wits about her, and never lost her grip on sanity.Alarmingly, as is becoming clear, the pandemic is only the latest of the fault lines opening up between people whose world views lie at opposite ends of a spectrum. We can mock thwarted Trump voters who continue to believe that the election was rigged, despite not an iota of evidence to support that conclusion. Unlike Covid, where the facts are omnipresent, the US election result has been contested without any foothold in reality. Believing the Democrats cheated says more about protestersrsquo state of mind than about what the ballot boxes contained.And yet, their certainty and grievance are real therersquos no denying that. Nor is any of us entirely immune to being manipulated by tricks or lies. You can point to the Brexiteer threats of a tsunami of immigrationwe stayed in the EU as an egregious hood, but many of those who swallowed it whole were already at a point where it merely bolstered their convictions, rather than shaped them.When it comes to medical denial, there is a long and sorry history of refusniks. Just think of John Gummer, obliging his daughter to eat a beef burger on camera to show that there was no danger of Mad Cow Disease . The government similarly played down the dangers of contracting salmonella from eggs, until Edwina Currie spoke up.The more facts and figures we are bombarded with, in our never-sleeping news cycle, the trickier it becomes to find a reasonable position between unquestioning credulity and healthy scepticism. For years it was possible to be a climate change denier, and remain intellectually credible. Now, yoursquore considered nuttyyou still donrsquot get it.What is troubling about those who refuse to believe what is happening around them, despite the evidence of their own eyes, is that it doesnrsquot make sense. It suggests wholesale disparagement, mistrust or terror of those who run the country, a determination to find hidden and sinister motives behind every announcement and regulation.Some deniers, doubtless, have no guiding principles or cosmology whatsoever, and simply prefer to ignore the wider world beyond their walls. In general, though, the level of suspicion and the passion with which untenable beliefs are held are motivated by something far stronger than lack of engagement. Discrediting Covid even when it has you in its grip denouncing global warming, despite the wildfire sweeping over your house, suggest advanced paranoia and a sense of persecution. ROSEMARY: In the footsteps of medievel pilgrimsNor is such an outlook entirely unreasonable at all times. Leadership in many countries is at worst despotic, and at the best, frequently mendacious, opaque, contradictory and evasive. Traditional media outlets deliver news that is properly researched and sourced, yet often biased in tone or emphasis. And the web is awash not just with documented fact but with misinformation that goes largely unchallenged.The fact that anyone can seriously and sustainedly deny Covidrsquos existence is merely the tip of an iceberg wersquove been trying to ignore. It is a shocking demonstration of a breakdown in societal trust and cohesion. When people refuse to acknowledge reality, and choose instead to believe what they want to believe, facts, truth, testimonies, photographic or recorded proof are cast aside as irrelevant.Despite the decline in religion in the West, maybe there is an ongoing hunger to put faith in the unprovable and intangible, an urge for creeds and a community of the likeminded based on unveriable feelings and imaginary connections. Who knows what makes people enter a parallel world to the one beneath our feet. Personally, however, I find the idea that facts and evidence no longer matter even scarier than Covid.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Its asTony Blair had sacked Gordon Brown in . It has brought to a head three isions which have shattered the unity of the Scottish National Party: the Salmond affair, the transphobia row and the lack of progress toward independence.Ms Cherry had called for Alex Salmond to be readmitted to the party after he was acquitted of all sex harassment charges last year. This did not endear her to the party leader. Next week, Mr Salmond is scheduled to give evidence to the Holyrood inquiry investigating how the Government came to lose a total of pound, fighting a doomed defence against his judicial review in . There has been a clearing of the decks in advance of this appearance, in which the former leader is expected to blow open the conspiracy he claims led to his downfall.Read more: The jury found him innocent but Alex Salmond is still on trialMs Cherry has also been an inconveniently outspoken supporter of womens rights. Indeed, she may be the first senior politician to be sacked for believing that a woman is an adult human female. She is a lesbian and a feminist who does not accept that womens sex-based rights should be sacriced on the alter of an ideology which denies that sex is binary. In short, she does not believe ldquotranswomen ARE women. For months, Ms Cherry has been the target of vilication, abuse and even death threats from numerous trans activists in and out of the party.This is such an arcane issue, baffling to the vast majority of Scottish voters, that it seems hard to believe it could have come to this. But Nicola Sturgeon has staked her reputation on driving through a new Gender Recognition Act which will allow men to self-identy, legally, as women merely by making a declaration to that effect. Last week the First Minister made a thinly-veiled attack on Ms Cherry in a video accusing her own party of transphobia. Yesterday, amendments to the much-criticised Hate Crime Bill that would have protected ldquogender-critical women like Ms Cherry from prosecution for ldquostirring up hatred were suddenly withdrawn by the Justice Secretary, Humza Yousaf.The key amendment gave freedom of speech protection to ldquodiscussion, criticism or rejection of concepts or beliefs relating to transgender identity. It also protected ldquostating that there are only two sexes and using the words ldquoman and ldquowoman to define a persons sex. The deletion of these amendments could mean that women who object to the presence of natal men in their changing rooms, or in womens sporting events, may in future be committing a criminal offence.The SNP NEC has been trying to enforce a new definition of transphobia in which even the phrase ldquoadult human female would itself be regarded as hate speech. However, it is also the dictionary definition of a woman, andquoting it is to be regarded as transphobia then there might have to be a bonfire of biology textbooks. Universities could have trouble teaching medical students about binary human reproduction.Read more: Dont tell women what makes a woman: they were born that wayMs Cherry is an experienced advocate and the best legal mind in the SNP. She took Boris Johnson to the Supreme Court in  over his prorogation of Parliament and won. In recent months she had been advocating a legal route to independence through court action on Indyref. This is a route which Ms Sturgeon has reportedly endorsed herself. So it might seem perverse to dispense with the services of the only figure in the party with the legal expertise to prosecute it. But in the SNP right now legal expertise appears to be regarded as a threat.These issues have been boiling and roiling beneath the surface of SNP politics for the last two years. The waves of scandal have been lapping around Ms Sturgeons ankles as she tries to deal with the pandemic. Now, rather like Chairman Mao in , she has decided to deal with troublesome opposition by launching a purge, and giving a green light to trans activists in her youth wing, who are highly organised on social media.There is a generational ide in the SNP. Many younger nationalists are zealous advocates of identity politics. Older, analogue politicians, like the former Justice Secretary, Kenny MacAskill tend to side with Mr Salmond and Ms Cherry. The influential Wings Over Scotland blog, penned by the Rev Stuart Campbell, which was essential reading for independence supporters in , is now calling for the resignation of Ms Sturgeon and the ldquowoke legions who are her new praetorian guard.Wings has been assisting the former British diplomat, Craig Murray, in his attempts to disclose details of the alleged conspiracy against Mr Salmond. Mr Murray is in turn defending himself against contempt of court charges relating to the Salmond trial. Another prolic SNP blogger, James Kelly of Scotland Goes Pop, has called on Mr Salmond to launch a new independence party.Like most SNP intellectuals, Mr Kelly had been arguing that it would be senseless to promote ision on the eve of a crucial election which could trigger independence. The SNP lead in the polls indicates a landslide in May. However, he now believes the situation is so dire that the two wings ndash no pun intended ndash can no longer coexist.The truth is that many in the party no longer believe that Ms Sturgeon is serious about delivering independence ndash at least not in any timescale they would regard as acceptable. Thousands have reportedly left in disgust. Ms Sturgeon dominates Scottish opinion polls and the opposition parties are disarray. Her biggest political threat now comes from within her own party.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Vessels  and , currently in some  state of unreadiness at Ferguson Marine in Port Glasgow, were supposed to address these challenges by now on the Arran and Uig-Tarbert-Lochmaddy routes.Instead, they have become symbols of what Holyroodrsquos Rural Affairs committee described as a ldquocatastrophic failure of procurement processes. The saga doubtless has a long and legalistic passage to run. Meanwhile, the islands will continue to need modern, reliable ferries.Out of this mess, it should still be possible to identy opportunity as well as catastrophe. However botched the process, too crudely tied to a short-term political imperative, the intention of building these ferries on the Clyde to save an ailing yard was honourable enough.The conclusion should not be ldquonever again so much as ldquoget it right in future. That requires a strategy rather than ad hoc actions. It needs a belief ndash self-evident where in northern Europe ndash that a nationrsquos maritime status should sustain, and be sustained by, a healthy shipbuilding sector.We will never again build great ocean liners on the Clyde but the disappearance of that tradition has been translated too easily into the shorthand that ldquoshipbuilding is finished, apart from the BAe yards tied to Ministry of Defence orders, which are secure for the next  years.But need it be like this  As the Holyrood committeersquos report put it: ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos approach to the procurement and construction of new vessels hellip has been short-term, piecemeal and lacking in strategic direction. Change that state of affairs and a lot of opportunities arise ndash and they extend beyond CalMac ferries.It is at least possible that Brexit creates that opening. For decades, membership of the EU was blamed for our inability to use public procurement as a means of supporting our own basic industries, and none more so than shipbuilding. If that can be changed, then let us have the good grace to recognise it.From my own experience, I think the EU was more an excuse than a reason. In the CalMac case, there was a long-term civil service agenda in Edinburgh to fragment and privatise. This eventually led to the separation of infrastructure and operations, the theory being that any operator could then compete to use ferries and piers.I remember discussing this with the most senior relevant official in Brussels who insisted the Commission was not interested in Scottish ferry services but ldquo something is waved under our nose often enough we have to do something about it. So the split was created between an infrastructure companyand the operators, who have ndash despite the theology of the issue ndash continued to be CalMac.Now we are outside the EU, I would scrap CMAL and replace it with an agency with a wider remit to use public procurement to the maximum advantage of the Scottish shipbuilding and marine engineering sector ndash with the prize of industrial revival and skilled jobs in parts of Scotland, particularly the Clyde, that desperately need them.A ldquowhite paper on this theme, produced by the Glasgow-based Malin Group, estimates close on a billion pounds worth of vessels are in the Scottish public sector pipeline not just CalMac but local authority ferries, fisheries protection, Northern Lighthouse Board and so on. But how much will stay in Scotland  On current form, very little.Public procurement, their report concluded, is ldquothe essential foundation for reviving civil shipbuilding on the Clyde with all available facilities brought into play to provide the flexibility that proved to be lacking at the Ferguson yard alone.Add in the requirements of aquaculture and renewable energy, which can certainly be guided by Scottish Government policies and requirements, and the potential order book for a Scottish shipbuilding revival becomes even more promising. It is an exciting vision.However, it certainly will not happen without firm policy leadership and co-ordination. If all these public sector bodies continue to do their own thing, the opportunity will be lost. We will still be building ferries in Germany and Denmark while the industrial work-boats float over from Holland.There is responsibility too on the UK Government to make this possible. How are the terms of Brexit going to be interpreted  Are there to be new freedoms to use public procurement as the key to industrial regeneration  Andnot, then what is the point It is a classic example of why the two Governments need to work together towards a shared objective. Potential positives for the Scottish economy should not be shunned just because they can, in part at least, be attributed to leaving the EU. There are plenty disadvantages, so we might as well have some advantages also.None of this ignores the need for home-based industries to be competitive. In the longer-term, it may be unsustainable to force public bodies to pay more for vessels that could be procured from where in Europe as has become the norm. But there should surely be an opportunity to put that to the test.Scottish public procurement as the basis of a Scottish shipbuilding revival.

Are we expected to conclude that this in some way has a bearing on the case for or against independence  Is the implication that Scots, as a nation, are intellectually deficient compared to their southern neighbours and would be incapable, regardless of their political allegiances, of electing a competent Government in an independent nation  Or is it another example of the myth peddled by unionists that an independent Scotland would be a one-party state governed in perpetuity by the SNP The competence or otherwise of inidual politicians or political parties has no bearing on the democratic deficit so clearly summed up on these pages by Ruth Marrwho described Scotland as a nation held prisoner the overwhelming numerical facts mean that the cell key will always be held by voters south of the Border.Finally, as an aside and as a member of the over- cohort, I would add that very few acquaintances of my generation have expressed any dissatisfaction with their own vaccination experience.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.BREXIT AND THE PANDEMICWHILE I understand the concerns of John Dunlopregarding the need for constitutional change during a pandemic, I also have concerns. In spite of the pandemic, the UK Government pursued Brexit. This was the greatest change to the UK constitution in  years. It was not prepared to extend negotiations until such time as the pandemic was over. The UK Government demonstrated perfectly to the SNP that it is possible to carry out constitutional change during a pandemic.Duncan Stirling, Cardross.* SOMEONE called Alister Jack has been popping up in The Herald in recent days. Perhaps you could advise us who he is, what he does and whether you have spelt his name correctly.Jim Crawford, Wemyss Bay.ADVICE IS NOT IMPARTIALIAN GRAYadvises Douglas Cowe, who was looking for impartial facts and advice on independence, that he should simply read Business for Scotlands book Scotland the Brief to get all the information he needs in it he would find \"surprising, interesting, enjoyable, credible, informed opinion that would open his eyes and educate him\".What Mr Gray did not tell Mr Cowe was that Business for Scotland was founded by six business people who support Scottish independence and that Business for Scotland was registered with the Electoral Commission as a \"permitted participant \" on the Yes side in the Scottish  Scottish independence referendum.Business for Scotland also received a pound, donation from Stagecoach founder Sir Brian Souter.Very often its what youre not told that is most revealing.Its maybe not the \"impartial advice\" Mr Cowe was after.Allan Thompson, Bearsden.INQUIRY DISGRACEIT seems that Peter Murrell, the SNPrsquos CEO and husband of Nicola Sturgeon, has refused to make a further appearance in front of the Salmond inquiry at Holyrood, in spite of having been requested by the inquirys committee toto clary apparent inconsistencies in his previous testimony . Is this to be tolerated  Can a witness simply pick and choose whether he will attend There is something very rotten at the heart of this matter, and it is time that either the committee was given full powers to compel witnesses to attend and provide answers to questions or  the entire shebang was handed over to a properly-constituted judicial inquiry, with full judicial powers to compel witnesses to attend and to answer questions, on pain of judicial sanctions. The way this affair has been conducted suggests that the people in charge of its constitution are treating us all aswe button up the back.Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh EH.WAS JOHNSON PANICKING CHRISTOPHER H Jonesseems to believe that the Scottish Governments proposal to freeze council tax for a year is politically motivated, while at the same time persuading himself that the sole purpose of Boris Johnsons visit to Scotland last week was to \"support our wonderful scientists, NHS workers and the Army\".Instead, during a day when he ignored his own oft-repeated injunction to \"stay at home\", Mr Johnson spent time keeping key staff off their work, travelling  miles from his home and, quite possibly, risking spreading the virus. The real reason for the visit, I am convinced, was the onset of panic at the string of Scottish poll results showing a majority for independence.As for Mr Joness advice to pensioners to \"squirrel plenty of money away\" to pay for future council tax rises, I would ask Mr. Jones: what with Alison Lambie, Stirling.SPINNING OVER THE VACCINESJANE Laxhas fallen for the UK Governmentrsquos spin over Covid jags, as England has similar problems over supplies.On January , NHS England advised that all care home residents and staff would receive their first jag by  January ldquoat the latest but letters only went out last week. At the weekend several leading care home operators in England complained that only around a half of residents had been vaccinated due to a shortage of supplies.England also experienced the same problems over Sunday vaccinations, as the UK administered , doses on Saturday, January  but only managed around half as many the following day.Extrapolating from the Scottish data that the UK Government tried to suppress, the UK may be administering vaccines at around half the pace it receives supply, yet the same UK Government and the unionist parties are spinning and politicising the vaccine roll-out in Scotland.This of course has been taken up by the media, including the BBC, yet they steadfastly refuse to publish the easily-available comparable number of cases and mortality rates in the four home nations as this shows Scotland in a much better light thanks to the tireless efforts of our NHS staff and Nicola Sturgeonrsquos clear leadership.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh EH.PENALISED FOR SHIELDINGMY we and I are both  and I must confess I am bemused by the logic behind the vaccination programme in our health board area.The s and s have been vaccinated by our hard-working GPs in a local centre set up within the village a few minutes walk away. My we and several of our friends neighbours of a similar age received their letters on January  inviting them for vaccination on February  at the town hall of the adjacent town some three miles away, not a problem. Being previously placed in the shielding category and thus considered \"extremely clinically vulnerable\", I received my vaccination invitation on February  for an appointment on February  at a centre set up in another town eight miles distant. Therefore being placed in the vulnerable group has resulted in my having to wait longer and travel further than would have been the case had I been left in my age group cohort.I am in the fortunate position of being able to drive.

Private companies ask customers to be patient with staff who are operating from a working from home situation, but no similar allowance is given to teachers or pupils who have had to constantly change to the new circumstances. In addition, teachers are also dealing with their own work-from-home lives, which may include home schooling their own children. They have adapted lesson plans while simultaneously teaching, and were given notice by the Scottish Government only days before the school term was due to finish before Christmas about the sudden change in circumstances. They support children and young people by creating normality and routine to help protect their mental health against a backdrop of uncertainty and change.There must be consideration for the stress on children of learning from home, feeling overwhelmed by the volume of work. Itrsquos unrealistic to expect children to deliver a normal level of productivity when theyrsquore isolated from their peers. I know several parents who are struggling to keep their children motivated piling on school work adds to that stress for both and may result in more of these children falling further behind. There needs to be greater appreciation of the mental health impact of children to concentrate for long periods in these conditions.As a parent of a Lenzie Academy pupil, I donrsquot recognise the complaints and can only speak well of their approach. A letter was sent on January  to parents outlining the blended learning plan. The school gave adequate explanation regarding this. Through online s the teachers provide reassurance to pupils with live drop-in sessions and support and frequent pastoral care through guidance and assembly sessions.Ultimately the focus should be the quality of the work rather than the quantity.

We are about to move to Lanarkshire, where the figures show a worryingly long wait for treatment .At the beginning of April  after feeling unwell I suddenly dropped unconscious to the stone-tiled kitchen floor. An ECG reported atrial fibrillation. Two months later the cardiology specialist suggested I may have sick sinus syndrome where the heart pauses and may or may not restart.Four months on from my initial event, frustrated and very anxious awaiting further investigation, I posted a statement on the Care Opinion website. A consultant cardiologist contacted me and set up a treatment plan which involved having a cardiac monitor implanted in my chest. This monitor confirmed a few months later that indeed my heart was having short pauses and the treatment required was a pacemaker.Irsquom alive and well at present but things could have been dferentI had not had the motivation and the ability to seek help.How many people have had to wait for treatment to save their le because of a lack of funding to provide more doctors, nurses and facilities to treat cardiac disease Margaret Edwards, Bridge of Allan.WHERE ARE THEY ALL GOING WE are being encouraged to stay at home and only travel for essential purposes.

First: the expertsare going to be subject to what is now known as The Govian Response, or ldquoWhat do experts know anyway  The report will also be subject to the Look Over There! Response, which involves ignoring the central conclusions by talking about something  instead.This, in effect, is what Fiona Hyslop, the Scottish Governmentrsquos Economy Secretary, did when she was presented with the findings. ldquoAs an independent member of the EU, she said, ldquofree from the damage of Brexit, Scotland would be part of the huge single market, which is seven times the size of the UK.But that completely ignores what the LSE report actually said ndash what they call the independence paradox. No one denies that Scotland,it rejoined the EU, would be part of a huge single market, but what Ms Hyslop ignores is that the EU is a much less important trade partner for Scotland than the rest of the UK and would remain so for a long time to come, even after rejoining the EU. MARK SMITH: The dilemma every unionist is about to encounterIt is this fact that sets up the paradox. Yes, rejoining the EU as an independent country would boost trade with the EU, but it would also lead to an increase in trade costs with the rest of the UK. What this means is that, in order for Scotland to be better off inside the EU, independence would have to destroy a sufficiently large share of our trade with the rest of the UK to make the EU Scotlandrsquos most important partner. This is the paradox: for joining the EU to be economically desirable, independence would have to damage our current economy.Sadly, a lot of that would happen naturally, which is the other part of the report that jumps out at you. When neighbouring countries, or regions, or countries in a close union, set up borders between each other, trade between the two starts to decline big time and this is what would inevitably happen to Scotland for reasons that arenrsquot just economic. Look at this bit of the report: ldquoborder costs result not only from economic policies, such as tarfs, but also from cultural and social dferences between nations that reduce the effectiveness of international communication or lead consumers to prefer domestically produced goods and services. MARK SMITH:Why support for independence is up hellip and the three groups of voters who are still resistant to YesThe logic of that is undeniable ndash you put up a fence, itrsquos harder to talk to the guy on the other side and miscommunication develops. The bit about consumers preferring domestically produced goods and services is also disturbing, isnrsquot it  I can see it now: ldquoBuy Scottish! ldquoBuy English! And the English would have much less to lose ndash trade between RUK and Scotland accounts for .% of RUK output compared to % of Scottish output.The SNP would saythat the lost trade with the rest of the UK would be made up by increased trade with the EU ndash just as Brexiteers said lost trade with Europe would be made up by trade with the rest of the world. But the LSE report makes the reality of that clear: the rest of the UK would remain our biggest trading partner for a long time to come, except that, under independence, the trade would be in terminal decline.In a way, I think thatrsquos the hidden sadness of this new report. No doubt, some of the economic damage of independence would be countered by increased trade with the EU, but those cultural, social and personal dferences the report mentions are a dferent matter altogether.

February , with some S- students set to go back on a parttime basis for the completion of essential practical tasks.Mr Swinney has since claried that the First Minister was referring to activities such as woodwork.It is hoped P- youngsters, as well as those in early learning and childcare, will be able tofull-time from the same date.Final decisions are to be confirmed in two weeksrsquo time and will depend on continued progress in suppressing Covid-.Most learning and teaching is taking place remotely, with schools closed to all except key worker and vulnerable children.On Wednesday, in a sign of potential flexibility around the new measures, Mr Swinney did not rule out re-opening classrooms to senior phase pupils with no home internet so they can complete vital coursework.Asked for his views on the possibility by Conservative MSP Oliver Mundell, Mr Swinney said: ldquoI think itrsquos a reasonable proposition.Amid fears over unequal access to digital technology and broadband connectivity, the Education Secretary also praised the resourcefulness displayed by schools in reaching out to pupils during lockdown.The Perthshire North MSP highlighted the example of youngsters in his own constituency who have been able to obtain learning resources in local convenience stores.ldquoI think we have to have scope in our consideration to address some of these legitimate practical challenges that might exist for young people to engage in their learning, he said during a meeting of Holyroodrsquos Education and Skills Committee.ldquoIf a young person was struggling in relation to digital access, perhaps through connectivity challenges in a particular locality, schools have been resourced and supported to enable them to address that in other ways.ldquoSo while it is desirable to have that digital connectivity, itrsquos not the only means by which learning can be undertaken.ldquoI see a lot of other examples around the country where schools are making available access to materials and to educational resources through the school, by collection, or by access to local shops in dferent villages.ldquoIn my constituency, educational materials for secondary schools that cover a number of dferent towns and villages are available in convenience stores in dferent parts of the community.ldquoSo schools are really thinking through: how do they reach young people  How do they engage them in their learning Education Secretary John Swinney.His remarks come amid ongoing concern over iation in access to online teaching across Scotland.The Herald told at the end of last month how there had been calls for remote learning to be subject to set standards after it was revealed only one in three local authorities indicated that lessons were being provided at all their schools on a daily basis.And in East Dunbartonshire alone, investigations were launched after angry parents lodged complaints that the online teaching time which does exist ies between over  minutes and a structured four-and-a-half hours per day.Guidance on remote learning from standards watchdog Education Scotland states children and young people are ldquoentitled to ldquoa balance of live learning and independent activity.Of  Scottish councils which responded to questions about the extent of daily live online lessons, just nine indicated that all schools were providing them.Parent representatives have indicated the availability of in-school classes during lockdown should be determined in part by a pupilrsquos ability to learn remotely.Eileen Prior, executive director of parentsrsquo organisation Connect, said: ldquoWe have been asking for children and young people who are unable to be do schoolwork at home, for whatever reason, including those unable to access digital learning for whatever reason, to be recognised as lsquovulnerablersquo.ldquoThere is an acute education deficit for young people in this situation, which in many cases will be the most

If Scotland gets to low numbers, we should protect Scotland from importation.#If the UK gets to low numbers, we should protect the UK from importation andwe can get both islands and our surrounding islands to low numbers, we should protect that whole five countries and we should do that using vaccination, restrictions to our population and importation restrictions.”Responding to Professor Leitch’s comments, Mr McArthur said: “Where there are low levels of virus, we should be doing everything possible to keep it that way. The Northern Isles continue to see a lower prevalence compared to the Scottish mainland, and it is in everyone’s interest to keep it that way.“I have been making the case for testing ahead of travel to the islands for weeks now. So far Ministers have confirmed that the case is being considered, but no firm conclusions reached.“Professor Leitch’s intervention today strengthens that case but also reinforces the importance of putting in place appropriate protections.“I know ongoing discussions are taking place with the island authorities on a range of dferent issues. However, Scottish Ministers now need to set out how they see testing at ports and airports to work in practice.“We all want to see restrictions eased as quickly as possible but this needs to be done safely and with a continued focus on protecting the public.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, it’s been particularly dficult for those in the islands given broadband constraints and the fact that more parents are expected to work since we’re in a Level Three area.“While everyone is clearly adapting and doing the best they can, the obvious benefits to young people of being at school, both in terms of their learning and social interactions, cannot be overstated.  Indeed, in her statement to parliament this week, the First insisted the government would use ‘every inch of headroom’ available to them to get children back to school safely.“On that basis, it seems logical to look seriously at the possibility of applying a more localised approach to the reopening of schools.“I appreciate that there will be many factors to be taken into account, but I welcome the Education Secretary’s recognition of the case for a more ‘tailored’ approach, where this can be done safely.

This will be used until a full restoration of the new cable can be completed.In addition, new overhead lines will be constructed. This follows around seven kilometres of lines being removed following the successful installation of the new cable.An SSEN spokeswoman said: “Following positive test results, plans are now being progressed to temporarily reconnect the cable until full restoration of the new cable is complete.#This includes the construction of .km of overhead line between the old and new subsea landing points in Hoy. SSEN is currently reviewing construction timescales but expects short-term works to be complete by late February , subject to suitable weather conditions.”The spokeswoman added: “There will be some restriction to electricity generation export during the period of the fault. SSEN remains committed to engaging with all generators connected to Orkney’s Active Network Management system to manage any generation constraint that may be required and will look to minimise disruption wherever possible.“SSEN will provide regular progress updates to stakeholders throughout the period of the fault.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the islands, Highland and rural areas and villages across the country, BBs and self-catering properties are often the only tourism accommodation, and the spend by their guests supports these fragile economies.“The business owners on today’s webinar were understandably very concerned that the poorly-drafted ‘Short-Term Lets’ licensing legislation would be hugely onerous to microbusinesses in Skye and right across Scotland and would be a catastrophic ‘double whammy’ after these very same, small family businesses have been so disproportionately hit by Covid-.”SkyeConnect maintain that the fees for licensing accommodation with the council could be as high as £, per business. that the process to determine the fees has not been completed, and urged those affected to respond to the Parliamentary consultation before the cut-off date of this Friday. The draft regulations, published just before Christmas, will then be considered by the Local Government and Communities Committee.A spokeswoman added: “The fees are not proposed to be the subject of a statutory instrument but instead are at the discretion of each local authority to set. However, the fees must be set to ensure they are sufficient to cover the local authority’s administrative expenses.“In order to calculate this, it requires work to be carried out with our finance department as to the cost of processing and determining a licence taking into account income vs expenditure. It also requires to take into account the cost of resourcing the new licensing regime including factors such as recruiting additional staff, building and IT costs.“In terms of setting dfering levels of fees, this also needs to be assessed based on whether the processing of these applications will take longer, ie be more costly to administer.“This is an ongoing exercise and ultimately cannot be completed until the draft Regulations are finalised and we know for certain what types of letting premises will or will not be included within the licensing regime. Once this is known, it will require a paper to go to the Licensing Committee on the setting of fees for their determination.” she had “raised the concerns of constituents# with the Housing Minister Kevin Stewart. She also stressed the importance of responding to the consultation.She added: “I fully understand the concern of those across Skye and Lochalsh. In particular, I realise that the tourism industry has been through the most awful time. To that end, the deadlines associated with this have been extended to April  so that the sector has some breathing space. The purpose of the licensing scheme is a set of mandatory standards which apply to all short-term lets and I imagine that the vast majority of hosts already comply with all of these standards – and more.”A working group is currently being established to develop guidance, she said, and there will “definitely be a representative from the BB sector, as well as self-catering to “influence, inform and shape” that guidance.She also maintained that the Scottish BB Association responded to both Scottish Government consultations on the issue, in  and , and were “clear that they were in favour of levelling the playing field between BBs and properties listed on s such as Airbnb.”Ms Forbes added: “In terms of fees, there has been much concern about fees of several thousand points. The Scottish Government has not specied the specic fee level that local authorities should charge, and there is scope for local authorities to consider setting dferent fees for dferent types of short-term lets.“As the MSP for Skye and Lochalsh I will ensure that the concerns of SkyeConnect and others are passed on to those steering the legislation through parliament.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CARBOST-SHOP-1.jpg","title":"community purchase secures future for carbost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe project was delayed due to the first covid lockdown and since then the Carbost Community Shop Community Interest Company has been working hard to organise the legal side of the purchase.: “We are so pleased that everything has gone through at last and the current owner, Sharon Thacker, has been so supportive and patient during the whole process.

Officials recommended approval.A motion tabled by Skye councillor John Gordon to reject the application was seconded and supported by Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and fellow Skye councillor Calum MacLeod. It was defeated by eight votes to six.A statement on behalf of a number of Stein locals opposed to the Morgans’ development said: “Obviously, the community is shocked and deeply disappointed at the decision made at planning committee yesterday.“It is widely felt that what we are seeing is the result of a planning system that is broken. A system that has lost all integrity of intention and total collapse in community trust and respect. Everyone is talking about it.“It would seem, that a system of double standards exists, where one set of rules apply to the long-standing residents and a dferent set for the speculative, corporate developer who demonstrates no understanding interest or empathy for local heritage or the community they impose their developments on.“The progress of this application through planning has totally failed to uphold the objective of the conservation area and fails to recognise the importance of the setting of the listed building. Neither does it take account of the numerous natural heritage and wildle issues raised.”Approving the application “makes a mockery of the term conservation area and neither does the proposal comply with the terms” of Highland Council’s own local plan, the statement said.It added: “From the moment this application, with very signicant potential for detrimental impact, was accepted into the system amidst the strictest part of the pandemic lockdown, it has been felt that it sought to subvert the right of the local community to fair comment.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/James-Rebanks-and-dogs-credit-Andrew-Heading-edited.jpg","title":"we can learn a lot from old henry of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineHis debut book, ‘It’s A Shepherd’s Le’ — which I stumbled on by accident— went on to become a best-seller.It’s a wonderfully evocative account of the massive challenges and privilege of being a hill farmer in the fells of the Lake District.Like all good writing, it doesn’t feel like reading you are just taken on an effortless journey of the imagination.I’ve never been to the Lake District myself, but from all accounts it’s quite spectacular — a bit like our own Highlands — and Rebanks captures that vividly.But what comes across more than anything is the sense of privilege he feels from being connected to the land, the massive challenges of trying to make a living from a harsh environment and his profound sadness that a way of le which was once the bedrock of rural communities is now fast disappearing. The parallels to our own circumstances is quite striking.His second offering, ‘English Pastoral’, offers a bit more optimism. Once again it’s a tremendously easy read and we are back on the fells, among the distinctive Herdwick sheep, the cattle, the characters — in particular his grandfather whose farm he inherited —and the drystone dykes. Except this time we are offered a lesson, and it is one that should make us sit up and take notice.Through charting the history of his home valley, Rebanks shows how agricultural practices have changed over the course of time and goes on to explain how similar trends have taken place throughout the UK and, indeed, across the globe.After the Second World War, governments rigorously pursued policies of producing more and more food. Farmers were offered huge subsidies and incentives, so farms became bigger, semi unproductive land improved through mechanisation and modern practices, and on and on the juggernaut ploughed.Then came the supermarkets. Their over-riding aim was to drive down prices, so farms had to become more efficient. Economies of scale became the mantra. Traditional family farms disappeared, swallowed up by larger businesses, machines became bigger and more expensive and farmers became captains of industry and capitalists.None of this happened overnight, of course, but it is heartbreaking to read of the struggles of the Rebanks’ own traditional family farm, trying to stay afloat financially while competing with the drive for modernisation going on all around them. The le of a hill farmer —or crofter for that matter — can seem romantic, but the reality is often very dferent.Eventually, Rebanks’ father had an epiphany – and it was something that the younger ones had also realised. And it was all to do with ‘Old Henry’.Old Henry was a neighbouring farmer, an eccentric bachelor. As all those around him invested in new machinery and chemical fertilisers, Old Henry never bothered, or even seemed to care.He just continued in his own stubborn way, farming the way it had been done for generations with native breeds of livestock, cutting hay well into the autumn , thistle and weeds adorning every nook and cranny and his old stone barns more a haven for birdle than serving any useful practical purpose.Rebanks always used to take more than a passing glance at this farm. With its vast array of wildle and ancient practices, it reminded him of the way his grandfather’s farm used to be.When Old Henry passed away, the inevitable happened and the farm was broken up and sold to larger businesses. The agronomists came with their scientic degrees to survey the land and assess what inputs were required to transform this antiquated model into profitable production. Their conclusion astounded them: never before had they seen soil so healthy. It required not a jot of chemical input.And here’s the crux of the lesson: Old Henry was onto something, whether knowingly or not. And the Rebanks were to take heed.Over the course of time, as the drive for greater efficiency became ever more necessary, farmers began to specialise in one or maybe two products – whether that was focusing on huge livestock numbers or on a particular crop. Traditional mixed rotation became a thing of the past. It was seen as unnecessary, as chemical fertilisers and pesticides could ensure continued productivity and profitability.But, through time, it all led, perhaps inevitably, to the destruction of the soil and natural environment. The evidence was there all along, but perhaps no-one had the time or inclination to see. The farmland birds — the curlew, the lapwing, the corncrake — were disappearing the earthworms, such a crucial indicator of soil health, non-existent. ‘Modernisation’ had come at a very heavy price indeed.And so the Rebanks family began to reassess. Fast-forward to today and their family hill farm now derives part of its income from subsidies geared towards environmental improvement: from the hedgerows planted, the trees, the fenced off waterways, from ious bits of wildle havens dotted around the farm.But, be under no mistake, this is still very much a working livestock business, just that the main enterprise is now dove-tailed with nature and bioersity, just as it once was through natural occurrence back in his grandfather’s day.There is a growing realisation that this is the way forward for agriculture and land use – and might even be a way of getting the wider populace to warmly embrace the countryside once again.Due to simple economics and geography, a lot of the ‘modernisation’ of which the book speaks passed crofting by, so who knows maybe we could be in the vanguard of this new agricultural and land-use enlightenment – given the proper vision and the right political will, of course.As Old Henry of the fells so ably demonstrated in his own idiosyncratic way, there’s a lot to be said for the old ways. Maybe it is time to re-connect with the past."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/363-Katherine-Dix-Ceit-at-spinning-wheel-outside-Nissen-Cottage-from-Alison-Dix-daughter-via-EM.jpg","title":"traditional journey of the swelling","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSometimes we can follow the journey of a specic story by comparing earlier texts from the great collections of the th century with later recordings, especially those in the School of Scottish Studies archives available online at the digital archive Tobar an Dualchais. We catch characters, plots and inidual episodes changing to reflect new environments, audiences and times as each version is transported by the carrying stream.How a story changes informs us about the people who tell them – their culture, beliefs, and worldview. A setting may be changed to make a story more appealing to a local audience. An episode may be omitted because it isn’t seen to be relevant – or because it is too sensitive. The same story may be repeated because it is an effective warning: be wary of the wilderness lying beyond our township’s boundary.With the help of Tobar an Dualchais, we can follow one story’s journey from Highland moor to the island of Hearmatraigh, near North Uist, in real-time. Folklorists call this kind of story a migratory legend: where the same type of story is told in dferent areas, but with dferent settings and characters, localised where it is told.Catherine Dix, or Ceit an Tàilleir, was a remarkable storyteller who contributed hundreds of items to the School of Scottish Studies Archives. Born in , Ceit spent her early le in Beàrnaraigh, before moving away for work on the mainland at the age of . After a prolonged time away, she ed with her family to the island at the start of World War Two. She was recorded extensively during the s and s.One traditional story features a shepherd and his dog who stay in a shieling overnight. A hag arrives to warm herself by the fire. She swells to the size of a peat-stack, remarking that it’s only her ‘plumage’ rising with the heat. The hag attacks the shepherd but is driven away by the dog. The story is often called ‘m’ iteagan is m’ oiteagan’ : the phrase appears in most iants of this tale.Ceit recorded the story on at least three occasions in  , and with Iain Paterson , himself a native of Beàrnaraigh employed as a collector for the School of Scottish Studies. The  recording is transcribed in the excellent  publication by Ceit’s granddaughter, Alison – Ceit an Tàilleir.Ceit clearly enjoyed telling the story, but during a decade of performances it changed its setting: from a nondescript Highland moor in , to an unnamed island in , and finally to Hearmatraigh in . A story, originally set on the mainland, is gradually reworked by the storyteller, perhaps to make it more appealing to an island audience.It’s in the nature of migratory legends to change – it’s what makes it easier for them to migrate in the first place. But can we also trace where the story came from  Where did Ceit first hear her story: in Beàrnaraigh, or where Folklore recorders are trained to ask about where tradition comes from. At the end of every story, Iain Paterson would ask Ceit where she heard the story. In , she mentioned her father, Archibald Macleodfrom Baile Mhàrtainn in North Uist. But in the  recording she offered an extra explanation: the story in fact came from Archie MacColl of Ardtur in Appin, where she worked on a farm between the ages of  and  years. Paterson, clearly intrigued, asks how the story came to be set in Hearmatraigh. Ceit replied that Archie MacColl had heard the story from a boy from the Outer Hebrides who was working for him.It’s interesting that Ceit maintained here that the story was set in Hearmatraigh in both versions she heard – the one from her father and the one she heard as a teenager working in Appin. In her first recording she had set the tale in the Highlands.By comparing this story and its episodes to similar ‘migratory legends’, we can try to trace how it might have spread. The villain of Ceit’s story is the ‘swelling hag’. This redoubtable character is met with in a type of traditional story that once was told across Eurasia. It is known by folklorists as ‘The Two Brothers’.In the Scottish Gàidhealtachd, we have a version of ‘The Two Brothers’ recorded in Beàrnaraigh. It is called ‘Cailleach na Riobaig’and was collected in  for John Francis Campbell’s ‘Popular Tales of the West Highlands’ project. Despite similar wording between the two tales, Ceit’s story contains episodes not present in the  tale, episodes resembling other versions of the story collected on the mainland, east of Appin.On the whole, Ceit’s story is more similar to these mainland versions than anything recorded in the Outer Hebrides. Although she told Iain Paterson in  that both versions of the story she had heard were set in Hearmatraigh, it may be that, to make the story more attractive to an island audience, Ceit deliberately relocated an originally mainland story to the Sound of Harris. This comes through in the changing setting of her three versions of the story.But why Hearmatraigh  In relocating her story, Ceit chose a location which preserved the kind of setting in the original mainland story. She keeps the shieling, an outpost of civilisation in the wilderness where many stories tell of conflicts between human society and the supernatural.Hearmatraigh might have been chosen as it was one of the principal islands where Beàrnaraigh folk would stay in shielings for short periods to hunt, fish, and harvest peat. One recording on Tobar an Dualchaisnotes that the bothy on Hearmatraigh was built using lime-mortar: this construction technique would have made it stand out among other island shielings built of stone and turf.The Hearmatraigh settlement was centred around the natural harbour known as An Acairseid Mhòr. It is very likely that the fishing station from the time of Charles I mentioned by the Hebridean author Martin Martinwas located here. Could the fishing station’s ruin have been later repurposed as a shieling It may be, then, that when Ceit was looking for a local setting for the story she had originally heard in Appin, moving the tale to Hearmatraigh made it more relevant and appealing to her listeners. But with this clever transfer she also skilfully preserved the cultural signicance of its original moorland setting: a place out in the wilderness where dangerous supernatural creatures could overwhelm the unwary.Ceit Dix’s stories demonstrate the richness and iety of Gaelic traditional culture and offer a glimpse of how skilled storytellers adapt and localise their tales to entertain and intrigue their dferent audiences. contains some , oral recordings of songs, music, poetry and factual information made in Scotland and further afield."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3602630.jpg--.jpg?1612358530000\n","title":"great donation from vincent and his band of kitchen quizzers","story":"‘VINCENT’S Kitchen Quizzes’ has raised over pound for Northern Ireland Hospice .Vincent Rainey, the man behind the ongoing and highly popular general knowledge testing sessions, recently presented a cheque for pound to Emma Henry, a volunteer from the Ballymena Hospice Support Group.In an effort to ease boredom and raise spirits in these unprecedented times Vincent has been running quizzes every weekend since March last year.

There is a carefully rehearsed procedure of name taking, mask changing and hand sanitising at the initial entry point where these vital duties are among the many roles taken up by volunteers such as Arthur Halligey who was the first greeter on Friday morning.Arthur, part of the Volunteer Now group, is just one of an army of citizens doing their best to help out with the operation and their dedication and community spirit has been hailed as vital by Sinead OKane, Assistant Director of Governance and Risk Management - essentially the woman who is charged with keeping the process running smoothly.A good description for Sinead would be a cocktail of irrepressible energy mixed with an indefatigable sense of humour.Sinead is obviously very serious about her role and she has her fair share of stories about her experiences during the course of the pandemic, but when this grim periodfades sooner rather than later, Ill take a bet that her motivational skills will live long in the memory of all those she has worked with.And like all good leaders, she knows the worth of all those around her who have thrown their energies into the process.IN IT TOGETHERSineads team really does bring meaning to that somewhat cliched phrase of were all in it together - in their case it has never been more important to be all in.From the start this has been a massive logistical operation with literally every department doing their umost to provide this service.I cannot speak highly enough of these people. Everyone - volunteers, the administrative staff and of course the nurses, midwives, Allied Health Professionals and NIAS and support services have really been all hands to the pumps , she says.The timetable for vaccinations is, of neccessity, honed down to a fine art. We estimate that from entry to exit, the process lasts around  minutes - and half of that is spent seated post-jab as a precaution on carefully cleaned chairs adjacent to the exit where recipients receive their final documentation.Behind the scenes, the flow of the all important vaccine is controlled by a team of pharmacists under Deputy Head of Pharmacy for the Trust, Stephanie Tohill, who reiterates Sineads words on the united effort.I’ve got the greatest respect for everyone involved, she says. Hard to believe weve been doing this for six weeks and we have a long way to go as we move through the ious age groups.So what does this monumental operation come down to  Saving lives is the very obvious answer. Protecting health and social care services is another major factor.But Sinead, in typical fashion, boils it all down to one word - people.Im sometimes almost overwhelmed by the reactions we get from the people who pass through. “They are so kind with their words and their support.The one incident that really sticks in my mind is a conversation I had with a gentleman on palliative care who received his vaccination.He looked at me and thanked us all, saying this means I dont have to die alone. That hit hard.But then she added with typical humour: In fact he ended up having to console me!In a pandemic riddled with cliches theres one that holds very true. If you didnt laugh, youd cry.Lets all hope that the efforts of all those behind the operation at the Seven Towers Leisure Centre bring some much needed fun and laughter into all our lives.

It was a sad time but after a lot of Bible reading and reflection I came up with the idea of trying to help others in some small way.And since then, the Harryville woman has held fast to that idea based on her Christian faith.HUMBLEDDoreen says she has been humbled by some of the experiences she has enjoyed as a result - especially at Christmas time when the seat is laid out with ious toys.There are people out there with children who dont have enough money to buy the things they want to give. Some have fallen on hard times through unemployment or just find that their budget for daily living is just too tight.From my point of view, Im blessed to be able to do just a little bit to follow the teachings of our Lord and I get my reward when sometimes I get to see the miracle of happiness on a few little faces, she added.And Doreens favourite story about her summer seat is associated with a little boy who was walking past her house one Christmas with his father.The child spotted the toys on the seat and the pair stopped to look.I just happened to be looking out and saw them standing at the wall. I knew they were feeling awkward so I went out and explained why the toys were there. The man told me that he had lost his job and money was pretty tight so I asked the childhe wanted any of the items.The wee fella chose a toy car - just a wee cheap thing - and he seemed pleased. He told me really wanted a set of roller blades for Christmas but I could tell from the fathers face that the cash wasnt there to pay for such things. Off they went and I never thought much about it until a few days later I came out of the house to find a set of roller blades on the seat.That can happen from time to time. People leave stuff knowing it will go to someone who needs it. Other people send me parcels of things to set out and Id like to thank all those who do so.When I saw the roller blades I was amazed and I was even more amazed when the man came up to the house that day and told me that something had spurred him to come by.I pointed at the roller blades and the look on that mans face was wonderful to see. I believe it was the Lord working in mysterious ways and for me that is the best reward, says Doreen.You can join Doreen and her son David, a near neighbour, on a regular basis as they enjoy fellowship and a wee Gospel song or two on Facebook Live.

Skerry Road East, perhaps the least busy road in Northern Ireland, is part of the Dungonnell Trail but it also runs past the evidence of this area’s industrial past.If you’ve ever driven out of Cargan and on towards Cushendall and Waterfoot you will have seen the signs of railway lines in the valley below.The article below, which sets this story in context, first appeared in its entirety in The Glynns Volume and is currently hosted online via the website of the Glens of Antrim Historical Society. It is drawn from the ‘Iron Mines of Glenravel’ by Kevin J. O’Hagan“Within the last two years an extensive and valuable iron mine was discovered at Glenravil about  miles from Ballymena by James Fisher Esq. of Cleggan Lodge near this town and of Barrow-in-Furness, Lancashire. Under the energetic management of this enterprising gentleman it was opened about  months ago.”So read the editorial of the Ballymena Observer, Saturday, July th, , commemorating the opening of the first of the Glenravel iron ore mines.Just three weeks earlier Mr. Fisher himself had given an open-air party for about fty gentlemen friends on the mountainside near the mine. It was an unusual repast, but no more unusual than the event it commemorated for here, in one of the bleakest, most barren and out-of-the-way places in the country, rich seams of iron ore had been found and mud-stained miners were raising  tons of top quality ore per week.This situation could hardly have been envisaged a few years earlier, not even by Fisher. Others before him were aware of the existence of iron-bearing rock but failed to exploit it or to locate the richer seams.The first had been Nicholas Crommelin, who, in , in his task of settling the area and building the village which bears his name, found a sample of the ore.He had it analysed by Professor John F. Hodges who found it to contain from  to % peroxide of iron. Crommelin’s enthusiasm got the better of him and he set about building a furnace to smelt the ore using the local peat for firing.He made repeated attempts to smelt the ore and succeeded in obtaining some metallic iron but the dficulties were so great that he abandoned the idea altogether.His furnace still stands near the village of Newtowncrommelin, a monument to his endeavours.Some years later Hodges was again called to examine some specimens in the possession of Edward Benn, the Glenravel landlord.These were obviously much richer specimens than Crommelin’s for Hodges was now convinced that valuable deposits lay hidden in the Glenravel mountains.Benn had his ore smelted by a local smith, John McAlister of Legegrane, who managed to produce a small sample of iron.This was then taken to Rowan’s foundry in Belfast where it was mistakenly identied as having been produced from the best Swedish ore.This was praise indeed but it seems strange that Benn himself took his discovery no further.Perhaps he was deterred by the failure of ious other projects with which he was connected — the distillation of alcohol and the distillation of paraffin — and was reluctant to invest money in any new venture.At any rate, it wasn’t until the arrival of James Fisher on the scene that mining the ore became a serious proposition.Credit for the initiation of the successful exploitation of the mineral wealth of this area is traditionally given to the parish priest of the time, Rev. Wm. John Macauley. He was a keen rambler and interested in geology and he was aware that the home-based linen industry, by which the majority of his parishioners lived, was in decline owing to the rise of the large spinning mills.His parish included the Braid and no doubt because of this he became acquainted with James Fisher who was then residing at Cleggan House, the property of Lord O’Neill.When a parishioner showed Father Macauley a piece of red rock he had found, Mr. Fisher was immediately contacted for Fisher already had mining interests in N. W. England, an iron ore producing region.The pair of them then set off on an exploration trip to Ballynahavla, near Cargan accompanied by two other men, one of whom had found the ore in the first place.They went almost directly to the spot and lting back a piece of overhanging turf discovered a seam two feet thick. They at once proceeded to Glenravel House to see Edward Benn who encouraged them to investigate further and gave Fisher permission to dig for a year at a rent of pound. The stage was thus set for one of the greatest industrial booms of the century which was to last nearly  years.In  Fisher began by outcrop digging or opencast mining at a place known as the Gullets, on the slopes of Slievenanee, and in the first six months was able to ship , tons of ore to England worth about pound per ton. It was not long, however, before he realised that more and better ore lay within the outcrop and he began to drive adits.The first underground mine to be opened was aptly named the Glenravel mine, situated in the townland of Legegrane on the south slope of Slievenanee.This was in January . Soon, other enterprising gentlemen began to take note, among them Silas Evans who laid the foundations of the Antrim Iron Ore Company which quickly took up large parcels of the country.There was a great influx of people into the area and several mining villages sprang up, chief among them Fisherstown, named after James Fisher, but now with the uninteresting name of Cargan.The ordinary farm workers of the area took to the novel type of employment and soon acquired the new skills of mining.Wages of  - per week in  rose in  to  - and  - per week for underground workers and to  - and  - per week for surface workers. By  there were about  men employed directly in the mines and  horses were being used in carting away the ore. To facilitate this Fisher had built his own tramway which ran from the Gullets to Parkmore, a distance of two miles.There was as yet no narrow-gauge railway from Ballymena.Most of the miners were labourers and small farmers and the owner of a small farm could even do part-time work at the mines when farming conditions permitted.This helped to supplement his farm income. This new-found source of wealth led to a rather unruly sort of le and drinking sprees and brawls were common.Fisherstown was so wild that children were not allowed on the street when the miners were in town — a situation more akin to the Wild West in the goldrush days.At the start of mining operations levels were driven generally two or three at a time. A connecting passage was then cut to join these levels together to provide a cir-culation of air to the miners and to disperse explosive fumes.From this stage the mine was extended horizontally generally following the ore seam and this gave rise to the term — the Longwall method — literally along the wall of the passage. As soon as a sound roof was met with, side roads were driven right and left and from these the working areas branched off approximately  yards apart. In these areas the miner excavated the ore with a pick and shovel in a cramped and awkward position lying on his side. He removed the ore and waste rock in a wide circular sweep andthe roof was thought to be unstable or unsafe he left pillars of rock standing to support it. This method of mining was known as the ‘room and pillar’ and many examples of it are still visible today in these mines.Probably early in the process rails were laid into the mine to provide a means of removing the waste rock as well as the ore. For this reason the main adit was driven  feet high by  feet wide to accommodate a double line of rails. Alternatively,a single line was considered sufficient or the level was for ventilation only, e.g. an air drt, it was driven only  feet wide. As the workings progressed the waste rock within the mine was used to block off workings which became exhausted or to support the roof in place of the ore which had been removed.The miners worked on a sht system so that they would not be mining ore all day.This meant that they worked half the day in the mine digging ore and the other half on the surface loading it or doing some other job. They would be replaced at the ore face by other miners who had been on the surface during the morning sht.The hours in the Glenravel mines were  a.m. to  p.m. By the early ’s several mines were being worked — Fisher at Slievenanee, the Crommelin Mining Co. at Tuftarney, the Antrim Iron Ore Co. at Cargan and Dungonnell and Mr. Charles Chambers and the Evisnacrow Iron Co. at Evishnacrow. Mining had also extended to other areas, namely Parkmore, Glenarf, Rathkenny, Carncormick and Broughshane.Up to this time the mines had been worked solely for iron ore. Aluminium was still a virtually unknown commodity and it was only in  that it was realised it could be obtained from bauxite.In fact, these minerals, aluminium and iron, are two of the most common elements of the Earth’s crust between them making up nearly % of the total composition. It is no coincidence, therefore, that the ores of these metals, bauxite and iron ore, formed by the prolonged weathering of basalt lavas, are found side by side in the Antrim hills.It was Professor Hodges again who, probably because of his familiarity with the ores of the district, discovered bauxite in the Cargan Mine in .This discovery added more interest and potential to the mining industry and boosted out-put from the mines for several years. During these years too the narrow-gauge railway had arrived, reaching Cargan in May  and Retreat in October . Branch lines were laid to the ious groups of mines and these facilitated the ore being removed quickly from the mines to Ballymena and thence to Larne for shipment.The Wire Tramway, an overhead bucket system built in  for transporting the ore from Cargan to Red Bay, had come and gone, having been sabotaged on the night of Sunday, July th  and never repaired. Nevertheless, mining then even as today was dependant on an efficient means of getting ore away quickly. The railway encouraged expansion in the mining industry and made the ore more valuable because it was more accessible.However, in the early ’s, due to a slump in the iron industry in Britain and the exhaustion of the better-classores, production started to dwindle. The production of bauxite continued and some mines went over completely to the mining of bauxite e.g. Tuftarney and Evishnacrow mines, the latter being worked up to . Iron ore production carried on at a reduced pace in most of the mines and towards the turn of the century the Crommelin company even opened a series of new mines along the east side of the Skerry Water and two bauxite mines on the west side.In general, however, the number of working adits steadily declined and desperate ef-forts were sometimes called for to prolong mining, e.g. at the Cargan Mine where numerous volcanic dykes displaced the ore seam, the miners had to bore their way through  feet of solid rock in an attempt to locate the seam but had to give up. Three of the five adits were soon to be closed but in , in attempting to reopen one of them, an additional problem was encountered for the mine was by this time flooded.In , a prophetic writer, R. A. Watson, in an article in the Dublin University Magazine, made the comment that it would take some hundreds of years before these ore deposits would become exhausted, but sadly prophesy and actuality are seldom one and the same. All mining enterprises have to be abandoned sooner or later either because the deposits are exhausted or their extraction no longer pays. Mining, therefore, must eventually disappear from any area since it is only a temporary form of occupation. It is a natural progression. It took Nature millions of years to produce these minerals and what the miners removed in a few short decades cannot be replaced.The mines eventually closed and no one is really to blame. Various factors contributed to the decline, one of the main ones being the unfavourable dip of the ore seam which often caused flooding.Fisher’s mines, the original Glenravel Mines closed on --  because the best quality ore had been worked out and the second quality was considered uneconomical to work. Adits  and  of the Evisnacrow Mines were last worked on -- and closed because of the company’s inability to work them at a profit.The British Portland Cement Manufacturing Co. took over the bauxite mine here in  but the bauxite proved unsuitable for their purpose and the mine was abandoned on --. The Dungonnell Mines were subject to flooding but they were abandoned in  because of disagreements between the mining company and the leaseholders. The Crommelin Co. too was plagued by flooding problems as well as the ore failing but still managed to excavate an exten-sive series of workings at Skerry East, many of which are still accessible.Quite apart from these reasons there are three other factors which contributed to the closure of the mines.Firstly, there were no smelters in Co. Antrim and the ore had to be shipped to mainland Britain.Secondly, the quality of the iron ore was not good enough for smelting on its own — it had to be mixed in the furnaces with other richer, imported ores. The bauxite, too, was not entirely suitable for the manufacture of aluminium and only a small proportion was used for this purpose. Imported bauxite was cheaper and more suitable and so the demand for Antrim bauxite declined.Thirdly, the high cost of transport from the mines to the smelters and processing plants left little profit for the mining companies.Although the mining industry in Glenravel appeared to have died prematurely it was not forgotten. With the outbreak of World War Two a new crisis loomed in the shape of U-boats and it became increasingly dficult to obtain foreign bauxite.In  Lord Beaverbrook announced to the nation that there was a scarcity of aluminium, and aluminium was a vital ingredient in the manufacture of war planes.By this time Germany was producing about % more aluminium than the USA because of her control of Aluminium-producing countries. So it was that interest in the Antrim bauxites was rekindled and this led to re-investigation of local reserves. In  new bauxite mines were opened at Newtowncrommelin known as the Skerry Mines.Other abandoned workings were reopened for their bauxite content and many Glenravel miners and sons of miners were recruited to work in the new mines. Many travelled daily to work in the vast labyrinth at Lyle’s Hill, Templepatrick.The Skerry Mines closed early in  and mining as an industry finally ceased on --.

The marriage took place in  at Full Sutton Prison while they were serving terms in separate prisons in England, both convicted of being involved in IRA bombing campaigns on the UK mainland.Mr Kavanagh had also previously served as special adviser to former Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness.In  he won compensation after losing his role as a special adviser after a bill drafted by TUV leader Jim Allister prevented anyone with a criminal record from holding the position.At the time Mr Kavanagh said the Bill victimised former prisoners, especially members of Sinn Fein.“Twenty years into a peace process and the victimisation goes on and we’re still going to exclude people ” he said.“Exclusion was part of the problem that we had and why we ended up in conflict. Is the message out there, that’s what we’re going back to, exclusion.“I worked in the community and voluntary sector for seven years before coming to the Assembly, working with some of the most deprived communities, trying to help build a better society.“Ex-prisoners are saying to me `why are we being victimised’ ”In making the announcement of new EA membership, the Department of Education said: “Mr Kavanagh brings to the board of the EA experience of communication and influencing skills, developing and maintaining co-operative working relationships within a corporate governance framework and analytical ability and decision making as a school Governor.“He has experience of budgetary management in an organisational environment.“Mr Kavanagh has declared that during the last five years he has undertaken political activity for Sinn Fein and canvassed on behalf of the party, or helped at elections.”TUV leader Jim Allister said the appointment sends a dreadful message to a new generation of children.DUP East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell said there would be anger at Sinn Fein’s decision to nominate the convicted bomber.A Sinn Fein spokesperson said: “Paul Kavanagh has a wealth of experience in education, government and policy development.”A spokesperson for the Department of Education said: “Under the Education Act ,  board members are appointed directly by the Department of Education with the remaining  Board members appointed directly by political parties in accordance with the D’Hondt principles.“Under this legislation, political members are not ministerial appointments and as such the Minister and Department have no role in the nomination process.“The Minister is informed by the relevant political party that the member is in post, having confirmed to the Department that they wish to take up office following nomination in accordance with Schedule , Paragraph .”Some parents at Lumen Christi College were angered when Mr Kavanagh was proposed as a member of the Board of Governors at the Londonderry School in , a position he has held for the last nine years.At the time of his appointment to the Board of Governors at Lumen Christie College, Sinn Fein said Mr Kavanagh had made a signicant contribution to his community over many years.“This has included spending over four years as a governor of a local school in Derry,” the party said.“Republican ex-prisoners have played a signicant role in the development of the peace process and in community development work within the areas where they live.“Those involved in this work should be encouraged not demonised.”Two other people were killed by the IRA unit in which Mr Kavanagh was a member.Nora Field and John Breslin were civilians caught up in the explosion at the headquarters of the Irish Guards, in October .Also nominated for EA positions by Sinn Fein were Angela Mervyn, currently employed by the West Belfast Partnership Board in the role of Education Programmes Manager and Frank Maskey, recently retired as Principal of Corpus Christi College.Gillian McGrath, recently retired Director of Education in the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, was nominated by the NI Commission for Catholic Education to represent the interests of trustees of maintained schools.The Board is made up of  members, some nominated by political parties. The EA is responsible for the delivery of education services throughout Northern Ireland.Belfast Top VideosVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny McCleanVideo#Deliberate# car fire ends with person in hospitalVideoExclusive Belfastpoll: DUP support takes a e in wake of Irish Sea border rowMost ReadSF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub Our family will not stop in our fight for justice, vows daughter of murdered Danny McCleanDissident Danny McClean murdered in Belfast had spent five years in British ArmyNI teen who wouldn#t stop singingFields of Athenry to police fined £ and told to learn whole songEast Belfast show of strength #an attack on the Ogle family#Latest EducationNI students to get £ Covid- paymentNI student medics to miss out on £k Covid recognition bonus given to health service trainees Dodds to meet Irish education minister over NI students taking part in ErasmusMinister Weir accused of #hissy fit# over Welsh exam board decision affectiing Northern Ireland pupilsLatest from Belfast Biden ending US support for Saudi-led offensive in YemenTwo men arrested over north Belfast murderCustomers# savings of £bn will help to kick-start Northern Ireland economy: bankLiverpool not allowed to play Champions League tie against RB Leipzig in GermanyTwo men arrested by police investigating murder of Danny McClean in north Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

benefit from the payment Mark BainTwitterEmailFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailAlmost , students at university or in full time education in Northern Ireland will receive a one off £ payment to mitigate against the disruption caused by Covid-.The scheme will cost £ million and students have been told they can expect payment before the end of March.The NI Executive agreed the proposal from Economy Minister Diane Dodds on Thursday, the funding coming from a wider package of £.m in support£.m is included in the package announced on Tuesday by Finance Minister Conor Murphy for students facing particular hardshipMrs Dodds said she was “acutely aware” students have experienced signicant disruption since the start of the pandemic.“I am pleased to announce that I have secured £million from the Executive to fund a one-off discretionary payment of £ to all students from the UK and EU who are in full time higher education in Northern Ireland, whether that is in a university or further education college setting,” she said.The majority of students in universities and further education are taking their courses online due to the pandemic and many have been left facing bills for rent for accommodation they have not been able to live in.Support was also announced to address digital poverty, the provision of safe working, learning and research environments, as well as compensation for universities for a loss in income through rental pauses and releasing students from accommodation contracts.Students have also faced losing jobs and have been unable to find, work to supplement their income from student loans due business closures during extended periods of lockdown.Ellen Fearon, president of the student body NUS-USI, said it was a welcome announcement after a dficult year for students.“So many students have endured financial stress, isolation, academic pressures, housing problems, additional caring responsibilities and digital inequality,” she said.“Now it’s important that students who are not eligible for this grant, including part-time students and international students, are also financially supported.Queen’s University President and Vice-Chancellor Prof Ian Greer said the measure will “bolster the range of interventions” already made by the university, including “pausing accommodation contracts”.Prof Paul Bartholomew, Vice-Chancellor at Ulster University, said the institution “will work closely with the department to distribute these additional funds to our students as soon as possible”.Education Minister Peter Weir has called on Ulster University to follow the lead of Queen’s by ending rental contracts for students unable to stay on site.Belfast Top VideosVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny

Some researchers have linked this to the failure of governments to adequately fund social care.If we do not have a system which provides appropriate care for our very oldest citizens, then we cannot expect le expectancy to keep increasing at pace.We have seen this failed policy reveal its full potential for harm in the death rates amongst care home residents during the pandemic in NI. We did not adequately protect our older people from Covid- by failing to provide PPE to their carers and by allowing the UK Government to become overly focused on #protecting the NHS# at the cost of care homes and carers.The figures suggest there is also a poverty gap.

Before the UK left the EU, Johnsons of Whixley sold £, of plants to Northern Ireland customers every year.The company said new and impractical restrictions had hampered long-standing trading relationships.Plants which originate from a bare root young plant, or those that have had any contact with the soil, evencontainer grown, are considered a risk because of the likely legacy of soil residue, which has the potential to carry pathogens or nematodes, Johnsons said.While not impossible, soil residue removal is impractical and would defeat the point of rootballing and containerisation.Long-standing customers of Johnsons and many other nurseries are left with no choice but to go directly to EU suppliers because there are no restrictions on legacy soil residue between EU members or affiliates in the guise of Northern Ireland. Johnsons head of production and procurement Jonathan Whittemore said: This legislation penalises UK growers and gives an immediate competitive advantage to EU suppliers, who may go on to monopolise supply into an existing part of the UK at the expense of our business and the wider industry.Belfast Top VideosVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny McCleanVideo#Deliberate# car fire ends with person in hospitalVideoHealth Minister says more than , vaccines administeredMost ReadSF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub Dissident Danny McClean murdered in Belfast had spent five years in British ArmyNI teen who wouldn#t stop singingFields of Athenry to police fined £ and told to learn whole songOur family will not stop in our fight for justice, vows daughter of murdered Danny McCleanEast Belfast show of strength #an attack on the Ogle family#Latest Northern IrelandTwo men arrested by police investigating murder of Danny McClean in north Belfast PSNI seize drugs and cash in suspected criminality probe linked to East Belfast UVFMental health experts braced for #avalanche of trauma# in our kidsPSNI carry out #evidence gathering operation# at west Belfast funeralDerry virus tragedy couple Barney and Sarah McGlinchey died holding hands, says daughter Latest from Belfast Liverpool not allowed to play Champions League tie against RB Leipzig in GermanyTwo men arrested by police investigating murder of Danny McClean in north Belfast PSNI seize drugs and cash in suspected criminality probe linked to East Belfast UVFMental health experts braced for #avalanche of trauma# in our kidsRob Delaney recalls car crash that led to him going sober,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Western Trust received £, from his efforts and the Southern Trust received £,. What a treasure he was. It is disappointing and I know other people who would call themselves nationalists or republicans actually did pay tribute.He added: They [SF] probably had their own reasons for doing it.During the meeting, Ulster Unionist councillor Victor Warrington said: The man was a great inspiration at the start of this pandemic, with his efforts of doing the walk to raise millions for the NHS. He had a great le of  years and would have had some great stories to tell.

He said: We all now have the opportunity to show our appreciation for him and all that he stood for and believed in. That is why I encourage everyone to join in a national clap for Captain Tom and all those health workers for whom he raised money at pm this evening. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Captain Tom#s contribution - having raised more than £m for the NHS during the first coronavirus lockdown - will be formally marked, possibly with a statue.Belfast Top VideosVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny McCleanVideo#Deliberate# car fire ends with person in hospitalVideoHealth Minister says more than , vaccines administeredMost ReadSF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub Dissident Danny McClean murdered in Belfast had spent five years in British ArmyNI teen who wouldn#t stop singingFields of Athenry to police fined £ and told to learn whole songOur family will not stop in our fight for justice, vows daughter of murdered Danny McCleanEast Belfast show of strength #an attack on the Ogle family#Latest Northern IrelandTwo men arrested by police investigating murder of Danny McClean in north Belfast PSNI seize drugs and cash in suspected criminality probe linked to East Belfast UVFMental health experts braced for #avalanche of trauma# in our kidsNI women likely to live four years more than men: studyPSNI carry out #evidence gathering operation# at west Belfast funeralLatest from Belfast Liverpool not allowed to play Champions League tie against RB Leipzig in GermanyTwo men arrested by police investigating murder of Danny McClean in north Belfast PSNI seize drugs and cash in suspected criminality probe linked to East Belfast UVFMental health experts braced for #avalanche of trauma# in our kidsNI women likely to live four years more than men: study,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The site has lain empty since  but in recent days trees and weeds that had grown over time were removed. A planning application was previously lodged for the construction of  residential apartments which will comprise of  one bed and  two bed apartments.

If approved, people will be able to gain access to the apartments from Foyle Roadand John Street.  There will also be a ground floor parking area that can accommodate  cars. The accommodation is viewed as a good location for non-car use and car ownership will be being actively discouraged at the site. A Travel Plan will be promoted by a ‘Travel Coordinator’ who will promote other forms of transport. A document accompanying the application, states: “The measures will encourage the use of sustainable modes, reduce dependence on the car and therefore contribute to reduced car growth in car journeys, increase the use of healthier alternatives such as walking and cycling, and contributing towards making a safer, healthier environment around the development.” googletag.cmd.push A report also highlights the servicing arrangements for the building which sits close to the bottom deck of the Craigavon Bridge. It identies the challenges posed by vehicles collecting or delivering goods to the apartments but deems these activities to be ‘low-impact’, aside from removal vehicles, which was categorised as ‘medium impact’ – but something that will happen ‘once a year’. The site was formerly occupied by Hamilton  Sons factory which was demolished in . At the time there were concerns about the stability of the building, which had been derelict for years. Foyle Civic Trust was disappointed by the decision, saying that everything should be done to save the industrial heritage of the city.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The boat, named Day Dawn N , ran ashore on August  last year and has remained anchored to the spot ever since. The retired fishing vessel had been acquired by Nathan Ross and Druso Martinez de Riquelme with a view to mooring it at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast as an Air B ‘n’ B. However, after running into dficulty last August, those plans have been put on hold. It was initially suspected that the tide was too low to refloat the boat. googletag.cmd.push However, the owners later revealed that the bigger issue was the fact that it’s suspended over a three and a half metre crater in the mudflats. In late November, the stars seemed to align to the sailors’ delight a high tide arrived and they secured the services of marine specialists to dig a channel under the boat in order to move it to a nearby marina. The drones were out to capture the moment Day Dawn made it back to sea. Unfortunately, their efforts proved unfruitful and, according to the owners, the operation cost a substantial sum of money. There has been little to no activity around the boat since the start of this year. googletag.cmd.push The Derry News asked Foyle Portthere will come a time when it may have to intervene orit’s possible the boat could become a permanent fixture on the River Foyle landscape. In response, a spokesperson said: “The responsibility for the movement of the boat remains firmly with the owners and we would encourage them to continue to do all they can to have the vessel re-floated. “This is an unfortunate situation that they have created and now must make every effort to employ further resources to deal with this problem. “We continue to monitor the location to ensure that the vessel poses no threat to the main navigation channel, nor that it is causing any unnecessary impact to the local environment.”     The boat owners were contacted for comment but none was provided at the time of publishing.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The mural at Great James Street was created by local company UV Arts. Ahead of the broadcast of the new ITV programme Home Sweet Home, which will feature Derry in an episode airing on Tuesday, February , it has been revealed that the mural was suggested by Joanna Lumley, the show’s presenter. Ms Lumley visited Derry in  to take part in a conference marking the th anniversary of Children in Crossfire, the charity set up by Mr Moore. She ed last autumn to film for the series in which she visits places special to her. googletag.cmd.push Ms Lumley said: “In Derry we wanted to film the historic murals, The Derry Girls and my friend Richard Moore, the ‘Derry Lama’, as the Dalai Lama calls him. “It suddenly seemed that we could link these three stories together by art: the ravishing mural Saoirse-Monica showed me of the Derry Girls led us easily to Karl, whose team is creating such important new art work in this fabulous city. “Would it be possible to celebrate the le-affirming achievements of the man the Dalai Lama calls ‘My hero’ in a mural  “The finished work is utterly magnicent, and I am proud that I was allowed to spray a tiny bit of it under Karl’s watchful eye. Part of me will always remain in Derry, a city I love with all my heart.” googletag.cmd.push  Mr Moore said: “When Joanna told me towards the end of our recording that we had one more stop to make, I could not have ever imagined what I was about to be shown. “I am so honoured and humbled at this wonderfully generous gesture. Joanna has been a good friend to me and a great supporter of Children in Crossfire, both of which mean a great deal to me. “She has also built a great rapport with Derry and many of its people, and I look forward to tuning in to Home Sweet Home to see our city at its best.     “I am also grateful to Karl Porter from UV Arts for his vision and genuine passion for this project”. Karl Porter from UV Arts, the creative arts team behind a whole host of public artworks in the city and the artist who painted the mural, said: “Its not everyday you get to paint a mural with Joanna Lumley, who is apparently very afraid of heights and I was told she will not get on the lt, but she did! “ “Joanna helped me direct the cherry picker and also painted one of the most important parts of the mural - the connection, the area where The Dalai Lama and Richard Moore touched. “I think the symbolism of this helps strengthen the relationship and the meaning behind the mural. “The mural depicts a Buddhist blessing, a signicant moment between His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Richard Moore. “The Unalome symbol rising from that connection is the Buddhist symbol representing the path to enlightenment. “Our journey in le is never perfect, never straight or even in the right direction but a journey nonetheless, full of lessons and experiences. Something that Richard has lived experience of, having overcome such a powerful injury to lead a wholesome and selfless le dedicated to others.” Karl said that when first approached about the project he was delighted to have the chance to celebrate one of Derrys greatest living heroes. “The chance to create our own connections led us to collaborate with Belfast based artist and illustrator Conor McClure and together create this powerful piece of art. “If you look closely, the shape of the heads and the Dalai Lamas embrace - forms the shape of a heart, a simple yet subtle way to celebrate the connections between these two iniduals. “It was a great privilege for me to be asked to produce this new mural. The image we have used is iconic, showing the Dalai Lama’s deep spirituality as well as his admiration for Richard Moore. I hope it will attract locals and visitors alike for many years to come and a poignant new addition to our street art movement in the city.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The plans involved the construction of  houses at a riverside site at Rossbay off the Limavady Road. Residents in the area had raised a large number of concerns in relation to the plans, including road safety and congestion issues. The plans were first submitted to Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning department in . They involved the proposed construction of  houses and eight bungalows on the land overlooking the River Foyle. After detailed examinations, the councils planning department recommended that the plans be approved. googletag.cmd.push However, the final say on planning applications rests with councillors on the councils Planning Committee. The committee held its monthly meeting today and there was a y discussion on the plans for the Rossbay site. Representatives for local residents opposed to the development and the company behind the housing plans were given the opportunity to address the meeting. The meeting was told that although  objections had been received in relation to the plans, they involved multiple submissions from  properties in the surrounding area. This was the largest number of objections that the council has ever received in relation to a planning application. googletag.cmd.push After the ious arguments were put forward at todays meeting, DUP councillor Hilary McClintock proposed that the committee go against the recommendation of the councils planning department and refuse permission for the Waterside development. Her proposal was seconded by SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins and supported unanimously by all the councillors who were eligible to vote at the meeting. If so wished, the developer can now appeal the councils decision through the Planning Appeals Commission.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A report carried out by council officials has estimated that the required repairs at the building would cost pound,. googletag.cmd.push The report said that pound, of that money would have to be spent on replacing the swimming pools filtration system and other pipe work. An estimated pound, would be spent on removing and replacing the external plastering on the William Street building. A further pound, would have to be spent on upgrading the internal walls. According to the council report, pound, would be the cost of painting the building, internally and externally. The report stated that the City Baths, which has been home to the City of Derry Swimming Club for many years, would have to be closed for nine months to allow the repair works to be carried out. googletag.cmd.push The report was discussed in confidential business at the councils monthly meeting last week.

The Waterside was without a GAA club to call its own for  long years before the first Pearses team was put together back on January , , and from that day, the club has endured. So much has happened – for Club Chairman Thomas McNaught most of it has passed in a blur – but for all the highs and lows experienced over two decades, what matters most is the future. The club have a new ground to call their own, right at the top of Corrody Road, and after years of hard work and persistence, they expect to play their first games on it some time this year. Covid- prevented the grad unveiling last September, but everything is in place and as soon as some semblance of normality s to the sporting world in the city, those gates will be opened and a sea of youngsters, in green and red, will take their first steps as the next generation of this proud club. googletag.cmd.push For McNaught, it is a far cry from where it all started. “It is a big milestone. Sometimes you thought you were never going to get there at the start,” he said. “The first  years were the longest but the last  years have flown in. If I think back on it, the first  years felt like  years but the last  years didn’t exist,you now what I mean. It just disappeared year after year, probably because we went from Seniors, Minors and Us right down to Primary Schools now. “There are far more people involved there are hundreds of wains running about now. I think we had  underage last year, of all ages, and that’s including girls as well. We started a girls’ team last year as well.” googletag.cmd.push The presence of a club in the Waterside cannot be underestimated, the desire for Gaelic Games in that area of the city always evident. McNaught and those who have come along on this journey could not have foreseen such success when they started, after years of doing bus runs to Creggan with young gaels. “You don’t even think of those things when you do start out,” he agreed. “I was the first manager of the first senior team and you can’t think about  years down the line. There was the nucleus of a team there at the start but they were all very young. There wouldn’t have been many over  or , it would mainly have been teenagers and to tell you the truth there’s about  of them still there, the likes of Eoghan Carlin, Cormac his brother and boys like that who are still about the club.     “Paddy McNaught and Eddie Nash would have taken wains over to Dolans and their U team was one from the Waterside apart from two or three from the Derry side. It just went from there because there was enough players for a team and we decided then to go on our own because we didn’t need people to go over to Dolan’s then because we could make do ourselves.”  Field of Dreams For years Doire Trasna could be found on the pitches at Lisnagelvin, their unofficial home of sorts, but never the ideal solution. It was always a case of waiting, working and believing that one day their own ‘Field of Dreams’ would materialize. That day has now arrived. “When we first started we were playing out in Prehen but then we got up to Lisnagelvin and that was a big help to us,” Thomas continues. “Even though it wasn’t our own pitch, it was still in our own community and that focus area. Getting to play in Celtic Park was a novelty for the young ones and that spurred them on even more. “Everybody will tell you that once you get your own grounds, that’s really the start of it and you should go on from there and go bigger because it is a main focus. That will be a big help towards pushing it on and we would like to thank Fr. Michael Canny for his help in that” Pearses have been able to enjoy some memorable successes along the way, winning their first Junior Championship in , before winning their first League and Junior Championship double in , a precursor to getting to the Ulster Junior semi-final where they agonisingly lost to Belnaleck -, - under long term manager Paul Simpson. If they hadn’t seen such riches they could live with being poor. “It’s a passion,” Thomas states. “There are no paid workers so everybody does it for the love of it, and that’s the main thing. I always say that you have to breed gaelic players, you don’t find them. You take it our first crop of young boys who started out, their wains are now playing for us, so that’s the sort of the direction gaelic goes in. “Us having coaches in the Primary Schools has really built up the numbers and brought the wains to it, probably wains whose parents didn’t think about Gaelic, but once they started playing it and they seen the enjoyment they got out of it, that really helped. “At the start there would have been plenty of sleepless nights over whether you had a team or not the next day, but we always did. Sometimes we went out thinking we would beat the easier teams only to lose and then in games when we thought we would be hammered, we would win. At the start the better the opponent the better we played, but when it came to a dogfight, we didn’t know how to handle it. “There were definitely sleepless nights, but at the end of the day you get up the next day and the world’s still turning and you just get used to that.  New committee The club recently held its AGM and announced a new committee comprising of  dferent positions within the club. Pearses are the latest in the city to find their new home, following in the likes of Doire Colmcille and Sean Dolan’s in showing real progress on that front in recent times. GAA in the city is in such a healthy place at the minute. “If you are walking down the street and you look around, you’ll see a lot of GAA tops, should it be Derry tops or Dolan’s tops or Ardmore or Colmcille or Steelstown or even Culmore,” Thomas continues. “Culmore is another team and they are starting out with  year-olds so they have a big mountain to climb and fair play to them. You can see that it’s changing and it’s no longer just a soccer city. “In the past there were plenty of people in the committee who were doing four or five jobs, but now there’s one person for ever position which is a big help and which makes it easier. The wains are coming through, knowing there’s a big pitch there and they are going to meet friends and make friends for le.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I’m always going to be the same person, but there’s definitely more weight on my shoulders, maybe more for the younger boys coming through who might look up to me, so I have to make sure I’m doing everything right and that I’m as professional as I can.

Mr Fitzsimons is well-known for his walking tours in this area.ldquoI came up with the idea of doing the coastal path and following the pilgrim path to the holy well, he said.ldquoThe reason we did that was because of the outstanding natural beauty that is there. It is a really undiscovered kind of gem in the whole of the island in terms of the natural beauty.As part of the filming, Duane met the former president and Ciara for a picnic and a chat. ldquoWe staged the picnic at Ballyhornan with an upturned boat and our lunch on top of it, he explained.He added that it was a delight to meet the former president.ldquoMary McAleese was really quite personable and willing to get to know a bit about me and also about the whole area.The programmes takes guests to dferent locations in Ireland to talk about their spiritual journey through le.It is the second film in the current series to showcase the beauty of the Co Down countryside.The first film aired last month and featured the former president with Dundrum-born comedian Patrick Kielty on a walk through St Patrickrsquos Way in the Mournes.Mr Kielty was asked about his faith in God and replied: ldquoIf you are not going to believe in God walking up the Mourne Mountains, when are you going to believe in Him Former Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has also taken part in the series this year.

A number of residents were also forced to leave their homes.The mortar was discovered at the side of a busy road close to the entrance to Tievenadarragh Wood and after it was inspected by Army Technical Officers and declared safe, the device was taken away for detailed forensic examination.A number of politicians have expressed concern that this is the third device of its kind linked to dissident republicans which has been discovered in the area over the past two years.Previous devices linked to the terror group have been discovered just a few miles from Seaforde at the Priestrsquos Road and Drumcaw Road near Clough.PSNI District Commander, Superintendent Norman Haslett, has confirmed that the device discovered at the Newcastle Road was a suspected component part of a mortar, but did not contain any explosives.He said that while it was too early to attribute ownership to any particular grouping, he believed that dissident republican terrorists were responsible.Mr Haslett said the matter remained under investigation and appealed for anyone who can assist police with their enquiries to get in contact with them.Politicians have roundly condemned those responsible for leaving the device at the side of one of the districtrsquos most busiest roads.South Down SDLP MLA Colin McGrath, Sinn Fein MLA Emma Rogan and Slieve Croob Ulster Unionist councillor Alan Lewis, said there was no justication for the actions of those responsible.Mr McGrath described the discovery of the mortar component as ldquovery concerning and said the repercussions of the weekend incident could have been devastating.He declared: Such devices are a thing of our past and have no place in our modern country. The inconvenience and impact of this incident on the local community will be considerable and I condemn those that placed that device.ldquoThe fact that the Newcastle Road had to be closed for a number of hours last Saturday evening is both infuriating and depressing. Infuriating because some iniduals wish to bring violence upon us and depressing at the thought of what might have come to pass,the device had not been found and dealt with.Mr McGrath, who thanked the emergency services for their swt response to the security alert, said those responsible ldquohave nothing to offer our society and are utterly contemptible.Condemning those responsible for the ldquodisruptive security alert, Ms Rogan described what happened as ldquoreckless activity.She declared: ldquoThe arearsquos district police commander has confirmed that a component part of a mortar device was found which could have been more sinister. Whoever was responsible for leaving this device and causing this disruption has shown complete disregard for the local community. There can be no justication for this type of reckless activity and those responsible need to cease these futile acts.Cllr Lewis said leaving a device at the side of the road ldquodemonstrates the stupidity of those responsible.He declared: ldquoTerrorism always finds a cause to attach itself and those seeking to ignite chaos and mayhem should reflect on the long-term realities of their aims. Tit-for-tat violence reenergises age-old conflict and no one will benefit from rising tension and public disorder.ldquoThose responsible are Neanderthals, plastic soldiers with romantic fantasies of days gone by. Just what are they trying to achieve Cllr Lewis said residents were ldquorightly alarmed at what happened last weekend, confirming that he is angry that a third mortar-type device has now been found in this part of the district in the past two years.He added: ldquoIt is time for the police to act. I want to see searches, investigations and arrests. I fear that dissident republicans are armed and dangerous and weapons in the hands of those who lack intelligence could quite possibly result in the loss of le.ldquoThis is  not  and those behind this incident need to pack up and go home.

This was the easiest one we could do in terms of social distancing, something which people and families could do together safely.Suzanne, who is a keen runner, has been a member of the Glees for many years, starting off with juniors.ldquoAround  people have signed up for the fundraiser to date and we would be delightedothers would come on board to join us, she continued. ldquoPeople have to do something every day, that is why we chose February as it is the shortest month.ldquoWe have set a target of pound, but did not knowthat was unrealistic or not, but are delighted with the support that we have received to date. We only started on Monday and the support from members and families has been unbelievable. Parents of the Junior Glees are also on board andwe pass our target that we be fantastic.The Junior Glees provided a virtual performance before the end of last year which was headed up by Society members Emma Nugent and Emma-Jane McKnight and was warmly received.ldquoOur committee has been working tirelessly to try and put something in place as the Society is under so much pressure as we canrsquot perform. We are responsible for looking after and maintaining the Annesley Hall and have applied for a few grants which we hope will come though, said Suzanne.ldquoLong before we ever get to the stage of starting rehearsing again we have a lot of work to do including providing sanitising stations and temperature check equipment, while all sinks will have to be replaced to include automatic taps. We also have to provide new auditorium seating, which can be wiped down, and hope we can secure grant money to cover these costs.Suzanne said the February fundraiser will be used to cover the hallrsquos day-to-day running and maintenance costs and that every penny raised will be put to good use.She continued: ldquoWe hope that by the end of the year we will be back in the hall. We are going to push as hard as we can to ensure that we can go back and that the required changes have been made and the hall will be ready.ldquoIt is our plan that we will have all the work that is required completed by the end of the summer so we can hit the ground running. That is why we have applied for grants and launched our fundraising initiative.Suzanne said the dream is to have the hall open again and the Glees rehearsing.She added: ldquoWe may even be able to stage concerts that we have pre-prepared before and perform before small audiences but will have to wait and seethere will be restrictions in terms of audience numbers. At this stage, no one knows.ldquoIt would be amazing to have the hall open again and performing in front of audiences and we would like to think we would be performing shows by Christmas,not sooner.Society members, friends or families, including the Gleesrsquo junior company, who wish to take part are asked to contact Suzanne on  .She added: ldquoWe are asking that as many people please take part at their own pace and have friends and family sponsor them or donate what they can.ldquoWe have created a JustGiving page to share on social media s and would ask people to share their photos or maps of their routes each day to raise awareness, posting on their own social media pages and the Glee Singers Facebook page.Anyone wishing to support the Newcastle Glees with their February fundraiser are asked to visit their JustGiving page at https:www.justgiving crowdfunding newcastleglees.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3Feb2021-Providing.jpg","title":"Providing special needs teaching during lockdown  ","story":"A SPECIAL needs teacher has used the lockdown to create a unique woodland play and outdoor classroom for children who benefit from a range of sensory experiences.Judith Riddell is behind the Empowering Little Minds consultancy in Drumaness and is currently working on a one to one basis outdoors with children with special needs, particularly boys and girls with autism.With the help and support of her husband David, Judith has worked since last March to create a unique and stimulating outdoor woodland classroom that was specically designed to provide a tailored approach to each child.Children aged from three up to  can explore a range of sensory activities on Judithrsquos private woodland and find out what helps them calm down and get to a place where they are able to learn and interact better.The desire to work one to one with children in an outdoor setting has become more important as the former teacher at Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick adapted her business to suit lockdown restrictions.ldquoI had to mody my whole business since the first lockdown after I had self-funded creating my indoor classroom, explained Judith. ldquoI look on it as a positive spin-off from the lockdown as I was closed for nine months. It was something in the back of my mind to do but lockdown made me do it a lot earlier.She started up her consultancy business just over a year ago and has had to ldquothink outside the box since last March when social distancing became a new norm in the pandemic.ldquoWhen I first started the business, I wanted to empower children and their parents who would get an extra boost of some specialised training from me, she said. ldquoSometimes itrsquos hard for children to get all of their educational needs fully met in school.ldquoWhen I work one to one with them, itrsquos amazing to see their progress, even in such a short space of time. You see them really start to fly once their sensory system calms down and they are ready to take in information.Challenged by how she could still run her business during lockdown, Judith decided to put the eight acres of woodland she and her husband owns around their Crawfordstown Road home to good use.ldquoWe took over one acre and created the woodland classroom which can be accessed by a lot of willow structures that I created myself. Therersquos a massive tree house, things to swing on and climb on for the children to enjoy before they go into the woodland classroom which has everything an indoor classroom would have, she said.ldquoItrsquos actually great for both parents and children as they can listen to the birds and enjoy the woodland while their children are involved in learning activities.Judith has  years of experience of education special needs children after graduating from Cambridge University.ldquoI was always passionate about working with children with special needs and when I came back home I was fortunate enough to start working in Knockevin rather than starting in primary schools which I fully expected to do, said Judith.ldquoAfter a while I went to work in Bahrain to set up a school for special needs children on a three-year contract. I came back home just as things began to kick off in the Arab Spring and ed to work at Knockevin.ldquoI decided to set up my own practice in  as it was time to give some empowerment to parents as well as children. It gave me a chance to work with all aspects of a childrsquos development rather than working with one class for the whole year.Judith specialises in working with children aged -. She is also a training consultant for parents to help them understand their childrenrsquos sensory needs and working with staff from health organisations.Judith explained that while working with children with special needs is more complex and involves eight senses mdash not the five senses that we are all more familiar with mdash it can be very rewarding.ldquoAny child whorsquos born does not come with a training book, said Judith. ldquoSpecial needs children have very specic needs and you need to be able to read them in order to cater for that need.ldquoWith the coaching style I use, itrsquos about empowering parents to understand which sensory need their child needs to be fulfilled. With special needs children, you have to fill up with their sensory cup with all eight senses before they can start to learn, When the three extra senses are stimulated, they can be super-calming for everyone but particularly for children who canrsquot communicate their needs.ldquoWhen I coach parents, I explain about the three other senses, and tell what Irsquom doing and why Irsquom doing it to calm their child so that they then can keep using the same strategies at home. As the child learns to self-regulate more, the strategies change and the child is helped along the way.Despite having the space to accommodate more children after lockdown and when group activities are allowed again, Judith is focussed in developing her consultancy with the child always in mind.ldquoThe whole essence of the business is that it does not become a massive enterprise, she stressed.ldquoItrsquos about providing a more quiet, intimate area for the children so that they can feel safe and secure and itrsquos not overly busy. While I can expand and offer more sessions as the days gets longer, the woodland classroom will never be too busy.For further information visit www.empoweringlittleminds..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3Feb2021-NewcastleSPORT.jpg","title":"Royal County Down comes out top  ","story":"ROYAL County Down has been recognised as the most picturesque golf course in the world.The famed Newcastle links came out on top of a study by the Surprise Shop website, which looked at  of the most stunning courses from around the world.The  found that Royal County Down was the subject of , Instagram posts.

Esler hopes that will change soon, when conditions allow the Covid restrictions to be lted. And although no one can predict when that will happen, he is now well-prepared for a new show to take to the stage.Esler has high hopes for his latest creation, ‘Headley’s Garden Adventure’, which tells the story of the tribulations of a hedgehog looking for somewhere to hibernate.“It’s a lovely, happy wee story for children,” he says.The show lasts  minutes with six songs and has characters including two cats, four worms, a crow, a rabbit and a tortoise.Esler explained the inspiration for it came from a visit to his daughter’s house some time ago.“She has two lovely cats and they were in the garage with their backs up, so we knew there was something not right,” he said.“It turned out there was a hedgehog under the chair and it had come in from the garden to look for somewhere to hibernate. I thought afterwards that I could write a children’s story about it and I added animal characters and composed six songs,” he explained.In Esler’s story Headley finds himself thrown out of the garage by one of the cats, which is not at all pleasant, and he is then befriended by a tortoise who tries to help him by suggesting that his friend the rabbit might allow him to stay in his hutch for the winter. The hutch turns out to be too small for Headley to get into, but suffice to say the story does have a happy ending.Now Esler is waiting to have the musical score written and he is planning to make contact with schools and others who may be interested in the unique production. His we Mandy helped with advice on what would engage younger children, having run a nursery in the past. “It is written for children aged between six and eight years of age, and there are good messages about the Highway Code, neighbourliness and even about food and nutrition,” says Esler, who has already been contacted by several interested people after he posted the news of his efforts on social media recently.“People are interested already, I am making contacts and I am getting favourable comments,” he said.Click here to read: Esler takes fresh look at Dickens classic for brand new musical--Thank you for reading this article.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityBefore the pandemic, patients could ring Albert Road Surgery reception in Penarth, say they needed an appointment, and it would all be booked in and they would turn up for their appointment time.However, once coronavirus hit the UK, because of the need to be socially distanced, everything went on the telephones. Part of their new multi-disciplinary model is still in place - where not just GPs are working under the same roof, but pharmacists and physios too. But rather than them coming to the surgery initially, it is via telephone.Dr Kristina Leppik, Dr Quarratul-Ain Yousef, Mrs Kerry Anne-CarterIf it is apparent from the call that they need to come in for a face-to-face, that will be organised. Those that are called in, must follow a one-way-system through the surgery and will have their temperature taken upon arrival.Dr Kristina Leppik, who works at the surgery, said she was apprehensive about this new way of working at first, wonderingGPs would be able to assess patients properly over the phone. But due to prior training in telephone consultations, the transition was smooth and easier than initially thought.On Monday, December , work began on rolling out the Oxford AZ vaccine in the area to patients over . Staff had to make sure that everyone was ready and prepared for this important task, and even took into consideration those that have worries about entering a GP now.Dr Quarratul-Ain Yousef, who moved to the area from Birmingham not long before lockdown began, said the staff have been ldquoquite proactive in trying to adapt by creating an outside pod with a clear shelter ndash which cannot be seen through easily - where people coming in for a vaccine or routine B jab can have it done rather than going insidethey choose.ldquoWersquove reduced risk to our staff, the patients coming in, and reduced risks to patients.ldquoThe initial reason for the shelter was because we thought, well, winter is coming, and people are going to have coughs.ldquoWe might need to listen to them, and instead of bringing them in, how do we assess such a high risk in a safe and confidential manner ldquoWe give them the option, and most people have been fine. And itrsquos been quite nice to feel a bit more relaxed because itrsquos an open environment.As soon as the staff are aware of the amount of stock that they will be getting from the health board, they can organise the clinics.ldquoWe have to factor in the spacing, itrsquos a new vaccine so people might have questions which we are always happy to answer.ldquoSo far itrsquos going pretty well. We are quite ahead of the game.ldquoIrsquom quite pleased with the surgeryrsquos managing with the vaccines. Obviously, it is a new system, but wersquore always up for a challenge and I think we make a really good team.ldquoSo much is going on in the practice to give good care and attention to detail. Wersquore constantly looking at ways to improve things.Mrs Kerry Anne-Carter, assistant practice manager at Albert Road Surgery said ldquowersquore definitely on schedule with the over s patients and are hoping to finish vaccinating the age group by the end of this week.The surgery is also in the midst of getting some extra phone lines installed, due to the sheer number of calls coming in and out.There is a policy in place whereby those in a specic category will be contacted about having the vaccine, and staff advise people not to call asking to have one as it blocks the line for others with medical concerns.Albert Road Surgery are also taking on new patients, you can either get a form from reception, apply online, or print off a form on the website. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Paul is not only a colleague but a trusted friend, who has served his constituents and party with distinction, and will continue to do so.ldquoThere is urgent work in front of all of us and our immediate focus will be continuing to hold the Labour administration in the Senedd to account on vital issues such as the vaccine rollout, and fighting Mays election alongside our excellent slate of candidates and dedicated volunteers.ldquoWe are in a moment like no other, and the COVID- pandemic has sadly only served to shine a spotlight on the challenges in peoplersquos everyday lives challenges that have been made all the harder by twenty of Welsh Labour Government failure.ldquoFrom our fragile economy to ever increasing NHS waiting lists, people in Wales have been badly let down by successive Labour administrations. Let me be clear devolution isnrsquot the issue, it is the socialists in the Labour Party, and Wales deserves better.ldquoIn just over  days, the Welsh public will head to the ballot box to decide on the future they want for our country and in the coming weeks and months the Welsh Conservatives will put forward a positive plan to get Wales moving again and build back our country better than ever.ldquoThis will be in tough election during a tough time for our country and whereas other parties want to use this period to ide and separate, wersquoll seek to unite our country and deliver a strong voice for Wales, in a strong United Kingdom.Chairman of the Welsh Conservative Group in the Senedd, Janet Finch-Saunders MS said Mr Davies had been confirmed in the post following a meeting of the Welsh Conservative Group in the Senedd this morning.ldquoAs Chairman of the Group, I want to say thank you to Paul Davies for his immense efforts in the post since . Paul played a key role in our record-breaking General Election in , whilst setting the groundwork ahead of Mays Senedd election.ldquoOur attention now turns to May and taking the fight to the Labour Party. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe Penarth and District Lesotho Trust, who since  have organised several group visits for people from the Penarth area to Lesotho, South Africa, following several visits by members of local churches, and links were made specically with the town of Teyateyaneng.Over the years, the initial focus of contact between churches broadened out so that the relationship developed to involve schools, childrenrsquos homes, and the wider community.Every two years, a group of young people, mainly from Stanwell School, visited Teyateyaneng and spent time teaching in Rantuba High School and St Matthias Primary School, taking with them stationery and a iety of hats, gloves, and scarves, all of which had been donated by friends and family.Last year, two of the trustees arranged for twenty boxes of used Lego and Duplo, which had also been donated, to be shipped to Lesotho and then went out to distribute it around the schools and give training on its use to the teachers.A very special relationship developed with two organisations in particular ndash the TY Junior Academy, a residential school founded by Godfrey Kakande and run now by his daughter Irene Nagingo, and St Ceciliarsquos Orphanage and Centre for Teenage Mothers run by Father Augustine Mahlaku.Father Augustine Mahlaku at St Ceciliarsquos Church ndash during the welcome for the Youth Group in Much of the fundraising has been for these two places, although the charity has also financed drought relief and the training of a nurse, supported a clinic in the capital of Maseru, and helped Growing Nations which aims to teach sustainable agriculture to young people.MORE NEWS:At the school, the Trust has been able to fund the building of a kitchen, a library and refurbishment of classrooms and at St Ceciliarsquos money has been sent to build a meeting room and purchase agricultural equipment and supplies.This will be the last meeting as the decision to dissolve the charity was taken last year due to the trustees being unable to continue due to health and or family reasons, leaving only six trustees which is an insufficient number and would reduce even further within a year.Attempts to recruit more trustees have been unsuccessful and so, with regret, it was decided to close the charity, winding it down over the course of this year.PADLT would like to thank the people of Penarth and district for supporting the charity by giving donations and attending its annual plant sale and craft fair and other events over the years.The next annual general meeting of the Trust will be held on Tuesday, February ,  at .am via Zoom link.If anyone would like further information or would like to attend the AGM, please send an email to padlt.info@gmail. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

Business support was a key topic, and it was devastating to hear Tina McKenzie, Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, discuss the hardships being faced and demonstrating the very bleak outlook for many businesseswe do not find a way forward both in terms of the handling of the pandemic,but also enhancing the support available to these businesses. The impact on business is substantial and that on each of their employees is devastating. Furlough has been a hottopic during this lockdown and as we have seen business vilied for not looking atrestructures, she reminded us of the fact that whilst the support available is welcomed, itremains far from enough to enable survival. I recently received an email from a local politician who stated, “I’m in awe you are still in business”. While this could be accepted as a compliment, this is far from the support andvoice a small business like mine requires or is looking for, and this was conveyed to them. The business community needs a clear voice with a key message and desire, rather than noise. These voices, like Tina, work tirelessly to press the government to step in with moresupport, minimising their costs and contribution while revenues are non-existent, and Iapplaud them for doing so. With news breaking this week that there is still pound million remaining in the Stormont COVID “pot” to be allocated towards businesses before March, I would urge Diane Doddsand Conor Murphy to listen to businesses and their representatives to ensure businessessurvive. It would be truly shamefulthis money had to be ed to Westminster as a result of poor planning and slow reactions, while local businesses are making very dficultdecisions due to lack of financial support which clearly is available, but not utilised. With financial survival for businesses and more importantly each of us as iniduals and our families the sole aim, Tina succinctly reminded us that our elected representatives should beheld to account, not the businesses themselves. The Sunday Times recently reported that the public feels more frightened now than at any time before with % of voters feeling ‘personally threatened’ by COVID. It also reportedthat Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have agreed on a ‘recovery plan’ to save jobs. The realityis however, thatthey and our own Executive do not deliver this strategy correctly, without delay or U-turn, the job market will constrict further. Many professional trade bodies arereporting that their members don’t have enough in the bank until April and judging bynumerous reports this past week, lockdown and on-going restrictions are likely to extend beyond April. How can businesses be expected to survive without this  We all have a voice, but not all of us use it. As a business community we need vocal and active business leaders to speak out to help fight our case. A great demonstrative exampleof this is the great work of my good friend Brian Donaldson from Excluded NI. Throughout,Brian has spoken out and acted to help thousands who have been financially excluded with no support being provided to them. Brian had established himself as newly self-employedchef just before lockdown, only to find that as support packages were announced, he quickly found himself excluded from all government support offered. With a family, and amortgage to pay, Brian created a  for his case to constructively find a resolution forall those who found themselves in the same situation. By working closely with local politicians, Brian, has researched and submitted proposals to the Department for the Economy with numerous resolutions and proposals to deliver financialassistance to these groups, which has resulted in thousands, including Ltd Company directors,eventually being awarded some financial support. Brian continues daily to ensure the excluded have a voice and shows how being a voice can bring about change! As a business owner, I send a huge thank you to all the hard-working professional trade bodies and voices for our communities, who throughout this time have worked tirelessly toensure we all have all have a business toto in the future. If you, like so many, are in adficult situation, be sure to reach out to your local business trade body today to highlight your plight and use their voices as much as you can. We all need as much support andsurvival mechanism as possible. It’s evident that the more voices there are and the louderthey become successful outcomes can be delivered. I will wrap up by leaving you with a well-known quote by Napoleon Bonaparte: ‘Ten people who speak make more noise than ten thousand who are silent’. Until next week, stay safe!

In line with the Department of Health’s twin track approach to accelerate vaccinations, both the online system and telephone booking line can be used by those in the - age group to make an appointment at one of the seven regional vaccination centres. While demand for vaccination slots is high, people are reminded that there will be enough appointments for everyone in the group so please remain patient. In the last five days the online booking system has been used to make , appointments. People are asked to reserve capacity on the telephone booking linefor those who cannot avail of the online booking facility. Where possible we would encourage booking appointments online. It is also anticipated that demand for telephone bookings will initially be very high. Therefore,you cannot get through initially, please be patient and try again later. Call volumes tend to be lower later in the day. If you can’t get through immediately then try again. The service is available from Monday to Friday .am to .pm. To fall within the - age bracket you must have been born between  April  and  March . Age and identity checks will be conducted at the vaccination centres. People outside the relevant age group should not misuse the online or telephone booking facility. Misuse will only make it more dficult for those to get through who are being prioritised because of their clinical vulnerability. GPs will be working in parallel to the regional vaccination centres and will focus on the  plus age group. This group cannot use this booking facility. GPs will make contact with their patients in this age group, therefore people do not need to phone their GP practice. This twin track approach announced by the Department of Health last week will help accelerate NI’s vaccination programme - ensuring more people can take up the offer of vaccination and help protect themselves against Covid-.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_edebafccadd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cabbeecaaba   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1612449270614.jpg--covid_19___thu_4th_feb_figures.jpg?161244927000","title":"covid  thu th feb figures ","story":" The NI Department of Health dashboard shows a further  coronavirus related deaths and  new positive cases.  deaths occurred outside of the current reporting period.
