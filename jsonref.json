Until then, the girls\u0027 childhood on the outskirts of Bristol had been happy and Rowling was already showing signs of being a gifted, imaginative child.\u0027From the age of three, Joanne could read a newspaper article or book. She was always writing plays and stories for her friends and sister to read and perform,\u0027 Peter recalled. He and Joanne\u0027s mum loved to read the girls Noddy, Wind In The Willows and Thomas the Tank Engine books.Yet when the family moved to the close-knit community in the Forest of Dean, Joanne found it tough. Aged nine, she was at an age at which children are starting to form deep friendships and can be susceptible to peer pressure.In her 2012 interview with New Yorker Magazine, she said: \u0027My voice wasn\u0027t Forest of Dean, although it became Forest of Dean pretty damn quickly.\u0027Despite her feelings of alienation, it is easy to see how her new home might have fired Rowling\u0027s imagination. Julian Mercer, a TV producer who bought the property from the family in 1995 for £84,000, described the architecture as \u0027very Hogwartslike\u0027.Yet in real life, tragedy was unfurling. When Rowling was 12, Anne fell ill, the first clue her body wasn\u0027t functioning when she struggled to pick up a teapot.Rowling was always close to her mother. \u0027Anne was there for the girls, while I was away at work a lot,\u0027 Peter later recalled.A bookish teen who went on to be head girl, Rowling took her studies seriously, with her English teacher Steve Eddy saying in 2007 her \u0027work always showed impressive imagination and in class she was bright and enthusiastic\u0027.Yet there was a rebelliousness, too. In The Casual Vacancy there is a restless teenager called Andrew, whom Rowling admits exhibits parallels with her own life. \u0027Andrew\u0027s romantic idea that he\u0027ll go and live among the graffiti and broken windows of London: that was me,\u0027 she said in 2012. \u0027I thought: \u0027I have to get away from this place.\u0027 \u0027Describing her adolescence a \u0027dreadful time of life\u0027, Rowling has recalled, nonetheless, how her mum maintained an indefatigable optimism. Last week parish councillor Sheila Bollen, who ran the store where Anne used to buy her daughters\u0027 school uniform, said she had \u0027no idea she was unwell until right to the end\u0027. Rowling, who had graduated from Exeter University in 1986, learned her mother had died, on New Year\u0027s Eve in 1990, while holidaying with an ex-boyfriend.\u0027She died at home of respiratory failure. She was 45, and I still can\u0027t write about her without crying,\u0027 Rowling said.In 2010, she founded the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic at the University of Edinburgh with a gift of £10 million in her mother\u0027s memory.Shattered, she moved to Portugal to work as an English teacher shortly afterwards, embarking on a volatile relationship with journalist Jorge Arantes, with whom she had a daughter, Jessica.Meanwhile, Peter started a relationship with orced secretary Janet Gallivan, with whom he worked. They married in 1993.The same year, Rowling left Arantes and moved with Jessica to live with her sister in Edinburgh, where she famously survived on benefits while writing Harry Potter And The Philosopher\u0027s Stone, which was published in 1997.She dedicated the book to her mother, sister and daughter, with no mention of her father.Peter and his daughter repaired their relationship enough for Rowling to invite him to her 2001 wedding to Dr Murray, with whom she now has two teenage children. Two of only 14 guests, Peter and his second wife were flown to Scotland by private jet and picked up from the airport in limos.How much more it must have hurt, then, for Rowling to discover two years later that her father was selling first-edition copies of her work — signed \u0027Lots of love from your firstborn\u0027 — at Sotheby\u0027s.Peter, who pocketed £50,000 for four books, later said he had forewarned his daughter he needed to auction the books to cover debts, admitting she was \u0027livid\u0027.Then, in 2012, Rowling suggested to an interview with the New Yorker magazine that they\u0027d fallen out before Peter auctioned her books — over what, it\u0027s not known. \u0027We\u0027ve not had any communication for about nine years.\u0027Confusingly, Peter was insisting everything was fine, telling a Mail on Sunday reporter: \u0027Everything is good. There is no problem any more.\u0027Maybe buying her childhood home in 2011 provided the thawing in relations between the two.Or maybe the clue lies in an interview Rowling gave in 2012, when she spoke about her French ancestry, on her mother\u0027s side. Revealing how her great-grandfather had won a Croix de Guerre award for his bravery in World War I, Rowling made perhaps her most telling comment on her motive.\u0027I married someone who\u0027s got a vast Scottish family — a clan, really — which is fabulous. But I wanted to have something I could show my children and say: \u0027Look, I also have a family, I also have a background.\u0027 \u0027And now she has a childhood home, packed with memories, that she can share.Additional reporting: Stephanie Condron"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/26/22/27680266-8259195-image-a-59_1587937035063.jpg","title":"Furloughed British workers pick fruit veg suggests Environment Secretary","story":"Share this article Earlier this month, farmers defended special charter flights to pick up hundreds of workers from Romania and bring them to Britain. Figures released last week show that more than 430,000 business had applied for the Government scheme to pay the wages of 3.2million workers. Mr Eustice also said that supplies of food within the retail sector were back to normal pre-crisis levels but more delivery slots were needed to provide for those buying food online. "},{"url":null,"title":"Cops blast lockdown rules make no sense","story":"Share this articleTop cop urges Government to ‘get a grip as lockdown rules cause confusion – The Scottish Sun"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12883e39c8eae889971f84fc01a15146a7a637ba/0_247_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23982fe489d4b68dc6462229999690ed","title":"home not away the tulip project in pictures","story":"What does the ’s decorated sports photographer do in lockdown?  Tom Jenkins has been taking an enforced break from action photography and pursuing a different kind of vision in his gardenI have never appreciated my back garden so much.At this time of year, I’m usually caught up with all the to-ings and fro-ings of the sporting world: taking photos of traditional spring events like the Boat Race and Grand National, or key matches as the football season builds to a crescendo. Normally I’m away a lot, not really passing an eye over developments in my garden. But this is not a normal year.It was mid-March, and I was sitting despondently in my tiny postage stamp of a garden. The previous week I had photographed the Cheltenham festival, an event I associate with the end of winter, spring coming, the light getting better. A chance to look ahead to a summer of sport, going to events that I love. But this year, the festival had felt all wrong – more like a dangerous party on the eve of war. It seemed all around me the news was harrowing, and sport was getting hammered as event after event was cancelled. My world had suddenly been turned upside-down.I realised then that I had to reframe and refocus. With all my normal avenues for taking pictures closed off, I needed to find something else. I recalled the words of Ed Jackson, a former professional rugby player whose portrait I had taken exactly a year earlier. After suffering an awful accident that had left him partially paralysed, he had developed a mental process to cope with his new situation: focus on what’s in front of you, focus on things you can affect, and try to forget what’s out of your control.Remembering this, I looked round the edge of the tiny piece of lawn and noticed some tulip bulbs that my wife had planted in terracotta pots. Lush green leaves with buds full of promise had emerged from the soil, ready to bloom. In these plants, I saw hope. I saw normality.It occurred to me then that this process of growth and positivity deserved to be documented. Despite the global madness, nature was thriving – and these tulips seemed to be begging me to tell their story. To me, photography is more than just a career: it is my passion, and in these flowers I found the perfect opportunity to take pictures without leaving my home.To test myself, I decided not to use any of my main professional cameras. These are more used to the hurly-burly of sport, all fast focusing and speedy motor-drive. Instead, I turned to what I call my “holiday camera”, an upmarket point-and-shoot that I take away on trips with the family (the last thing I want on holiday is to be surrounded by items associated with work, many of which are heavy). Light, easy to manoeuvre around the plants, and – most crucially – able to focus close-up, this small camera actually turned out to be perfect for this project.As the sun moved round the garden during the day, backgrounds became dark and shadows on the flowers created gorgeous patterns. I would note which times were best to photograph certain plants, and would periodically drop whichever household task I was doing (much to the irritation of my family) to race to the garden and catch the flowers in the perfect light.Like all photographers, I look to light as another tool in the box, an opportunity to create something different. By varying angles, I could make petals look like paper, tightly bunched flower heads look like lips. Going in tight, I attempted to show the beauty of the flowers in a surreal way. The warm spring sunshine of the last few weeks had not only ushered the tulips into full bloom but enhanced their colour and vibrancy, so some of my photographs gained an almost unearthly quality.I’ve never felt so lucky to have my garden, this tiny oasis in densely crowded north London. In the land of quarantine, my house has never felt more like a castle, defending me from the warzone outside the front gate. In that castle, my garden is the green inner sanctum, a place of peace and tranquillity.As I sit here now, in the sunshine, I hear birdsong and the rustling of leaves, with the chirruping of children playing wafting in on the breeze. The sky above my head is free from planes and pollution and a brilliant blue. The sun, bright and sharp at this time of year, makes everything look crisp. In times like these, we remember that nature truly is life-affirming, and the simple act of flowers growing means so much. It shows that in an abnormal world, normality is king."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06228081fd9bcaa9313ca32b836c8ff7882fdca5/0_0_3884_6046/master/3884.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6fb66475bcccaf8fe49afc2cbeb9714b 700w","title":"majority of authors hear their characters speak finds study","story":"Some writers have always claimed they can hear their characters speaking, with Enid Blyton suggesting she could “watch and hear everything” and Alice Walker describing how her characters would “come for a visit ... and talk”. But a new study has shown this uncanny experience is very widespread, with almost two-thirds of authors reporting that they hear their characters’ voices while they work.“I hear them in my mind. They have distinct voice patterns and tones, and I can make them carry on conversations with each other in which I can always tell who is ‘talking’,” said one anonymous writer. “They sometimes tell me that what I have in mind for them isn’t right – that they would never behave or speak that way. I don’t usually answer back,” said another.“When I’m trying to ‘put words in their mouth’ instead of listening they often talk back. And then we discuss things until I find what they would say,” reported one anonymous respondent. Another revealed that their characters’ voices were distinct from their own inner speech: “When my characters are running dialogue in my head I feel like a spectator, but with my own inner speech I feel like the one speaking.”According to Durham University’s Dr John Foxwell, the lead researcher on the project, the authors in the study reported a wide variety of experiences.“The writers we surveyed definitely weren’t all describing the same experience,” Foxwell said, “and one way we might make sense of that is to think about how writing relates to inner speech.” Internal dialogue, or inner speech, is a phenomenon that people experience in many different ways, he continued, with some people including the voices of people they know as part of their verbal thinking. “Whether or not we’re always aware of it, most of us are trying to anticipate what other people are going to say and do in everyday interactions. For some of these writers, it might be the case that after a while their characters start to feel independent because the writers developed the same kinds of personality ‘models’ as they’d develop for real people, and these were generating the same kinds of predictions.”One Day novelist David Nicholls said he could hear his characters, “and I think I could pick them out of a line-up too. They certainly have a physicality and a vocal rhythm, though often for me that comes from actors rather than real-life friends.”The bestselling crime novelist Val McDermid recognised the phenomenon, but explained that she is able to exert a measure of control. “They don’t just pop up out of nowhere,” she said. “But when I’m working on a novel, I have conversations in my head with them. When I’m out for a walk, there are all sorts of interrogations going on in my head and sometimes out loud. But if I’m not working with a character, silence.”As a writer who has worked in parallel on independent series of novels, this ability to quiet the voices in her head is crucial. If she’s working on a Karen Pirie novel, for example, McDermid will never hear the voices of other series characters Carol Jordan or Kate Brannigan. And there’s never any question of who is in charge.“I do not think they act independently,” McDermid said. “They have the life I give them and no more. Sometimes when I set myself a problem or a question before I go to sleep, my subconscious provides the answer in the morning, and that answer is sometimes surprising or unexpected. But I don’t think I’m possessed by the characters I just think my subconscious is good at processing data.”Her mind may be working hard in the background, she added, but there are limits. “I don’t feel their physical presence. Nor do I smell them...”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fed42537ce2e84f7f72df1db39cc720cc206559/0_173_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=275992d2712852ff2b4f2b8276954dc7","title":"stock markets rally covid 19 lockdown oil recession ftse business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial newsThe aerospace giant has warned its 135,000 employees that it may not survive the coronavirus lockdown unless it takes immediate action .CEO Guillaume Faury told staff in a letter on Friday that the plane maker was “bleeding cash at an unprecedented speed”, due to the slump in demand for new planes following the Covid-19 pandemic.Faury warned that the firm “may now need to plan for more far-reaching measures” - which could mean job cuts, adding.“The survival of Airbus is in question if we don’t act now.”After a risk-on morning, Europe’s stock markets are all holding their gains.Investors are shrugging off the record surge in French unemployment, and Boris Johnson’s caution about lifting the UK’s lockdown.Trevor Greetham, Head of Multi Asset at Royal London Asset Management, says the markets are generally calmer - thanks to the recent emergency stimulus measures from governments and central banks. “Markets usually stop panicking when policy makers start to. Stocks recovered about half of their losses after massive fiscal and monetary easing was announced.With sentiment back to neutral, the outlook from here depends on the uncertain path back to normality. “In our multi asset funds, we are taking a flexible approach. We currently have a small overweight in equities and a strong preference for high yield bonds, which benefit from effective policy maker support, over commodities and property, which don’t. We are overweight US equities versus the UK and technology versus financials at the sector level.”Wall Street bank Morgan Stanley has warned that Europe’s recession will be even deeper than first feared.It now expects Covid-19 lockdowns to last longer than previously thought, and to be relaxed more slowly (with large scale events banned for some time, and investment and consumption staying weak).Greece, which has been praised for implementing an early lockdown, is now getting ready to relax it.The relaxation of restrictions in Greece designed to stop the spread of the Covid-19 virus will be gradual and targeted while the stages of lifting the measures will be spaced apart in order to evaluate their effectiveness, Government Spokesman Stelios Petsas said.The first phase starting on May 4 will see the reopening of shops and hairdressers, churches will also open their door for personal worship while some schools will start operating in a second phase and travel between regions will be permitted on a gradual basis, Petsas said in Athens.Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis will present Greece’s overall plan for a transition out of a total lockdown situation on Tuesday while ministers will provide specific details afterward, he said.Just in: Unemployment in France jumped sharply last month, as the Covid-19 lockdown hit its economy.The number of French citizens filing jobless claims jumped by 246,100 in March, according to the Labour Ministry, to over 3.7 million people.Global markets are also being cheered by another central bank stimulus package.Earlier today the Bank of Japan tripled the amount of corporate debt it would buy, and pledge to buy unlimited amount of government bonds to help Japan’s economy.The BoJ also slashed its growth forecasts, and admitted that inflation would (once again) miss its targets.BoJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s latest move reassured investors that central bankers will keep printing money to ward off a Covid-19 depression (which should keep asset prices buoyant).Global oil traders are braced for another gloomy week after crude prices slumped this morning despite plans for major oil production cuts from Friday.The market jitters are most acute in the US where oil storage tanks are filled to the brim.The price of West Texas Intermediate, the US crude benchmark, fell by almost $2.50 to $14.69 a barrel while the price of Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell by more than a $1 to $20.36 a barrel in early trade. Analysts at Rystad predict that oil prices will continue to fall until a significant amount of output is ‘shut-in’, by producers closing their wells.The plan to rein in oil production from the world’s largest oil producers, spear-headed by Saudi Arabia, is due to come in to force in May but “are not enough to alter the current situation”.Bjornar Tonhaugen, head of oil markets at Rystad, warns: “The storage clock is ticking for producers and we are approaching the final countdown if no further action is taken.”The bank says consumers are falling victim to order scams for products like hand sanitiser and face masks, that on average leads to losses of around £209. This is according to data which the bank collected between 9-14 April.Barclays is warning consumers to be wary of prices that look too good to be true, or companies that claim to have products in stock when everyone else seems to be sold out. It also says consumers should check whether a website is a genuine address by looking at the spelling in their website’s URL. Ross Martin, Head of Digital Safety at Barclays said: Many of us are at home spending more time online using social media and browsing the internet. There is a risk people will be lured into purchasing items with a big discount or that are unavailable elsewhere.Don’t become a victim of these scams and always check who you’re purchasing from and do your research before making a payment.Bangladesh’s textile industry is returning to work today, in another sign that some lockdown measures are easing.Reuters has the details:More than 500 garment factories in Bangladesh that supply to global brands reopened on Monday after a month-long shutdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus, while in India calls grew for an easing of its lockdown which has caused deep economic pain.Clothing manufacturers in Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka and the port city of Chittagong have been permitted to resume work. Some of the world’s biggest clothing firms including Gap, Zara-owner Inditex, and H\u0026ampM source their supplies from Bangladesh.“We are making sure the workers wear masks, wash hands at the entrance, undergo temperature checks, and maintain physical distancing,” said Mohammad Hatem, vice president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association.Industry groups for the sector, which boasts some 4,000 factories employing 4.1 million workers, had warned the shutdown could cause the country to lose $6 billion in export revenue this financial year. Boris Johnson’s call for patience hasn’t caused any ructions in the City."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af3e3a161fceb4436eecaea71dda99027ad003f7/0_56_5996_3599/master/5996.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b67bbc6e142245178ea897b708d91ff","title":"coronavirus sage scientific groupthink","story":"The reaction to the 1976 swine flu outbreak in the US is a prime example of the dangers of scientific groupthinkEarlier this month in the , the Lancet editor, Richard Horton, suggested that “coronavirus is the greatest global science policy failure in a generation”. He recalled the many experts who have been predicting such a pandemic, some for decades, and argued that in the UK, “the experts – scientists who have modelled and simulated our possible futures – made assumptions that turned out to be mistaken.” If he is right, and I think he is, then we should ask, why?I’ve been researching the control of infectious diseases for 30 years, and I believe that an earlier debacle – one perhaps forgotten by many – offers insights. In 1976, fearful that an outbreak of swine influenza at Fort Dix army camp in New Jersey was the centre of an influenza pandemic on a scale potentially similar to the 1918 Spanish flu, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised President Gerald Ford of the urgent need for a mass immunisation programme.The similarity between this swine influenza and the 1918 pandemic was overstated. But in the meantime, 40 million Americans were vaccinated. And the vaccine was associated with cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, some fatal. In the immediate aftermath, the affair was seen as a fiasco.In their remarkable study of the event, Richard Neustadt and Harvey Fineberg set out the lessons learned. Their report, The Swine Flu Affair: Decision-Making on a Slippery Disease, is unlike almost every other report I have ever read. It is a candid, unsanitised analysis that aims to determine the managerial errors made and draw lessons so that they would not be repeated. The report was commissioned by Joseph Califano, Ford’s secretary of health, education and welfare: “Lessons were what he wanted,” wrote the report’s authors, “not a history finger-pointing did not interest him in terms of last time his concern was with next time.”What lessons from that report should we reflect on now? Two, I think, are especially important. First, we should be cautious that experts may be overconfident in theories that are “spun from meagre evidence”. Second, we should question “scientific logic and implementation prospects”.The key issue the authors identified was that groupthink led to misjudgments of the evidence, and failed to question assumptions and voices that opposed were silenced, excluded or denied entry. “Collegial relations” in key advisory committees were too close, many members worked “with mutual confidence”. They “would talk it out together before writing memoranda to each other”. In a critical passage, the report states: “Panels tend toward ‘group think’ and over-selling, tendencies nurtured by long-standing interchanges and intimacy, as in the influenza fraternity. Other competent scientists, who do not share their group identity or vested interests, should be able to appraise the scientific logic applied to available evidence.”I know many of the current members of the UK’s key government committees. The membership of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) is publicly available. The membership of the more important committee, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which is responsible for scientific advice to the Cabinet Office briefing room, was revealed on Friday after a list was leaked.I like all the people I know on these committees. They are extremely bright. And I believe their values and motivations are “good”. But I worry that their intimacy, their familiarity, lends itself to groupthink. Are there sufficient contrarian views? Are critically important assumptions subjected to sufficient critique? Is groupthink acknowledged as a risk, and if so, how is it addressed?The roles taken on by the members are enormously important. The decision-making process is challenging, but must be scrutinised. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and self-identified member of Sage, has talked of receiving personal abuse because of his position on Sage. But the deliberations and minutes and, in my view, the academic disciplines of the members should be made public, if not members’ names. Transparency and scrutiny are critically important if groupthink is to be avoided. The revelation that Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s adviser, has been attending Sage meetings, adds urgency to this demand.Without this, the integrity, impartiality, and independence of the committee and its members will continue to be regarded as suspect. When political influence is added to groupthink among scientists – should it have occurred – then the result can only be a diminution of the committee’s authority and the advice it gives.In their report, Neustadt and Fineberg wrote: “Policy decisions regarding influenza rest on judgments about the behaviour of the virus, the impact of the disease and our ability to interdict its course. But the virus is capricious, the disease elusive, and our remedies imperfect.” All of us involved in attempting to control Covid-19, which means all of us, should reflect with humility, embrace those who challenge our assumptions, and draw on these lessons. • Richard Coker is emeritus professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8192d1268cef0feab8fbb62ac9236279195da11f/0_740_2471_1482/master/2471.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f129f9e8686ddf824d8499c7a99383e6","title":"martin amis london fields alsatian clive teenager","story":"My dad introduced me to Amis’s dog-eared characters and dark comedy as a teenager. Wisely he didn’t say what it was aboutAs lockdown continues,  Opinion is reviving its A book that changed me series, an opportunity for writers to select the very best reading to help get us through these uncertain times, with a new instalment every Monday.I was around 16 or 17 when my dad handed over a copy of Martin Amis’s London Fields and told me I should read it, that it would probably make me laugh. He is a dogged and passionate advocate for the things he loves, my dad, so what he actually said was: “You must read it. You will find it funny. You’ll love it, I promise you. Wait until you get to Keith. Wait until you get to Clive.”I remember he laughed richly and for a long time at the mention of Clive’s name, at the very idea of the world’s No 1 fictional alsatian, lying like a doorstop on the floor of the Black Cross pub, getting showered in the ash from Keith Talent’s cigarettes, panting hotly on various blighted pavements, being called Clive. Ahaha ...My dad didn’t say what it was about, which was smart of him. As I have learned to my cost over the years, it is a very rare person who will be sold on London Fields by a description of the plot, which is confusing, a bit top-heavy and very much beside the point. Technically, yes, Amis’s 1989 novel is a murder mystery (or, as the jacket copy mortifyingly puts it, a “postmodern whodunnit”), centred around Nicola Six and her inscrutable efforts to get murdered in the way she has foreseen, by a man whose identity is known only to her. In theory, yes, the “mystery” for the reader lies in finding out whether the murderer is Keith Talent (the cheat) or Guy Clinch (the foil), and in watching to see how old Nicola chivvies the various participants along. It doesn’t sound good when you put it like that.It certainly doesn’t sound like something I would have been drawn to at 16 – if someone had started talking to me about “postmodern whodunnits” when I was that age, I would have made a loud screaming noise until they promised never to talk to me about books ever again.  But my dad was right: I couldn’t believe how much good stuff there was, just page upon page of Keith Talent doing appalling things and then saying “yeah cheers” afterwards, various characters sloping off for “a quiet glass of porno”, Nicola Six scheming away, having refreshing ideas about underwear and kissing, Guy Clinch being stabbed in the eyes by his evil child, Samson Young moaning and groaning about time going about its immemorial work of making everyone look and feel like shit. All that.The fact that large tracts of it whizzed directly over my teenage head only made it more appealing. It was good that I could not make head or tail of the ending, or all that business with “Mark Asprey”, and the stuff about the narrator constantly on the phone trying to get through to Missy Harter, being barred by her vicious secretary who for some reason is named Janit. What was Missy Harter’s role in all this? What was her job, even? I couldn’t say. If you’d put a gun to my head, I couldn’t have told you why Nicola Six did anything that Nicola Six did. Again, the book’s opacity was key to its appeal.It’s a sort of magic trick, that feeling, when it becomes not so much a matter of taste as of identity: by loving London Fields, you can become the sort of person who loves London Fields, who will hopefully one day understand what any of it actually means. I carried my copy around with me all over the place – it was the one with the neon writing and the blurry TV still of the naked woman on the front. I did this partly to will into reality a scenario I had envisioned where an older and smarter version of me would see me reading it and become my best friend, but mostly because I just could not get enough of it. There’s a bit quite early on where Keith Talent and Guy Clinch are walking to Keith’s “drinking club”, the Golgotha. A silence grows between them as they walk, and Guy seizes on football, “a subject which had often helped him out in the past”. He asks Keith about a match he’d missed the week before, and Keith launches into this unbelievable speech, producing a perfect stream of terrible sportswriter clichés: “During the first half the Hammers probed down the left flank. Revelling in the space, the speed of Sylvester Drayon was always going to cause problems for the home side’s number two.” Trying to make sense of this display later, the narrator says: “At first I thought he’d just memorised sections of the tabloid sports pages. Absolutely wrong … When Keith goes to a football match, that misery of stringer’s cliches is what he actually sees.”That’s me and London Fields. I loved it so much and thought about it so much that it changed the way I apprehended certain slices of reality. To this day I cannot look at an old alsatian without warmly thinking Clive. I do it with younger alsatians, too, except with them I think Future Clive. Soon to reach his true form as Clive. I cannot hear a story about a badly behaved toddler without thinking Marmaduke, and then forcing myself to stop thinking of the part where the narrator describes him “fucking a light socket (he’s the right height for that, with a little bend of the knees.)”. I cannot come up against anything to do with darts without quietly whispering the word “clinicism” to myself. “Gracing the oche.” “The sincerity of the dart.”I cannot read another Amis novel without at least briefly thinking “I wish Clive were here,” and I certainly cannot read an article or review where someone talks about their contentious relationship with Amis’s writing or starts going on about their problematic relationship with Amis’s best friend, “The Hitch”, without longing for three or four paragraphs acknowledging the superiority of London Fields as a work of art.There are lots of books I love equally as much or more, but there’s something unique about London Fields’ ability to get into my head and stay there. On the phone to my dad the other day, I told him I was writing about it, and the first thing he said was: “Don’t forget about Clive.” I was almost offended at the suggestion, as I imagine Keith Talent himself would be. You don’t just go around forgetting about Clive like that, and you don’t forget about London Fields, either.• Rosa Lyster is a writer who lives in Cape Town"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/120a8a5dc6067c316309344cf1b14f53c01147f8/0_98_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=627b6c419d06fb0de6d4b2ef1421a28d","title":"public inquiry coronavirus","story":"The British government knows it has messed up. So it will dodge and delay a public inquiry until the moment passesAs calls mount for an inquiry into the government’s coronavirus response, the answer we hear is: now is not the time. When Dominic Raab was asked last week if the government would commit to holding a public inquiry, he resorted to the impatient language of priorities. “When we get through this crisis,” he huffed, only then will it be “important to take stock”.Here’s what we already know. The government delayed implementing a lockdown for no clear reason – perhaps it was the prime minister’s outsized regard for the “freedom-loving instincts of the British people”, or a misguided bid to pursue “herd immunity” – and then reversed its position. Weeks were wasted, and thousands of lives were lost. The government abruptly stopped its contact-tracing programme in mid-March it claimed mass testing wasn’t necessary, and then U-turned while repeatedly shifting the goalposts on the number of tests to be done. It did not provide adequate levels of PPE for NHS and care home staff, and hundreds of workers are dying. This government’s Conservative predecessors underfunded the NHS and undermined the UK’s preparedness for a major crisis such as a pandemic.These are the facts. But this moment is a reminder that facts do not speak for themselves. Because here’s another fact: the government is immensely popular. Even as new polls hint at growing concern over specific aspects of the response – with a majority now critical of the government’s handling of testing – there is still widespread approval of the government’s overall handling of the crisis.There’s no point sneering at these numbers: governments around the world have seen a rise in their ratings, as the view that “we’re all in it together” rallies populations behind their leaders. Especially when we are actually physically all in it together, locked down and bereaved. Here, of course, even the prime minister has not been spared by the virus – and the image of an ailing leader, overworking himself into intensive care, might alone soften calls for an inquiry into his government’s failings.Separately, there is a reluctance to “shout at the pilot in mid-air” – a form of deference that will ensure that as long as the plane is still in the air, the government’s ratings will also continue to defy gravity, no matter how poorly its flight path was chosen. And it doesn’t hurt the pilot’s cause that much of the in-flight entertainment is dedicated to repeating his team’s claims about how well they’re doing.For all that the facts look damning for the government, the overall picture presented to the public has not been notable for its scrutiny and scepticism. This is not a swipe at an amorphous “media” failing to hold the government to account. Many journalists are probing and investigating – and getting flak for doing so. But much of the press has either stenographically taken the government’s word for things, or relegated the awkward matter of our appalling death toll to a mere footnote amid other concerns about life under lockdown. Last week, The Sun had a front-page splash that read “Lockdown blow. Pubs shut until Xmas”. On a small image of a Covid-19 virus splodge on the same page, it said “596 dead. See page 4”. Other papers, such as the Daily , have effectively become mouthpieces for the government. In the end, the facts alone will not determine how this government is judged. It is an axiom of liberal thinking that with enough debate and discussion, the truth will eventually win out – that in the marketplace of ideas, the truest arguments eventually prevail over the loudest or most popular. But there is no discourse that is immune to the workings of power. And for now, this is still a powerful government: from the size of its majority to the circulation of its loyal partisan press. It has been the beneficiary of a stilted press briefing format that prevents follow-up questions, and it had the good luck to face a defeated opposition leader whose criticism of the government was largely ignored.The new occupant of that chair, Keir Starmer, has had a good start on challenging the government for its technical failures. But he has also succumbed to the faulty premise that “now is not the time” – resisting calls for an independent inquiry because the “priority” is that the government “fixes the current mistakes it is making”. As the picture of who is going to take the blame starts to come into focus, the question is not simply how to secure a future inquiry. If we do not prepare the ground for it now, we will find that by the time the moment for “taking stock” finally arrives, there will be little appetite for real accountability. When it’s all over, we will hear that there’s no point in fixing blame instead we will “learn lessons” for the future.This is the problem with “now is not the time” it ensures that the time for accountability will never arrive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2988c01c3da8ebd04f393f2b07177a61a13ddf93/0_410_5500_3299/master/5500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11cf357d4e1157389937ce5fdc400262","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of purple","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘purple’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘purple’.Share your photos of what purple means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 29 April at 10am.

Coronavirus-induced lockdown is changing the daily rhythm of urban life, shining a light on emboldened animals that usually prefer to remain hidden. Biologists and ecologists normally feel more at home studying remote jungles or inaccessible mountain tops, where “real” nature is. But as our planet gets covered with cities, more and more environments are being run by humans, who have become a super keystone species.This week, the \u0027s Age of Extinction site is looking at bioersity in cities and urban areas around the world, shining a spotlight on the under-appreciated world of nature hidden among the highrises and busy roads.The Covid-19 outbreak has seen cities and towns across the world go into lockdown which has enabled wildlife such as wild boar, deer, monkeys, foxes and even lions to venture into territory previously dominated by humans. It has also offered us the chance to notice and appreciate the natural world in cities in an unprecedented way.In this special series of reports we\u0027ll be looking at how animals and plants adapt to city life, what to look out for right now and how we can encourage more wild cities in the future.Cities are not mausoleums for nature but modern-day versions of the Galapagos archipelago, according to Menno Schilthuizen, author of Darwin Comes to Town, a book about contemporary evolution in cities where rapid changes can be observed within a human lifetime.“Only in our flights of fancy can we still keep nature orced from the human environment. Out in the real world, our tentacles entwine nature’s fabric,” Schilthuizen writes. “While we have been trying to save the world’s crumbling pre-urban ecosystems, we have been ignoring the fact that nature has already been putting up the scaffolds to build novel, urban ecosystems for the future.”Haunting images of wolves, bison and bears living in deserted towns following the 1986 Chernobyl disaster indicate what happens when humans leave a place for good. The coronavirus lockdown shows how quickly wildlife closes in. “It is interesting to consider how fragile our urban environment is. If we’re not constantly present, it’s being taken over by nature very quickly,” says Schilthuizen, who is professor of evolutionary biology at Leiden University in the Netherlands.The unique thing about coronavirus is that it is causing multiple cities across the globe to simultaneously go into hibernation. This gives ecologists an insight into how humans change urban bioersity in multiple locations. “Animals are nearby, constantly watching us from the outskirts and the forests, and as soon as our presence seems to be abating they start exploring where new terrain could be won … It makes you aware of how we’re constantly competing with many species,” says Schilthuizen.Historically, urban environments have been seen as too contaminated by humans to teach us anything important about bioersity. In the past few decades this has started to change but we still know little about the urban wildlife we live alongside, says Rana El-Sabaawi, associate professor of biology at Canada’s University of Victoria.“If you look in the literature, the field of urban ecology doesn’t really come into its own until the last decade or two. Before that there were a smattering of papers and reports, mostly descriptions of bioersity trends in and around specific cities. In recent years there has been a growing appreciation of the ecological mechanisms that explain bioersity in the city,” she says.Urban environments are messy places (full of lights, pollution and people pursuing their own interests), which makes studying them difficult. It’s all very well to observe animals and plants in urban places, but understanding how these different processes fit together is more problematic.At the same time, there is increasing recognition that few places on Earth are free from human influence – there is a plastic bag at the bottom of the Mariana  Trench, and Antarctica’s remote glaciers are flecked with microplastics. Understanding places where humans interact with nature most should help planners and developers create cities that hold as much wildlife as possible.Broadly speaking, “sensitive” species, whose habitat is destroyed by urban developments, are unlikely to venture into urban areas. “Opportunists”, which have a much broader diet and high tolerance for noise and pollution, are more at home. Coronavirus means species that might lie in the grey area between these categories are now more likely to venture into previously unexplored urban areas.Racoons, pigeons, foxes, gulls and crows are opportunists and considered a nuisance by many humans who live alongside them. Animals such as these, which scavenge human rubbish to get food, are likely to be struggling during lockdown.Ring-necked parakeets might disperse away from urban parks and forage on agricultural land instead. Residents of the East Riding in Yorkshire have been warned seagulls could be more aggressive because there are fewer seaside day-trippers feeding them leftover chips. In Amsterdam, even coots – which sometimes line their nests with plastic – may have a tough time finding replacement materials.“Often what happens when food supply runs short is increased competition and aggression between animals,” says El-Sabaawi. “There have already been fascinating reports from Asia about monkey ‘brawls’ caused by food shortages. If the food shortages are really severe and extended, then populations might decline.”Other animals seem to be doing well with fewer people on the street. Urban songbirds, for example, can communicate more easily when the din of background traffic is reduced. Deer, badgers and wild boar might be emboldened to start pinching food from suburban gardens or roadsides. A herd of goats has been running riot through the Welsh town of Llandudno, munching on people’s gardens as they go.Most researchers are agreed these species’ corona-related behavioural changes are temporary and the luxury of living in town will stop when humans re-emerge. Lockdown will probably have a similar effect on wildlife populations as an exceptionally wet or hot year – provided things return to how they were.Cities are also powerhouses for permanent changes. For example, there are distinct subspecies of mosquitoes found on the London underground that no longer hibernate and feed on human blood as opposed to bird blood, according to research published in Nature in 1999. Even more remarkable, mosquitoes living on different tube lines do not mix so the population living on the Circle line is genetically different to those living on the Piccadilly line. This change happened over 100 generations or so – significantly faster than Charles Darwin thought possible.Urban blackbirds are also morphing into a new species, according to Schilthuizen. Across European and north African cities, blackbirds living in urban areas have developed shorter bills (probably thanks to an abundance of bird feeders and easier pickings in cities). Traffic noise has caused urban blackbirds to sing in the night when it’s quieter, and they also breed around a month earlier than their countryside cousins.Scientists think the urban blackbird, Turdus urbanicus, could be the first of many species to adapt to life in the city. Schilthuizen writes: “The pace of evolution is set by ecological opportunities that emerge from human interactions … In those pressure cookers of environmental change, species will need to speed up their evolution or become extinct.”Changes in botany have been massive in the past decade with huge shifts in wild plants living in urban areas, according to London-based botanist Dr Mark Spencer. “Plants have lived with us in our cities for thousands of years and they move along with us and they tell stories about us,” he says.London is an important focal point for the arrival of non-native species in the UK, either arriving accidentally by international trade (via wool, for example) or escapees from domestic horticulture. Cities are the first pitstop for species that could later spread around the whole country.For example, loquat (a common cousin of plums, cherries and apricots) is becoming established in London where Greek and Turkish communities typically live because people spit out the pips on the ground after they’ve eaten the fruit. And now it’s starting to sprout in the wild.Widespread non-native plants such as Himalayan balsam, buddleia and Japanese knotweed were originally imported for horticulture. “The detailed research on the entry points of these well-established non-native species is not done,” says Spencer. “In this country, we have a focus on doing biological and ecological research on nice pristine chalk grasslands – which are wonderful habitats. We don’t like getting down and dirty with weird and wonderful street pavements. That’s pretty much it, putting it in crass terms. Urban areas are very poorly understood.”“Ordinary” urban areas are places we desperately need to understand, Spencer says. “A lot of this stuff is not about traipsing around recording hyper-rarities or incredible orchids, it’s about getting the common and the widespread.”People sending in samples of species can help researchers collect more accurate records about changes in botany. “One of the things we’ve been trying to do for the past decade or so in natural history is get past this idea that it’s elite, purely expert, frankly old, white, male, grey tops that can do it, and no one else can. Actually, the only way you get past this is by supporting people,” says Spencer, who encourages people to submit plant sightings to i-record.Will lockdown change how people interact with nature? Probably not, says Schilthuizen. “I’m enjoying the quiet. I keep thinking to myself, this is the way things should be, without constant air traffic overhead and without constant noise of traffic and throngs of people spending money on the streets … But I think we have a short memory. The bliss of a quiet period – or the memory of that period – will disappear quite quickly.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14d7962940433fb499bab4ff4445290c11b718c1/0_59_4264_2559/master/4264.jpg?width=980\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=14c19f4283991e3f399f94a1f2e8e55c 1960w","title":"no ifs no butts how the film industry is digitally revising its history splash daryl hannah","story":"Disney has hit a bum note by altering 80s comedy Splash. What other past movies have been sanitised without our knowledge?Hot on the heels of Cats’ digital dalliance with CGI nether regions comes another bum-related movie controversy: viewers have noticed some unsubtle changes to the mermaid romcom Splash as it appears on Disney+. There is a shot of Daryl Hannah ing into the sea, having just kissed a dumbstruck Tom Hanks. In the 1984 original, Hannah’s blond hair just about covers her naked bottom in the new version, that hair has been digitally extended to cover her entire buttock area – and badly at that. It looks as if she is wearing a hairy skirt. A forgotten 80s comedy may not be the hill most cinephiles would choose to die on, but we should still be concerned. What else is being altered without our knowledge?Retrospective tweaking to movies has been going on for decades but in the digital age it has become easier than ever to cover your tracks. Disney, especially, has been guilty of this, what with all the politically incorrect skeletons in its closet. You will not find the notorious Song of the South on Disney+ or the original, racist lyrics of Aladdin’s opening number. A sequence from the credits sequence of Toy Story 2 – where Stinky Pete propositions two Barbie dolls – has also been quietly removed. Elsewhere, Disney’s main concerns have been swearing, violence and particularly smoking hence the digital removal of cigarettes from both old cartoons and even photographs of Walt Disney (who was a heavy smoker). First they came for the cigarette butts, then they came for Daryl Hannah’s.Star Wars fans have become accustomed to this constant making-over. George Lucas added new CGI creatures to the 1997 reissue of A New Hope but also adjusted a crucial plot point. In one key scene, Han Solo kills the bounty hunter Greedo in cold blood. But in the re-edited version, he doesn’t: Greedo shoots first. Good luck finding the original “Han shoots first” version anywhere it is no longer commercially available.Disney is not alone here. In his 20th anniversary reissue of ET, Steven Spielberg substituted the clunky animatronic ET for a more convincing CGI model in some scenes (just wait till he gets around to Jaws), but he also digitally replaced the guns in the hands of the pursuing cops with walkie-talkies, thus softening the sentiment. (He has since backtracked and reinstated the guns.)There is a worrying air of propriety to Disney’s slashing of Splash. In the globalised marketplace of cultural taboos, we are in danger of sanitising everything to an absurd degree. Next it might put a nappy on Simba and a T-shirt over the Little Mermaid’s scallop-shell bikini. And, now that we are getting most of our content digitally, how do we know what was the “original” version anyway? Past movies can be tinkered with endlessly, in ways their creators never intended. Better to leave history as it was, butts and all.

But there is some comfort to be had in the stalls now filled with spring greens – the perfect ingredients for a risottoThere are 14 entrances to Testaccio’s covered market – usually. These days, just one is open, usually the one nearest the fish stalls, and it is overseen by a man who counts customers in up to 30, and after that operates a one-in, one-out system Gone are the swells of people, the jostling for position, the tickets flicked out of lanky dispensers now we are guided by masking-tape lines and firm instructions.When the first wave of measures were imposed on Rome, a short video of a man wearing a huge disc of cardboard around his middle (to signify the necessary safe distance) went viral. It was a father from my son’s school, and the market was Testaccio. This all seemed hilarious just over a month ago, but now it is normal – only we don’t need the cardboard to gauge the distance. Everyone is wearing masks and gloves, every counter has a pump dispenser ready to deliver servings of clear white sanitiser.Upsetting is the absence of Fillipo, the longest-standing fruit and vegetable vendor, who, since 1967 (then aged 14), has run a stall selling vegetables that he grows on his land an hour and a half outside Rome. For 54 years, Testaccio market has been Fillipo’s life and livelihood he is strong and fit enough to spend many more there. His wife, however, is neither strong nor well, which was the thing – the only thing, maybe – to convince him to leave. Many of his customers are worried and in a sort of mourning. Not that Fillipo would want anything so sentimental: “Vai da Marco” (“go to Marco”), he would say. Marco runs the stall opposite with his father.Spring marches on, and Marco’s stall is full of green these days: spinach, chard, chicory, lettuce, gangly broad beans, asparagus and peas wild and tame. Peas for everyone, every pod a gamble, charged with cannonballs that burst with flavour. Will we eat them all before they get anywhere near a pan? And who cares if we do? I always have frozen to hand and love them just as much – especially in a spring risotto. Spring – and spring risotto – marches on, hopefully.2 litres light chicken or vegetable stock, or salted water5 spring onions, diced2 small courgettes, quartered lengthways, then sliced into quarter moons7 tbsp olive oilSalt300g peas andor broad beans, fresh or frozen60g butter350g risotto rice (I use carnaroli)1 small glass of wine or vermouth60g parmesan, grated1 tbsp finely chopped herbsLemon zest, to tasteFirst get the stock ready: two litres of light chicken stock, vegetable stock, pea pod stock (which is made by simmering empty pea pods in water for an hour and straining) or simply salted water simmering gently in pan at the back of the cooker.Next, the vegetables: using whatever you have. On this occasion, I had spring onions (four for the vegetable stage, one for the rice stage later), two small courgettes and peas. Trim and slice the spring onions into rings – both the white and green bits – and cut the courgettes into four lengths, then into quarter moons.The vegetables are cooked separately. Start with the spring onion: stew four-fifths of it in three tablespoons of olive oil with a pinch of salt, thenadd the courgettes and peas.Stir for a couple of minutes, add a ladle of warm stock, then let the vegetables simmer, until tender with just a little liquid. The vegetables can now be pulled to one side and kept warm.In another pan, make the risotto. Warm a tablespoon of olive oiland half the butter over a medium heat until the butter foams. Add the remaining spring onion, and saute for a couple of minutes. Add the rice, stirring until every grain glistens, and is heated through.Add the wine, which should whoosh as it hits the pan, then stir until it has been absorbed. Start adding stock a ladleful at a time, stirring firmly and allowing it to be absorbed before adding the next. The process will take about 16 minutes after 12 minutes, stir in the vegetables.Turn off the heat, add the remaining butter and the parmesan, the herbs, and some lemon zest, if you wish.Cover the pan with a lid or a cloth, count to 60, then uncover and beat vigorously, until the risotto is creamy and glossy.

One concern in this regard is that the frequency of matches may increase the risk of potential injuries due to a player overload.“In light of this and the unique challenge faced globally in delivering competitions according to the originally foreseen calendar, Fifa proposes a larger number of substitutions be temporarily allowed at the discretion of the relevant competition organiser.“In competitions where less than five substitutions are currently allowed, each team would now be given the possibility to use up to five substitutions, with the possibility of an additional substitution remaining during extra time where relevant.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf7ed4027ba1ea172314e93b7ccd1d731182f197/0_145_3402_2042/master/3402.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3436110ef4bf94119eaf193ac83683d 645w","title":"calling her lifts my spirits three parents on isolation away from their children","story":"As the UK remains in lockdown, parents share their stories about how they’re connecting with their children via technology …With much of the world in lockdown, staying connected with our loved ones has never been more important. Whether we’re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from “nice to have” to the lifeline between us and the outside world.For some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar …Rosie: ‘I haven’t seen my son in four weeks’ “Dropping my son off with his father without knowing when I’m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I’ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn’t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old he’s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment – to hell with it all.“I have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I’ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.“It’s been four weeks already, which is the longest I’ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well – I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he’ll hug the phone he’s using.“He recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he’s being ‘independent’. He’s learned quite a few new words – I’m really proud of him. He’s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we’re reunited.“We talk at breakfast and dinner – it’s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.“We’ve also had some family group calls – we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!”Leo: ‘I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill’“When I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.“As the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn’t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I’m used to seeing her every few days.“We’ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.“My symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it’s best that she stays at her mum’s until I’m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don’t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn’t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.“It has been very hard to be away from her especially because we don’t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven’t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.“Loneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.“We chat about what we’re doing, laugh about how mad we’re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.”Mark: ‘We haven’t told my daughter I’m back in the UK yet’“I travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family – but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn’t be stranded.“After discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn’t come straight back to the family home and – as a precaution – I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.“However, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn’t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she’s been scared of things she’s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn’t want to worry her even more.“Every day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I’m away, and it’s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she’s coping and reassure her that I’ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.“It’s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we’ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.Instead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us more connected with each other. Thanks to strong internet networks and an array of digital apps and video communication software, we’re spending more quality time with loved ones, rehabilitating old relationships and forging new ones.

Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of crème de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there’s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.Online rendezvous: The Red (On)Lion: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra.

On ourselves, our relationships and what’s important to us. For some of us, that means reaching out to old friends, or healing old wounds with people we once thought we’d never speak to again. And in a way, the tech that helps us reconnect makes repairing those relationships easier: the screen gives us an element of safety, yet we can tap directly into those emotional connections we need to get us through this crisis.Here, three people who found isolation has had a positive effect on their relationships share their experiences – from building bridges, to creating the foundations for better communication, and reconnecting with family members they haven’t spoken to in years …Emma*: ‘Coronavirus gave me a reason to reach out to my brother’“I’d always had a good relationship with my brother, but it came crashing down last Christmas when my family discovered he’d been keeping his gambling addiction from us. He’d even taken money from Mum, and I was upset that he could put her through so much stress – I just couldn’t bring myself to speak to him. But after chatting to Mum over the past couple of weeks and hearing that he’d been helping her with food deliveries while she’s been in isolation, I decided to reach out. I sent him a text first and then he called me and we chatted about coronavirus and how we’ve been coping – a few days later, he FaceTimed me and gave me a tour of his new flat that I’ve never visited. I’d wanted to reach out to him before, but I was struggling to know how, so while lockdown is a very weird situation, it gave us both an excuse to push our differences to one side.“I also realised that life is too short – if my mum could move past what had happened, so could I. In fact, I’m probably speaking to him more now than I ever did before.”Michael: ‘Lockdown made me realise what’s important’“My ex-partner and I split a year ago and we share a young daughter, but our relationship has been really rocky ever since we broke up. We’d fight all the time and nasty words would be fired back and forth at each other over text message. But when the lockdown happened, it really made me take a step back and think about what’s important.“I reached out to her via text and also sent her some money for petrol, as she is driving our daughter between our two houses during this time – I wanted to make sure she knew I appreciated that she was helping me to see my daughter. It has felt like a real turning point for us and our relationship and it’s a really positive outcome from a situation that is out of our control. Now my daughter is with me and I’ve been sending my ex-partner pictures and we’ve been having civil conversations. Without this happening, I don’t know if we’d have ever reached this point.”Jo: ‘I’m connecting with family members I haven’t spoken to in years’“We have an extended family WhatsApp group made up of the descendants of my grandparents, both of whom sadly passed away recently. We used to use it every so often to share pictures from when people visited them, but over the years as inidual families grew, and as my grandparents got more frail, we didn’t have the same opportunities to gather together. And for some of the family, my only contact was an annual Christmas card. Since everyone has been staying at home for the past few weeks, though, the group has blown up with almost daily messages – pictures of the great-grandchildren doing their home school work, baking or learning to ride bikes without stabilisers in abandoned car parks.“My mum and dad both work in the NHS, with more than 60 years of service between them, so everyone shared videos from the 8pm clap for the NHS in recognition. And my brother, who’s a musician, livestreamed a gig on Facebook and lots of the family who’ve never had the opportunity to see him play before got to watch. It’s really lovely to feel connected to everyone, particularly as the two people that held us all together are no longer here.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedFamily has rarely felt more precious, nor has staying in touch with each other and the world.

Though they were made available to me, I shunned more traditional and more stable careers. Instead, I have continued, time and again, to try to be a writer, knowing full well this is not a stable choice. I simultaneously hoped for and attempted to create a stable life for our kids. I continued to attempt to perpetuate the illusion that I live the kind of life that people with more traditional jobs are able to afford – we kept living in New York, with two kids, kept trying to have health insurance and sometimes go to the dentist, kept trying to send our children to good public schools and summer camps.I wanted, in other words, to both be a writer and to live a life that cannot be sustained on the income of most writers. There are plenty of systemic failures in this country, but that miscue is solely mine. I always knew I’d have to have a second job, but again, I chose a path that offered no guarantee of stability. “Professor”, after all, used to mean some level of security, but now acquiring a tenure track position in academia has become something close to the equivalent of making it to the NBA. But I knew that going in.Stability has long been little more than fantasy, is what I’m saying. But since this crisis – since our precarity has turned to terror, then futility since the hole that we now find ourselves in has become too deep perhaps to ever claw our way back out – the absurdity of those delusions has become much more apparent. The shame I feel, toward all those years of pretending, is that much more pronounced.We’re living, as we have before, contingent on the generosity of others. I’m sitting in a house that is not mine, paying for an empty apartment that we can’t afford. My husband has been furloughed from the job he’d just started that made it possible for us to afford our rent. I got an email from my best paying job this week saying my class for the fall cannot be guaranteed until a couple of weeks before it starts. I desperately reach out to editors asking to write for them. I’ve thought of posting online about editing services, but the hole that we’re entering into is not something any single thousand dollar gig will fill.I keep thinking, what other forms can we imagine our lives into. My husband’s parents have a small camp in Maine that we could move to. There is no running water and no internet, the floors are not yet insulated, but also, there’s no rent. I could go back to teaching high school in a town that’s less expensive – in Florida, where we have family in more rural places, where the rents are more palatable, but then I’m not certified to teach public school.This crisis has highlighted how so much of our society is broken. It feels senseless, suddenly, to keep doing what we’ve always done. I know the institutions I am a part of are broken, top-heavy, do not care much for me, but they kept me afloat just enough – many of my bosses have been very kind – I was deluded enough, I guess, to stick around. It is that very American delusion which I would have said I’m not a part of, but I still was: the delusion that we do not denounce or depart the systems that exploit us, just in case, somehow, we find a way to achieve power within them.It is also an American delusion that if you stay within the systems you will maintain some level of safety, that stability will come, that a base level of certainty will exist. I met a guy a few months ago, who told me about being an adjunct professor at the same place for 17 years, and then being offered an entry level, non-tenure track, three-year job when he threatened to quit.As my husband and I have talked and thought more about leaving the lot of it – the city and our overpriced apartment, all my part-time gigs, his putting his head down in a few months and looking for work again – it’s become less and less clear what we’d lose if we left. We already don’t have health insurance. I have never had job security. Our community is the strongest and best part of our lives, but many of them have been laid low by this as well.New York will probably always be my favorite city. As exhausting and precarious as each is, I love every one of my jobs. We love our kids’ public school. But staring down the barrel of another decade of constant worry and part-time work and clawing our way out of the rubble of the second recession, it feels borderline insane to continue as we have.Next week still feels so far from this week. Right now, it’s hard to think much further than keeping everybody safe and sane. It’s hard to say what the other lives that we may try to make after this would look like. The tricky thing, always, about not having a lot of money, is that one seldom has much choice. But, for so long, we have been living as if we did not already know that we could not ever get to a place of solidity within the systems we’ve signed up for. Now that the absurdity of that delusion has been so thoroughly exhibited, it feels worth considering at least, what other shapes our lives may take."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a86040a472c3d049f87ace56fd0da7eab9c97fe/1107_249_4077_2446/master/4077.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23990cb636ccc036e35dd1ecdbb50d33","title":"how we met he played footsie with me under a coffee table in antarctica","story":"Keri Nelson, 45, is an administrator at a US Antarctic base. Alex Gough, 39, is a tech engineer in San Francisco. They met in Antarctica in 2009Ross Island is beautifully bleak. It is home to penguins, seals, volcanoes and two Antarctic research bases. Keri, who is American and works for the US Antarctic Program, was running the stores and other services at McMurdo station. Alex, a Briton who was doing a PhD in sea-ice physics, was 1.9 miles (3km) away at New Zealand’s Scott Base. They met in February 2009, as winter was approaching. But dating in Antarctica was tricky. “You don’t get your hopes up about anybody there,” says Alex. Isolated in a cold little bubble with a fairly transient community, people fall in and out of love quickly.There was a lot of interaction between the two bases, which is how they stumbled across each other – although neither remembers the exact moment. “If there was any big event happening at either base, it was made with the other station in mind. I would say at least once a month there would be something,” says Keri. Sometimes the two bases would play each other at volleyball. Alex sometimes noticed her at the bar. “But other people, too,” he says, and Keri laughs.The US base held a Fourth of July party. “I think we decided we should get to know each other a little bit more,” says Keri. They ended up talking for much of the night. “We came from really different backgrounds – I grew up on a farm in Minnesota and Alex went to grammar schools in England.” She remembers him “playing footsie with me under the coffee table”. At the end of the night, says Alex, “most people went home and I made the excuse that I didn’t really want to go back to Scott Base that night it was quite late”.Keri liked Alex’s intelligence: “I felt we were on the same wavelength.” Alex also appreciated how clever she was, “but in a different way” from him. “I’m a logical, science guy and Keri has these great insights into how people behave. She is a fascinating person. I think we just clicked and we keep surprising each other.”They got together that night. “We weren’t sure if anything else would happen, but I kept going to see Keri and Keri kept coming to see me,” says Alex. They would meet a couple of times a week, with Alex usually making the relatively short (but sometimes -40C) trek between the stations, often in snow storms, or kite-skiing across the sea ice – because Keri had lettuce. “Lettuce is valuable down there,” says Keri. “We had a greenhouse at McMurdo station, so I would take my share and save it until Alex came over and we would sit on the couch and eat it.”He would bring her small presents – gingerbread men, a stuffed elephant. When you pack for a stint in Antarctica, many people bring small gifts to give to their friends and colleagues whenever they need a little lift. “Keri got most of them,” he says.Sometimes they would both set out from their respective bases at the same time and meet in the middle. “The auroras would be going off above our head, so we would watch that together,” says Keri. “We found patches of snow and pretended we were penguins and slid down the hill. It was very cute and almost makes me want to barf.” She laughs. “I don’t think either of us were really serious about each other at that point. It was just an Antarctica winter thing that was happening.”Once their time there was over, Keri went back to the US and Alex to university in New Zealand, so they started a long-distance relationship. Keri returned to work in Antarctica the following winter, still not sure if their relationship would work long-term, but there was no pressure from either of them. “The idea that we were probably going to break up meant that if we didn’t feel like breaking up, that was cool, too,” she says. Alex says: “It was always worth waiting for Keri.” They got married five years ago and now live in San Francisco.Their longest stint together has been 14 months most years, Keri goes back to Antarctica for about six months. Video calls from the base are rationed, but they keep in daily contact by phone and messages. “It was always expected that Keri would keep doing this, so we both understand the situation we’re in,” says Alex. It helps that they are independent people, says Keri. “We both haven’t cared very much about the way things are ‘supposed’ to be. We like our alone time.” Then, says Alex, “you meet each other again and you get to fall in love again”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0d67f09e5c6e0a15b49a6bffdf676b8dd552dec/0_0_5354_3213/master/5354.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d0bdc4a3f2469a71a1b94b3cb5cd395","title":"i love my partner but he always feigns ignorance of household chores","story":"He is an intelligent man, who has no reason to make childish domestic queries. Does he do this simply because I am a woman?I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for four years and we are getting married next year. It is a really good relationship and we are very happy. However, he often asks me silly domestic questions, which he could easily work out for himself and in most cases knows the answer to anyway, such as: “Where is the dishwasher powder?” and, ”How long does pasta take to cook?”He is a grown man of 37 and is very accomplished in his life and career, so I can’t understand why he regresses into this childish state where he thinks I should give him the answer to all domestic queries, aside from the obvious fact that I’m a woman.When I ask him to work it out for himself he gets angry and it turns into a horrible fight.

There are still lots of people dying, but people are desperate for a bit of light relief. It’s about striking the balance right.”Advertisers are struggling to work out how to promote their products during an age of physical distancing, walking the tightrope between continuing to sell goods where possible, building their brands, and trying not to look insensitive.Already there are a few basic rules of thumb that are changing how advertising looks. Footage of people socialising outside the home is out, as it may look jarring to audiences in lockdown adverts that resemble Zoom calls are in, but may already be a cliche and everyone’s trying to work out how to create new promotions without being allowed outside.“The number one thing advertisers are worried about is getting the right tone,” said Kelly Williams, ITV’s commercial boss. “People will remember how you behave during the crisis. We’re finding advertisers who can’t trade still looking to spend some money to keep their voice.”“Television advertising over the next couple of months will be as cheap as it ever has been,” said Williams, who said he had seen signs that some companies were starting to spend again. Until then, he said, audiences should to expect to see the same adverts more often, especially promotions for telecoms, charities, groceries and online shopping.Necessity has forced innovation, with ITV producing more material in-house and companies turning promotions on their heads. “Some advertisers are having to edit what they’ve got. McCain have got this lovely family campaign narrated by Ricky Tomlinson. They kept the same ad but got Ricky Tomlinson to change the voiceover.”The Co-op cancelled its Easter TV advertising campaign, which was originally promoting chocolate eggs, and donated millions of pounds of airtime to run an advert featuring supermarket staff urging people to support the food charity FareShare.Cathedral City created an advert about the joys of sitting at home with a cheese toastie by splicing together footage from old adverts and putting a new soundtrack over the top. Tesco promoted its Easter food sales by showing a video of a family holding a video conference to discuss how best to cook lamb.Jameson said many big-budget campaigns had been scrapped and her team were desperately trying to think of formats that could be produced in lockdown, with drone footage of empty streets suddenly popular. She predicted that television screens and online video services would soon be filled with adverts produced using animation, which can be produced remotely.“Advertisers who just running pre-corona stuff looks really weird,” she said. “You see ads for beer, which of course people are still going to want to drink, but somehow it just feels odd to see people in a pub at the moment.”Many companies have taken it upon themselves to promote stay-at-home messages, although there is a risk that people are baffled when companies that normally sell them beer or clothes start telling them how to stay safe in a pandemic.With ad spending collapsing, the government has stepped into the void with its big-budget national public health campaign, which has become ubiquitous – especially on news websites.“You need a short, informative message to get the public’s attention, certainly to resonate with younger audiences today,” said Jeremy Hine, the chief executive of MullenLowe Group UK, which has created the campaign. “‘Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives’ is like a wartime version.”Following the prime minister’s calls to evoke a blitz spirit, the campaign has been designed to evoke the spirit of the second world war, when the public were told that “coughs and sneezes cause diseases” and the never released “Keep calm and carry on” poster was created.However, Hine said brands should leave the evocation of war to the government and instead focus on reassuring the public with their advertising messages.“Being Churchillian is fine for politicians – a rallying cry to lead and set policy, it makes for a powerful, engaging ad campaign,” he said. “But that approach is less meaningful for a brand. Advertisers that are doing it well out there are those like McCain’s ‘staying at home’ work, or PG Tips with the idea of sharing a cup of tea over Skype. They are putting an arm around you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5b53dc7e6acd023fe02cf31dedbf1903c46c025/0_163_5100_3062/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11c9ea8738e4c32579954eeb391f1f08","title":"were stuck paying rent on a property we cant move into","story":"After finding a buyer for our home we decided to rent, but after lockdown we have to stayQ My husband and I are in our 70s. We were in the process of moving home to be nearer family who currently live about four hours’ drive away.Initially, we wanted to rent and signed up for a tenancy in the middle of March. We had a buyer for our house, and had booked a removals firm for early April, knowing that the sale would not be completed until a month or so after we had moved to the rented property.Our removals company closed down once lockdown was announced, and has refunded our money. We have had to put the sale on hold, as we had not exchanged contracts, but we know the buyers still want to buy our house.We are now a bit stuck. We are living in the house we still own but still paying rent on the other property, although the landlords have reduced what we have to pay. The first time we visited the rental property we took a few things with us and those are still there. We are not sure whether our move would be considered essential, and who decides whether it is? The main thing stopping us actually moving is finding removers. The British Association of Removers has advised companies to close down. At our age we cannot hire a van and do it ourselves.Until social distancing is relaxed we cannot see how removers are going to be able to work, as moving wardrobes, chests of drawers and so on is always going to take two people. We cannot see how we can move in the foreseeable future, but are stuck paying rent for a property we cannot live in.ARA The main thing stopping you moving is that the government has said that “homebuyers and renters should, where possible, delay moving to a new house while measures are in place to fight coronavirus”.To be permitted to move – and so not be subject to the new emergency enforcement powers given to the police – the move would have to be unavoidable because you have not been able to agree a new date for moving. So even if you could find a removal firm willing to help, you shouldn’t go ahead with it because it is not unavoidable.In addition, the government has said that people who have two or more homes “must remain in their primary residence” which, in your case, is the home you own. The government has also made it clear that “essential travel does not include visits to second homes, camp sites, caravan parks or similar, whether for isolation purposes or holidays”.So it looks like you will not be able to move until the lockdown ends. In the meantime, you should keep in touch with your landlord. It sounds as though they are behaving reasonably, but if they do try to charge full rent before you are allowed to move in it may be worth pointing out that there is no wear and tear while you are not living there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbccbbac803d7c77825297df6c8af0ee347bbf0a/0_250_8170_4902/master/8170.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c2c95fcd28fbf4e9ff3ce0ec0b4d4ac","title":"why did ryanair stop refunds and start offering only vouchers","story":"At first it said it would give the money back, but then it said this would only be after the coronavirus crisisWe booked Ryanair flights to Malta in March which, of course, had to be cancelled. At the end of March Ryanair promised us that our request for a full refund would be processed within 20 working days, with the money paid up to 10 days later.Today we received an email which seems to only offer replacement vouchers. In the small print, Ryanair states that it will only consider refunds after the Covid-19 emergency is over. Can I hold Ryanair to its original promise?Readers have been contacting us in their droves this week asking exactly the same question. Having previously said it would offer refunds – and unlike the other airlines put in place a website to make it happen – Ryanair has now changed its mind.Instead of the refund, passengers have been sent a link telling them how to use its vouchers to purchase alternative flights over the next 12 months. They can still request a cash refund, it states, but will be placed “in the cash refund queue until the Covid-19 emergency has passed”.Readers are understandably frustrated and, in many cases, very angry. The rules are clear: full refunds are due if the airline cancels the flight, to be processed within seven working days.Clearly, the easiest option is to take the vouchers. But be aware that they are, inexplicably, only valid for 12 months.If you would prefer, or need, the money, apply to be put into the queue and see how it develops. Sooner or later, regulators are going to have to get involved in this dispute.In my view, the Civil Aviation Authority needs to give the airlines a month to start making refunds, and to warn those that don’t that they will have their licences to operate in and out of UK airports, withdrawn. However, the CAA does not have a great record in this area.If the emails sent to us are anything to go by, consumer patience over this issue is starting to wear rather thin.We welcome letters but cannot answer inidually.

We kick it off with postmodern pop, fierce camp and timeless rock’n’roll. Check back weekdays for more picks – and see if you agreeby  Ben Beaumont-Thomas,  Alexis Petridis and  Laura SnapesAs the coronavirus lockdown continues, the ’s music desk thought you might be in need of a distraction – something to send you down memory lane, or to ert the annoyance at your housemates or children on to us. We present to you a ranking of the 100 greatest UK No 1 singles since the charts began in 1952.We’ll be counting this down over six weeks – for the first two weeks, we’ll spend Monday to Thursday counting down 10 at a time. That takes us up to the Top 20, and from Monday to Friday for four weeks we’ll have standalone celebrations of each remaining song by our team of critics.This list, and the songs’ order, was compiled via a politely raging video call between me, chief rock and pop critic Alexis Petridis and deputy music editor Laura Snapes. The ranking isn’t based on sales or longevity, it’s the fruit of that discussion: what we as critics, fans and lifetime listeners think are the most brilliant songs to top the UK charts, and, of those, which are more brilliant than others. The only rule was that an artist could only feature once.As such, it is very much open to discussion, which we heartily encourage in the comments section. We’d love to hear what you think of our choices – whether in agreement or outrage – and hear your fond or not-so-fond memories of these singles. After we’ve reached No 1, we’ll ask what you think we unforgivably missed out from the overall list, and then publish highlights from your selections. Also, note that dates listed are the dates the songs reached No 1.You could spend years arguing about what constitutes the first rock’n’roll record. Rock Around the Clock patently isn’t it, but it was, incontrovertibly, the record that brought rock’n’roll to mainstream attention in the UK: two minutes of music that sounded infinitely more feral than its avuncular artist looked and that changed pop music for ever. APBy disavowing the hollow opulence and bloated scale of pop’s reigning class, Lorde accidentally ushered in a brand new one: there would be no Billie Eilish if not for her conspiratorial incantations. While she weathered accusations of appropriation for disavowing hip-hop cliches in her obviously rap-influenced delivery, she ultimately echoed the genre’s own move towards unvarnished portrayals of teenage disaffection instigated by a parallel wave of SoundCloud upstarts. As much a generational bellwether as a pop classic. LSRecorded in a Coventry front room, Mouldy Old Dough sounds like pop music made by people who have never actually heard pop music, but have had it described to them by someone who didn’t really know what they were talking about: pub piano, growled vocals, a beat that recalls a drunk doggedly staggering home. The weirdness of 70s Britain in musical form. APIf you wanted evidence of how far out, how unbound by the usual rules reggae was, you could find it at the top of the charts in early 1971: a piano line taken – sampled if you like – from Ramsey Lewis a vocalist who largely grunted and bellowed incomprehensibly in the style of a Jamaican deejay: “I am the magnificent W-O-O-O!” It still sounds fantastic. APThe pinnacle of Roy Orbison’s career as rock’s great tragedian: three astonishing, inconsolable minutes during which stars cry, rainbows weep, golden days are sorrowfully recalled and drums beat a leaden funeral march, before it all reaches a terrible climax, Orbison desperately repeating the title as if misery is a kind of catharsis. APIt won’t be too much of a spoiler to reveal that this is the only No 1 single in this list that concerns how the brutally uncaring nature of new technology can paradoxically deepen nostalgia while rendering the past irrelevant. Trevor Horn and co turned this material into postmodern gold, building jingles, prog, orchestral pop and more into a screwball fantasy. That cold steady kick drum, meanwhile, is like techno kicking the door down to take over pop culture. BBTAfter a fitfully successful start, this was the song to turn the Kosovan-British pop singer into a global star. You can almost feel her clamp a hand on your shoulder as she adopts a stern, schoolmarmish tone to dispense those rules for breakup survival: don’t answer your ex’s calls, let them pop round or even be their friend. She’s not telling us or her mates, though, but rather herself, making for a powerful pop psychodrama. BBTBehind the simple, perky rock’n’roll facade – “the ultimate fairground anthem”, as writer Bob Stanley put it – there’s something disturbing about Del Shannon’s biggest hit: an eeriness about the rumble of the opening guitar chords and the echoing keyboard solo, a sense the vocal is slightly too impassioned and pained. The result is as compelling a single as 1961 produced. APHad These Boots Are Made for Walkin’ been sung by a man, as its author, Lee Hazlewood, had intended, it would just have been nasty. Sung with insouciant cool by the recently orced Nancy Sinatra, however, it became something else entirely: camp but tough, funny but fierce, completely irresistible. APSaturday Night just pipped Gina G’s Ooh Aah … Just a Little Bit to our 90s Eurobanger slot. First off, it’s an actual Eurobanger (not an Aussie impersonator), and like the Village People’s YMCA, it has a dance routine invented by fans that came to define the song. It’s got an immediately iconic tag (“dee dee da da da!”), plus it was the victor in one of pop’s funniest plagiarism cases: I want some of whatever the person who thinks this sounds like Lindisfarne’s Fog on the Tyne was having.

In today’s roundup, a near centenarian is expected to receive an honour for raising millions of pounds for the NHS, while a postman goes out of his way to deliver a vaguely labelled parcel.A six-month old baby who was born with a heart condition has beaten coronavirus after spending two weeks on a high dependency unit.Nurses and doctors at Alder Hey children’s hospital in Liverpool formed a guard of honour for Erin Bates as she was moved from isolation to another ward to continue her recovery on Friday.Erin, from Bury, underwent open heart surgery shortly after birth. She will continue to receive treatment for ongoing conditions at the hospital.Her mother, Emma Bates, thanked the NHS workers who looked after Erin, describing them as “truly amazing”.The 99-year-old who has raised nearly £29m for the NHS by walking 100 lengths of his garden has reportedly made it on to the honours shortlist.Captain Tom Moore, who has also topped the UK singles charts with his cover of You’ll Never Walk Alone, could receive a CBE after thousands of people nominated him.The war veteran from Bedfordshire completed the laps of his garden before his 100th birthday on Thursday.The money he has raised will go to NHS Charities Together to support staff and volunteers working on the frontline during the coronavirus pandemic.A postman managed to track down the person a parcel was intended for, even though it was addressed only to “somewhere in Sheffield”.Darrell Gilmour, 56, turned to social media to find David Easson’s whereabouts after being handed the parcel with a description of him written next to the vague address.He found Easson, a sports radio presenter, on Facebook and was able to deliver the package containing a gift of Scandinavian chocolate from a fan in Sweden.Marten Wedebrand, who sent the parcel, told the Yorkshire Post he had written down all the details he knew about Easson, including that he had “a child, a dog, or both.”Tour buses that would usually ferry music stars to venues across the country have been handed over for use as “hotels on wheels” for NHS workers.Tarrant Anderson, who runs the touring company Vans For Bands, told the BBC that the industry was “on its knees” during the lockdown, but he had moved to help after seeing pictures of exhausted doctors and nurses on social media.After being checked over to make sure the buses met lockdown guidelines and NHS health and safety standards, they were stationed in hospital car parks to offer respite to staff."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c052ae59b45fd61db93ea75206adeecf21442966/0_130_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dcadff0ea56d4607da9783caf5ceab2","title":"surviving icu a story of recovery podcast","story":"Dave Lewins is a healthy, 60-year old helicopter pilot, who in March found himself in intensive care with Covid-19.

And of course, homeless people cannot simply stay home.”He highlighted how the most vulnerable populations had been neglected, which “forces them to continue working in unsafe conditions, putting everyone’s health at risk.” And he warned that, while some nations were seeing curves flattening, the virus was “poised to wreak havoc in poorer countries”.“As for the UK,” Alston told the , “my thoughts of course hark back to the sense of how utterly hypocritical it is now to abandon ‘austerity’ with such alacrity, after all the harm and misery caused to iniduals and the fatal weakening of the community’s capacity to cope and respond over the past 10 years.“And of course, many of the worst and most damaging aspects of ‘austerity’ cannot and will not be undone. The damage caused to community cohesion and to the social infrastructure are likely to prove permanent.”His comments are likely to anger ministers in the UK, who have said their strategy is to put their “arms around every single worker” while adopting an “everyone in” policy to tackle the risk to rough sleepers. They have sanctioned huge cash injections into wages and businesses to prevent economic collapse, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak announced £14bn for the NHS and local authorities fighting the virus.But other parts of the social fabric have been stretched. Food banks, which give out at least 1.6m parcels a year, have lacked supplies while care homes, where thousands are dying from Covid-19, have struggled for essentials including PPE and to maintain staffing levels. There have been real-terms cuts in public funding of social care in the UK, according to the King’s Fund thinktank, with a £700m reduction between 2011 and 2018.“This pandemic has exposed the bankruptcy of social support systems in many countries.” Alston said. “While some governments have embraced far-ranging measures previously dismissed as unrealistic, most programmes have been short-term, stop-gap measures that merely buy time rather than address the immense challenges that will continue well into the future. Now is the time for deep structural reforms that will protect populations as a whole and will build resilience in the face of an uncertain future.”A government spokesperson said: “We have a strong record on supporting hardworking people across the country as well as our most vulnerable, reaching record employment over the last ten years and with both income inequality and absolute poverty lower than in 2010.“These are unprecedented times and it’s right that we do everything we can to support people through this difficult period, including increasing Universal Credit by up to £1,040 over a year.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6520e87489ed917158f9d1316de3eef690deb3ad/0_224_4325_2596/master/4325.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06da79909958acb5ea346894b18edecf","title":"pompeii ruins show that the romans invented recycling","story":"Excavations reveal that rubbish left outside the city walls wasn’t just dumped. It was being collected, sorted and resoldThey were expert engineers, way ahead of the curve on underfloor heating, aqueducts and the use of concrete as a building material. Now it turns out that the Romans were also masters at recycling their rubbish.Researchers at Pompeii, the city buried under a thick carpet of volcanic ash when Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD, have found that huge mounds of refuse apparently dumped outside the city walls were in fact “staging grounds for cycles of use and reuse”.Professor Allison Emmerson, an American academic who is part of a large team working at Pompeii, said rubbish was piled up along almost the entire external wall on the city’s northern side, among other sites. Some of the mounds were several metres high and included bits of ceramic and plaster, which could be repurposed as construction materials.These mounds were previously thought to have been formed when an earthquake struck the city about 17 years before the volcano erupted, Emmerson said. Most were cleared in the mid-20th century, but some are still being discovered.Scientific analysis has now traced some of the refuse from city sites to suburban deposits equivalent to modern landfills, and back to the city, where the material was incorporated into buildings, such as earth floors.With fellow archaeologists Steven Ellis and Kevin Dicus, who worked on the University of Cincinnati’s excavations, Emmerson has studied how the ancient city was constructed. “We found that part of the city was built out of trash. The piles outside the walls weren’t material that’s been dumped to get rid of it. They’re outside the walls being collected and sorted to be resold inside the walls.”Pompeii was a city of elegant villas and handsome public buildings, open squares, artisan shops, taverns, brothels and bathhouses. It included an amphitheatre that hosted gladiatorial games for audiences of up to 20,000.When volcanic dust from Vesuvius “poured across the land” – as one witness wrote – enveloping the city in darkness, at least 2,000 people died. In 1748, a group of explorers discovered the almost perfectly preserved city under a hardened carpet of ash and pumice. Even a loaf of bread was found preserved by later archaeologists.Pompeii is now a Unesco world heritage site and – in normal times – attracts 2.5 million visitors each year.Emmerson and her colleagues used soil samples to trace the movement of rubish across the city. “The soil that we excavate differs based on where the garbage was left originally,” she said. “Garbage dumped in places like latrines or cesspits leaves behind a rich, organic soil. In contrast, waste that accumulated over time on the streets or in mounds outside the city results in a much sandier soil.“The difference in soil allows us to see whether the garbage had been generated in the place where it was found, or gathered from elsewhere to be reused and recycled.”Some walls, for example, included reused materials such as pieces of tile and broken amphorae, and lumps of mortar and plaster. “Almost all such walls received a final layer of plaster, hiding the mess of materials within,” she said.“The idea has been that all this garbage resulted from that earthquake – consisting of rubble that had been cleared out of the city and dumped outside the wall to remove it from daily life. As I was working outside Pompeii, I saw that the city extended into developed neighbourhoods outside the walls ... So it didn’t make sense to me that these suburbs were also being used as landfills.”Modern approaches to waste management focus on removing rubbish from our daily lives, she added. “For the most part, we don’t care what happens to our trash, as long as it’s taken away. What I’ve found in Pompeii is an entirely different priority, that waste was being collected and sorted for recycling.“The Pompeians lived much closer to their garbage than most of us would find acceptable, not because the city lacked infrastructure and they didn’t bother to manage trash but because their systems of urban management were organised around different principles.“This point has relevance for the modern garbage crisis. The countries that most effectively manage their waste have applied a version of the ancient model, prioritising commodification rather than simple removal.”Allison Emmerson, who teaches classical studies at Tulane University, New Orleans, is the author of Life and Death in the Roman Suburb to be published next month by Oxford University Press."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/160fe9c5fc86e28c32bcff2d2b986dd26ae2c19b/0_216_5720_3433/master/5720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bc6a2e61364ff57c37f95045f706f28","title":"uk tourism hotspots could face worst of post lockdown job losses","story":"Economic burden of Covid-19 likely to be spread unevenly across country, say researchers People working in some of Britain’s most beautiful areas will be worst hit by the expected wave of unemployment following the coronavirus pandemic, according to forecasts suggesting the economic burden of Covid-19 is set to be spread unevenly.Workers in the tourism-driven economies of the Lake District, Cornwall and the beauty spots of Yorkshire are at the highest risk of being left jobless, according to research by the Royal Society of Arts and Manufacturing.People living in London, south-east England and the knowledge economies of Oxford and Cambridge are the least likely to lose their livelihoods, the study says.Nearly 27,000 jobs are at risk in Pembrokeshire and the Cotswolds alone. Many of the areas facing the biggest job losses are in Conservative heartlands. Last week Visit Britain estimated that Covid-19 would cost the tourism industry around £15bn in 2020, with 22 million fewer visitors to the UK.“Our analysis finds a stark geographical ide in terms of how Covid-19 could impact local labour markets with rural areas and coastal towns most at risk of high job losses,” said the report’s authors, Fabian Wallace-Stephens and Alan Lockey. “Many of the most vulnerable areas are located in the north and south-west of England. Cities and other urban areas tend to be at less risk, particularly in London or in its surrounding commuter belt.”The RSA found that younger workers aged 16 to 24 were more than twice as likely to be furloughed as middle-aged workers.A separate study, also published on Monday, says black and minority ethnic citizens will find the coming economic conditions hardest to weather because they have much less money saved to fall back on.The Runnymede trust found that for every £1 of wealth and savings held by white British citizens, Pakistani households have about 50p, black Caribbean households about 20p and black African and Bangladeshi households approximately 10p.There is increasing evidence that black and minority ethnic people are disproportionately represented among the victims of the coronavirus, with many Asian doctors, nurses and taxi drivers among those known to have died.“As well as the cost in life of Covid-19, economic gaps in society are being exposed and even widened, and the effects may last for a generation, affecting ethnic minorities particularly,” said Omar Khan, the director of the Runnymede Trust.“During this lockdown, children are being educated at home and some adults are working from home. Many are having to dip into savings, but little consideration is given to those who have no savings to fall back on are not able to work from home and have no IT equipment or not enough space to effectively school their children.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e22d15c849de45d879f47e85f4a95d1fe0a7ddbd/56_403_3216_1930/master/3216.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7f37e574487b8e567dfc0d79a2104e8c","title":"womens six nations looks to move in rugby calendar increase exposure","story":"The Six Nations schedule is set for a radical overhaul, with organisers considering creating a new window for the women’s competition to avoid clashing with the men’s tournament, moving it away from the traditional February-March slot in an effort to increase exposure.There was widespread criticism of the schedule for this year’s tournament from, among others, the England fly-half Katy Daley-Mclean, with a number of the matches shoehorned into lunchtime kick-offs, often overlapping each other. Similarly, there have been problems with women’s matches staged on the same day as the men’s - often in different cities – ensuring supporters are not able to attend both.There was also considerable disbelief at the decision to stage France v England – effectively the title decider – on the opening weekend of the 2020 tournament. That match, won 19-13 by England, attracted a bumper crowd of 14,000 while 11,000 saw them thrash Wales on 7 March at the Stoop.This year was the second in a row organisers failed to attract a title sponsor for the women’s championship. There is no prize money either while £16m is available in the men’s tournament, and there is a growing sense that a new window would help resolve that. The most recent World Cup, in August 2017, gives an idea of the audiences available to a standalone women’s competition. The final attracted a peak audience of 2.6m on ITV.“We are studying a possible specific window different to the men’s as part of an update to the global calendar for the women’s international game,” said a Six Nations spokesperson. “This is a working option right now, no decision is made yet.”It is understood the proposal was being considered before the coronavirus pandemic but the disruption could accelerate the move when rugby returns. The women’s calendar has already been disrupted by the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics to 2021. There are just six weeks between the end of the Games and the start of the World Cup in New Zealand and far more women move between sevens and XVs than in the men’s game.Firstly, however, the 2020 Six Nations needs to be completed. England, with four wins from four, are the champions elect with Italy left to play, but six matches need to be rescheduled owing to the coronavirus outbreak."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4267654a948af234036b507a646ae88b9b911ced/0_227_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfebae43d70c430a2e876f6e018e351e","title":"how to avoid amazon the definitive guide to online shopping without the retail titan","story":"Amazon’s sales have hit £8,800 a second, while concerns persist about its tax affairs, treatment of staff and effect on small retailers. Here’s how to buy everything from technology to beauty to books without itWith the shutters down on high streets and retail parks around the world, meaning that home delivery is the only option for almost anything other than food and medicine, it’s no surprise that Amazon is seeing business boom. The online retailer, already a one-stop shop for many people, has seen customers flock through its virtual doors in the weeks since coronavirus hit.The site is experiencing an extended period of sales at the level usually reserved for the shopping frenzy of Black Friday, with reported surges reaching $11,000 (£8,800) a second. Its share price is booming, too, making its already rich founder, Jeff Bezos, even richer.But while the site offers everything you could need at the moment, from food to films, via fish tanks and photo frames, there are many who feel uncomfortable about adding to its dominance. Concerns about its treatment of workers, how little tax it pays and its impact on smaller retailers are not new, but this crisis has shone the spotlight on them again.In the US, some Amazon workers are protesting against their treatment, accusing the company of putting revenue above safety by not supplying enough face masks or checking that employees are not sick when they turn up to work.In December, the UK campaign group Fair Tax Mark put Amazon at the top of a list of companies that it said were “aggressively avoiding” tax, saying it had paid just $3.4bn in tax on revenues of $960.5bn and profits of $26.8bn. With countries needing to rebuild their finances after the crisis, attention is likely to fall on corporations that are not seen to be paying their fair share.It is also worth remembering that however quick the delivery might be, it is not always as handy as being able to go to a shop and bring something home straight away. We will, one day, be back to that situation, so it is worth protecting your local retailers in the short term if you can. It is also worth looking for online alternatives.John Lewis is offering free standard delivery on orders over £50 or next-day delivery for £6.95. It is not offering two-person deliveries, and is calling ahead to check whether customers are self-isolating. Orders can be delivered to Waitrose, Co-op and Booths stores, too.It is worth seeing if independent retailers near you are still operating. In Carlisle, for example, @Home PC is advertising contact-free delivery on laptops and accessories.Depop is like eBay, but for trendy clothing and beauty products. The platform has listings from a range of inidual sellers and stores, and there are star ratings so you can choose to buy from trusted sellers. Purchases are protected by PayPal. It’s hard to avoid Amazon if you want to watch something that it has bought the rights for, but for films and music there are many other options.The BFI has new and classic films to rent on its website. One-off rentals start at £2.50 each, or a subscription offers older films. That costs £4.99 a month, but there is a 14-day free trial at the start.Curzon is offering the cinema experience at home, with very recent films such as Portrait of a Lady on Fire available to stream for less than £10. You don’t need to subscribe to watch, and there is a free film when you register your details.Cinema Paradiso has a wider range of films and TV programmes, but this is a DVD rental service so you can’t watch straight away. Again there is a 14-day free trial the monthly cost depends on which subscription you choose. The basic one is £5.99 and offers two rentals a month.HMV does most of its business online these days, too, and is another option if you don’t need to watch something straight away.Last week, Amazon was revealed to be the mystery donor of £250,000 to a fund to help bookshops suffering hardship. The organisers welcomed the gesture, while also noting that there was still “no greater threat to high-street bookselling” than the US giant.Books are in fact some of the easiest items to find a good alternative source for. Many independent shops are offering deliveries – a lot will order titles for you even if they don’t have them in stock. You can find local shops via the Booksellers Association’s website.For ebooks, there’s nowhere other than Amazon to buy Kindle versions, but there are other options. Many libraries, for instance, are offering loans online – check out your local council’s website for details. It is possible to convert ebooks bought elsewhere to Kindle’s format using free software such as Calibre.Through Indiebound, readers in the US can search for and buy from independent booksellers. You can search by zip code or store name – in case you are looking to support a particular store. Speed and cost of shipping depends on the bookstore.

The photographer, a Hungarian aristocrat who had given up a career as a diplomat to become a journalist, had based himself in the city after the war. Most often in this period – as a new book of his work, Paris, reveals – his camera dwelt on the lightness of the city as it reinvented itself: lovers dancing by the Seine, little visions of serendipitous comedy or grace in bars and cafes. The formal geometries of this photograph – which captures the Filles de la Charité of the order of St Vincent de Paul – is unusual in this work.Social distancing was, and is, a way of life for the nuns, popularly known as the “grey sisters”, who were required to take four annual vows of poverty, chastity and obedience in the service of the poor. The absence of shadow from the figures suggests that Almasy found his vantage to look into the courtyard at around noon, when the nuns were required to meditate and examine their consciences. The singular dress of the order, the white linen head-dress or cornette – prototype PPE – was established at the time of their foundation in the 17th century.In some ways, this photograph gave an indication of the future direction of Almasy’s work. Later that year, he became an official photographer for the United Nations, working in particular for the World Health Organization, for which over the following decades he produced hundreds of stories, capturing the success and failure of fighting disease across the globe. By the time of his death in 2003, aged 97, he had gathered an archive of 120,000 pictures, always using a diplomat’s discretion: “When I took photographs I never crouched down like a cat about to pounce on its prey,” he said. “I never attacked with my camera.” Paris by Paul Almasy is published in May (teNeues, £12.50)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aeb9f9759697bdd4ab8f4326c959646d73ef4da8/0_300_4960_2976/master/4960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1e26984e48b8b007f064d7abbdb5c6f","title":"postcard from future i dream of swimming berlins pristine lakes","story":"A short U-bahn ride from the German capital lie lakes, waterways and beaches that Rory MacLean can’t wait to swim in once againAt home in locked-down Dorset, I look out of my study window. Beyond the horizon I imagine launching myself on wild journeys: trekking Nepal’s high Annapurna trail or paddling a canoe across the dark mirror of a Canadian lake and leaving a trail of twisting whirlpools in my wake. In our changing new age, and with the need to limit long-haul air travel, I know that I’ll never reach many of my fancied, far afield destinations. Yet I’m determined to get back outdoors as soon as possible, starting in Berlin.To the west of the city – starting at the end of the U3 U-Bahn line – spreads a lattice of pristine lakes and waterways: urban Krumme Lanke and Schlachtensee, narrow Templiner See with dozens of intimate beaches, idyllic Lake Glienicke, which was once cut in half by the Berlin Wall.In the Havelseengebiet nature reserve, just south of Potsdam, water flows through the land like blood through a body. The rivers are the arteries the streams are the veins. In summer it is a place best discovered by bicycle: step off a train in Wannsee or Potsdam, pedal west along bankside cycle lanes and pine-needle paths, find a quiet cove, then plunge into the water.Around and about, dragonflies mate in mid-flight, their wings knocking the rushes to make a sound like licking flames. Water spiders skate over the surface like minute balls of mercury. Birch tree branches are reflected in the water.On my wished-for journey, lunch will be an alfresco picnic or – if I’m feeling flush – trout and chanterelles at the Fährhaus Caputh, overlooking the water from a deckside table. Of course today the Fährhaus is closed, as are all other restaurants. The beaches are empty. On top of Germany’s stringent lockdown restrictions, foreign citizens on “non-essential travels” are refused entry to the country. But once the borders are open again, I’ll be on my bike, and in that water, and out in the open air.Rory MacLean is a travel writer and historian.

Even Ina Garten, the Barefoot Contessa food mogul and a portrait of homey wholesomeness, is quaffing cosmos out of a super-sized martini glass: “It’s always cocktail hour in a crisis!” she quipped on Instagram.“We know that drinking can increase under stressful conditions – that’s well-documented in the literature,” said Dr Rajita Sinha, director of Yale University’s Interdisciplinary Stress Center. “But the broader question you have is: Is that okay? And I would be wary. I would ask, are there alternative ways to cope with stress that are healthier?”For Richard McGilvray, a condo building concierge in Buffalo, NY, drinking has only latterly become a way to deal with stress. But the 26-year-old, who said he “almost never drank” before the quarantine, has taken to downing three or four Labatt beers while he plays Animal Crossing with his pregnant girlfriend. Neither one can work remotely, and their “essential” jobs feel newly risky and precarious.“I’m just kind of trying to relax,” McGilvray said. “This could all be swept away from us.”Across the country, in Sonoma county, California, 28-year-old programmer Mary-Katherine McKenzie is more secure – but equally buzzed. Siloed in her boyfriend’s weekend home with two friends, McKenzie’s lockdown has at times felt like an “extended vacation”. The hours melt together it “always feels like Thursday,” she said.And because the old schedules and norms are no longer as rigid, drinking earlier in the day, or on weekday nights, no longer feels inappropriate. One US university professor, who asked not to be named because of his work, said he has watched some of his colleagues start drinking as early as 11.He himself has contemplated the goldmine of data this period will give social science researchers. It’s a great natural experiment, he said, of the type academics always hope for. How did these weeks of isolation – and the wave of liberalized alcohol norms they prompted – impact cancer rates? Liver disease? Domestic violence?Recently, the professor drank half a bottle of bourbon during a Zoom happy hour with some colleagues and friends.“I don’t feel like I’m becoming an alcoholic – I don’t crave it,” he said. “But as a social scientist, I do wonder: what is driving that?”Those sorts of questions are critical now, said Dr Priscilla Martinez, a scientist studying the health effects of drinking at the Alcohol Research Group, a federally funded research center. Heavy drinking is not good for human health, under any circumstances – and recent research by Martinez, Sinha and others has shown that alcohol disrupts the immune system and compromises the brain’s stress-coping mechanisms.Among many other conditions, people with alcohol use disorders are more likely to develop respiratory diseases. They’re also more likely to struggle with issues like relapse and bingeing in quarantine. The World Health Organization recently published guidance encouraging people to “minimize their alcohol consumption at any time, and particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic.”But Martinez hesitates to mandate that drinkers go cold turkey. That’s not realistic, she said. And usually light or social drinkers are unlikely to develop habits that outlast the pandemic. Instead, it’s important that people track when, why and how much they’re drinking, and whether that changes.“I think it’s good to acknowledge the total bizarreness of the situation we’re in,” Martinez said. “It’s unlikely this will be the rest of our lives. What we’re doing now doesn’t have to be permanent.”That said, “awareness of your own drinking is important”, she added.Fortunately, some pandemic drinkers have reached that conclusion, themselves. One American teacher in Shanghai said he poured out every bottle of liquor in his house after realizing his drinking had become destructive.Even Quarantined Beer Chugs – that pinnacle of pandemic inebriation – has lately adopted a different tone. In the interest of “encouraging healthy habits,” said 31-year-old group founder Andrew Beile, QBC now hosts thrice-weekly “hydration days” and uses the slogan “all chugs welcome”. Posters will occasionally chug milk or water next to the usual beer, wine and vodka.“It’s erted from just chugging beers,” Beile said. “Because I realized this could become a long bender.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c893a4163c53847ad9362754d38133804fac7777/0_72_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93ff1392808cb71f7d26e4383ea75b89","title":"tell us what are your experiences of private covid 19 testing centres coronavirus","story":"If you’ve used a private coronavirus testing centre, we’d like to find out what the service was like.

But is evidence-based reality going to make a comeback?The most prominent American anti-vaxxer, Robert Kennedy Jr, meanwhile, amplified an unhinged conspiracy that believes Bill Gates is using the virus as part of a supposed plot to control the world’s population through immunisation.All pandemics trail a ready market in superstition, quackery and prejudice – a sense of powerlessness generates in some the need for catch-all theories, however deranged. At the time of the great plague in London, the spread of miracle cures and scapegoating prophecy was almost harder to contain than the infection itself. As part of its strategy the government was moved, Daniel Defoe reported in his A Journal of the Plague Year, to “suppress the printing of such Books and Pamphlets as terrify the People”. The efforts to prevent the spread of damaging conspiracies across our own media have shared a similar profile – and often a similar success rate – to the efforts to curb the disease.In this respect, the pandemic is something of a test case for the social media monopolies of Silicon Valley to deliver on their widely trumpeted commitment to slow the spread of dangerously false information. After being confronted with the evidence of manipulation in the elections of 2016, and the spread of such vile conspiracies as that which argued that the Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax, Facebook and Google and the rest have been forced to step up efforts to monitor and block extreme misinformation campaigns on their various platforms. Arguably, that effort is finally starting to show some effect.Counterintuitively, some evidence for that might be found in the response to the most pernicious of the current conspiracies which has, entirely without scientific foundation, sought to link the spread of coronavirus with the rollout of the 5G data network. The real-world effects have been the acts of vandalism and arson against mobile phone masts in the past weeks. Up to 50 such attacks have been reported, mostly on Merseyside and in the West Midlands, including the burning of the 5G mast adjacent to the new Nightingale hospital outside Birmingham. Thinking about contagious ideas now, I recall interviewing Daniel Dennett, the philosopher of evolution, back in 2006, just before the launch of Twitter. Dennett was talking excitedly of a word that he and Richard Dawkins had coined to describe how Darwinist idea-germs could be sent into battle against the politicised viruses of creationism. He called these idea-germs “memes”. Nah, I thought at the time it will never catch on.In the 14 years since, it has become second nature to trace the originators of particularly incendiary memes. A story in Wired magazine located the origin of the 5G conspiracy in an interview of 22 January in a Belgian newspaper with Kris Van Kerckhoven, a general practitioner from Putte, near Antwerp. He was quoted as saying that “5G is life-threatening”, but then added a speculative comment (“I have not done a fact-check”) that linked that falsehood to the virus then confined to China. The “link” became an ill-advised clickbait headline. (The piece, in Het Laatste Nieuws, was subsequently withdrawn.)If these words marked the moment when the 5G conspiracy established its RNA, however, the “wet market” for those ideas to jump species and spread human to human was a conference given on 11 March at the Health and Human Rights Summit, in Tucson, Arizona. The headline act was the original anti-vaxxer Andrew Wakefield, the discredited English doctor, who was struck off by the GMC after being shown to have deliberately falsified evidence to make bogus claims of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Wakefield was in this case upstaged by a Californian, Thomas Cowan, author of Cancer and the New Biology of Water, who is serving a five-year suspension from medical practice for prescribing unlicensed drugs to cancer patients. Cowan claimed, entirely falsely, that Covid-19 was caused by electromagnetic waves and, also incorrectly, that Wuhan, where it originated, had been the guinea-pig city for 5G.Videos of this talk were viewed 1.8 million times on YouTube and widely shared on Facebook before the sites moved to take the posts down.In their book A Lot of People Are Saying, their study of conspiracism in the Trump era, Russell Muirhead and Nancy Rosenblum classify people such as Cowan as “conspiracy entrepreneurs”. Once he had seeded his conspiracy virus, multiple other wilder mutations followed, some linking it to an Illuminati plot, others to the “blood sacrifice” of Kobe Bryant in a helicopter crash.In Britain, some of those contagious fantasies found a population in which they could move as easily as coronavirus among Cheltenham Festival racegoers. Their combination with media attention around the decision to allow Huawei to supply some of the UK’s 5G infrastructure, and the fact that telecoms engineers were designated key workers, appears to have ignited dangerous lockdown fears. Challenges were laid down in Facebook groups and Reddit threads for “firestarters” to “take the 5G out”.Social media platforms, fearing sanction, took long overdue action. Facebook has accepted a responsibility to remove false claims that 5G technology causes Covid-19, while promising a modification that will direct people who look for such content toward accurate information from the NHS and the WHO.Some of the belated efforts to police “alt-right” conspiracy content in the past couple of years are also helping to contain the spread of the madness. There has been no more virulent “conspiracy entrepreneur” than Alex Jones and his web channel, InfoWars. Jones has predictably loud-hailered the 5G and anti-vaxx lines: “This is the plan, folks,” he grunted at his viewers. “They plan – if they’ve fluoridated you and vaccinated you and stunned you and mesmerized you with the TV and put you in a trance – on killing you.” Meanwhile, “they” were determined “to make sure you don’t learn about the known antivirals”. Prominent among these, apparently, were Jones’s own “wellness” products: SuperSilver Whitening Toothpaste and ABL Nano Silver Gargle which, he claimed, “kills the sars-corona family at point-blank range”. (The only scientifically proven effect of the active ingredient in these products, colloidal silver, is that it turns your skin blue.)Up until last year Jones’s vicious untruths would have been spread by millions of followers on YouTube and Facebook and Twitter. However, with trials pending involving the bereaved Sandy Hook parents he repeatedly called “actors”, his platforms were finally shut down for “hate speech”.Having curtailed some of the spread of the most noxious threads, social media platforms apparently hope to rely, at least a little, on herd immunity to contain the conspiracy. When celebrity “super-spreaders” of the 5G claims have emerged in recent weeks – including the actor Woody Harrelson, the boxer Amir Khan and the breakfast show host Eamonn Holmes – they have the experienced the chill of immediate social media isolation and distancing.It is still early days in this ongoing battle between fact and fantasy, but perhaps the general global compliance with lockdown measures, and the increasing appetite for verifiable facts and figures, indicates that rational voices might yet be in the ascendancy.Even those on the frontline of protest against distancing measures in the southern American states have looked conspicuously conflicted. Several have marched under “coronahoax” banners while wearing face masks, hedging bets. Perhaps they have listened to the snake-oil “hunches” and tantrums of their president while the bodies pile up, and wondered. Perhaps they fear, privately, the tragic irony in the story of John McDaniel, 60, of Ohio, who spent March posting conspiracy – “Does Anybody Have The Guts to Say This Covid-19 is a Political Ploy? Asking For A Friend. Prove Me Wrong” – before, last week, becoming the first person in his county to die from the disease.History shows that pandemics change things in surprising ways. Much has been made of the superstition that has attended other epidemics, but they have also generated great advances in public health, including vaccination even the wildest conspiracy entrepreneur probably knows deep down that the only way out of the current tragedy is careful application of the scientific method.In the past few weeks we have been exposed to a reality that all human generations before ours – and many millions in our own times in less advantaged parts of the planet – have known as a fact of life: that we exist in a precarious world of rapidly transmitted infectious diseases without an obvious cure. Though the sight of mass graves being dug and economies floundering has caused some to double-down on their pet grievances, to set fire to phone masts and indulge their fantasies about the Illuminati, it may yet cause more to think about getting back in touch with reality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59af64897155bda0c0453fe83df3e7c8d97483ed/0_0_3415_2050/master/3415.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c207e31cdfbe7d6f28b0b1021d052112","title":"attendees of sage coronavirus meetings worried by presence of dominic cummings","story":"Scientists on UK government’s coronavirus advisory group say Dominic Cummings was an active participantThe involvement of the prime minister’s chief political adviser, Dominic Cummings, in meetings of the scientific group advising the UK government’s response to the coronavirus has left other attendees shocked, concerned and worried for the impartiality of advice, the  can reveal.One attendee of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said they felt Cummings’ interventions had sometimes inappropriately influenced what is supposed to be an impartial scientific process.A second Sage attendee said they were shocked when Cummings first began participating in Sage discussions, in February, because they believed the group should be providing “unadulterated scientific data” without any political input.’s revelation on Friday that Sage attendees have included Cummings and Ben Warner, who worked together on the Vote Leave campaign for Brexit, caused a storm of controversy over the weekend.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.Downing Street is insisting there is nothing untoward about the pair’s attendance at Sage meetings, saying they are largely taking part as silent observers.“I have been concerned sometimes that Sage has become too operational, so we’ve ended up looking as though we are making decisions,” one of them said, making clear that Cummings had been involved on those occasions. “It contravenes previous guidelines about how you make sure you get impartial scientific advice going through to politicians, who make the decisions.”Referring to both Cummings and Warner, the Sage attendee added: “When a very senior civil servant or a very well-connected person interrupts, then I don’t think anyone in the room feels the power to stop it. When you get to discussing where advice might be going, there have been occasions where they have been involved, and a couple of times I’ve thought: that’s not what we are supposed to be doing.”A second Sage attendee said Cummings had played an active role meetings from February onwards. They said they were initially shocked to discover Cummings was taking part in a meeting of supposedly independent scientific experts.“He was not just an observer, he’s listed as an active participant,” the source said. “He was engaging in conversation and not sitting silently.” The second attendee said Cumming’s involvement was worrying because of his reputation in Whitehall and the questions his participation raises about Sage’s role as a neutral body of expert advisers.The reaction from the two Sage attendees contrasts with that of Prof Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College epidemiologist whose models have played a guiding role in the government’s response to Covid-19. He appeared unconcerned when asked, in a video interview, about Cummings attending Sage meetings. “There have been a number of observers at those meetings, who have not interfered with business at all,” he replied.Sage membership is not fixed, but changes according to the nature of the crisis being faced. Independent scientific experts on the group are supposed to assess evidence impartially and pass their advice to Cobra, the civil contingencies committee convened in the Cabinet Office.The advisory group is chaired by the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, who also decides which experts take part. Asked whether Vallance had also given his approval to Cummings and Warner coming to his meetings, a government spokesperson said Vallance “would not have to sign off” observers or representatives from government departments.The chief medical officers and chief scientific advisers from the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are classified as observers on Sage. However, unlike Cummings and Warner, they are unable to ask questions unless they are submitted in writing in advance.George Eustice, the environment secretary, was asked about the makeup of Sage during Sunday’s Downing Street press conference.He said it was “convened in response to specific emergencies, and the scientists that go on to that group will change, depending on the type of emergency.” He said minutes of its deliberations would eventually be published.Stephen Powis, the national medical director for England, appearing alongside Eustice, said he would have “no problem” with the names of those who attend being made public, provided their personal permission had been sought. Chief medical officer Chris Whitty has previously said the same thing.On Saturday, Labour urged the government to ban political advisers from attending Sage. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said there were significant questions for the government to answer over the credibility of its decision-making and how non-scientists have influenced policy.He said Cummings was “a political adviser, not a medical or scientific expert. If the public are to have confidence in Sage, the government must make clear Dominic Cummings can no longer participate or attend.”The Conservative former Brexit secretary, David Davis, also criticised the attendance of Cummings and Warner at the Sage meetings. “The whole point of having Sage is you’re getting scientific advice based on the data, based on the best theories, and the best models we have at the time,” he told Sky News. “You don’t want any outside influences, either direct or indirect, either deliberate or accidental.”However the former Conservative chancellor, Sajid Javid, argued it would be “worrying” if Cummings was not present at the Sage’s Covid-19 meetings, and criticised the ’s reporting. “Media have a hugely important role in holding government to account, but some are courting public mistrust with non-stories,” Javid tweeted. “Time to act more responsibly.”The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said the government does not release the membership of the Sage committee because of the risk of pressure on members: “Sage do release their advice subsequently, normally a couple of weeks down the track, so it is properly tested carefully before being put out. We don’t release, as a matter of practice, the names of all the members of Sage because the risk of them being subject to pressure, undue influence.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/256f1405fc26ff0c2cd90ca9a80e8a14726705aa/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=410e48da0bbea0ad1f49d840c89e746b","title":"hungary prepares to end legal recognition of trans people","story":"Trans people fear more discrimination as Orbán pushes through law defining gender based on ‘sex at birth’Hungary’s rightwing government looks likely to push through legislation that will end the legal recognition of trans people by defining gender as “biological sex based on primary sex characteristics and chromosomes” and thus making it impossible for people to legally change their gender.Trans people and rights activists say the law, which has been introduced into parliament as attention is focused on the coronavirus pandemic, will increase discrimination and intolerance towards trans people. Many will try to leave the country, while those who do not have that chance will face daily humiliations.“In Hungary, you need to show your ID to rent a bike, buy a bus pass or to pick up a package at the post office. It basically means coming out as trans to complete strangers, all the time. The good version is they are nice about it, but there are situations where people turn quite hostile,” said Ivett Ördög, a 39-year-old trans woman living in Budapest.Hungary’s anti-immigration prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has prompted a wave of international criticism during the coronavirus pandemic by adopting legislation that allows him to rule by decree indefinitely. Parliament is still sitting, but instead of focusing on fighting coronavirus, it is dealing with issues such as the new trans legislation.Bernadett Szél, an independent MP who has opposed the law in parliament’s judicial committee, described it as “evil” and “a step back in time”. During a hearing in the committee, she tried to read out a letter from trans people explaining how harmful the law would be for them, but was shut down by the committee’s chair, who described the letter as “not relevant”.Szél also criticised the timing of the bill. “We have a pandemic going on and all of us should be focusing on two things: healthcare issues and helping people financially to secure their wellbeing. What is happening in Hungary is a scandal,” she said. It is not clear when the bill will be put to a vote, but observers say its passage through committees suggests the government is pushing ahead with it.The law also opens up the possibility that it could target people who have already made a legal change and now live with a gender that does not match their “sex at birth”, the planned new gender category on official documents.“We think it’s likely that they don’t plan to go after people who already changed, but we just don’t know,” said Tamás Dombos, a board member of the Háttér Society, a Hungarian organisation focused on LGBTQI rights.Legal experts say the new law will be in violation of European human rights case law, leaving it open to challenge in both the Hungarian supreme court and the European court of human rights (ECHR).“There’s very clear case law on this in the ECHR, so it’s very likely it will be challenged soon after it’s implemented. But the court takes years, and the decisions are always inidual. People will probably get compensation but it won’t mean they get new documents,” said Dombos.Until 2016, the procedure for legally changing gender in Hungary was fairly straightforward, said Dombos, but for the past three years, authorities have been reluctant to implement the law, meaning there is a backlog of people waiting for decisions on their applications for gender changes. “My request has been sitting there for a year, and this new law will mean it will be fully rejected,” said Ördög.Orbán’s government has become more hostile towards the LGBTQ+ community in the past two years, moving from generic language about traditional values and the benefits of heterosexual marriage to openly discriminatory language, such as comparing homosexuality to paedophilia.“This kind of language was not present before, and now it is no longer just discourse, it’s going to become policy,” said Dombos.Although it will still be possible for people to change their names, in Hungary there is an official register of allowed names compiled by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and this list is gendered. There are no names approved for both genders. “I cannot change my legal name to anything that doesn’t give me away as a trans person,” said Ördög.Even without the new law, life for trans people in Hungary is filled with obstacles. Amanda Malovics, a 30-year-old trans woman, left Hungary in 2015 for London, with one suitcase and enough money to last a month, she said, as she felt uncomfortable starting her transition in Hungary.In Britain she has changed her name by deed poll, which means that bank accounts, bills and the rest of her life in London can be conducted under her new name. As soon as she needs to travel, however, she is faced with using her Hungarian passport with her old name and gender. She applied to change her gender in Hungary last year but, like others, has had the application stalled.“I live and breathe as a woman, I look like a woman, I am present in myself as a woman and I identify as a woman, but my ID says otherwise. I absolutely hate travelling, because of this. There’s massive fear and anxiety every time,” she said.Now, she says, she is waiting until she qualifies for UK citizenship to receive a passport in her new name, and at that point will consider making the difficult decision to revoke her Hungarian citizenship. She believes many other Hungarian trans people will also leave.“It’s pointless for me to belong somewhere where I’m not wanted or welcome,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e05e7bb4f68158199f30d7aae103d22143ff040/0_308_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1bdab298e5f0a9bf1b98212cb48678c","title":"its blissful people living under uk flight paths savour plane free skies coronavirus","story":"A week or so ago, Iain Chirnside was lying on a trampoline in his back garden with his 12-year-old son, Oscar, when they heard a noise. “We both looked at each other and said, ‘What the heck is that?’ And we looked up and saw that it was an easyJet plane.” It caused a momentary jolt: “Flip! I had almost forgotten about that!”The family live in the flight path of Aberdeen airport and in more normal times, as well as frequent planes, they also endure regular helicopter flights to the region’s oil rigs – which have also dramatically reduced since the twin crises of coronavirus and oil prices struck. Shortly before spotting the plane, Chirnside says, he had been delighted to hear the call of a buzzard high above his garden for the first time.It is a sentiment that has been felt keenly across the country by those who live under flight paths, who find themselves unexpectedly able to breathe clean air, hear birdsong and – for many of the worst affected – sit in their own gardens. In the week before Britain went into lockdown, 7,865 flights departed the UK’s 10 biggest airports, according to a BBC analysis of flight data. During the week to 21 April, the number recorded by Flightradar24 was 711.For some, the change in their quality of life has been dramatic. “It’s blissful at the moment,” says Maggie Thorburn, who lives in Isleworth, west London, so close to Heathrow that at the worst times of the day planes usually scream over her home every 90 seconds, with constant air traffic from 4.30am until 11pm.So dominant is the noise from the airport, says Thorburn, that in normal times her decisions when to open her windows or sit in her garden are driven entirely by Heathrow’s flight schedule.With flight numbers down by two thirds, however, she is certainly sleeping better, “and I can hear things from further away – the church clock striking, and of course the birds. It’s not the same as being in the countryside, but it’s the next best thing. It really is a huge relief to be able to be home and have some peacefulness.”Of course, no one is pretending the clean air and relative quiet comes without a cost. While the national economy has been clobbered by the lockdown, the collapse in air travel means towns near airports are among the worst affected. Research by the Centre for Cities suggests that in Crawley, close to Gatwick, more than half of all jobs are vulnerable either to being furloughed or lost altogether – a dizzying speed of collapse that is entirely without precedent, according to Paul Swinney, the thinktank’s director of policy and research.“Of course, the hope would be that while the downturn is unprecedented the bounce back in theory will be very quick as well,” he says.However, for Thorburn, who is vice-chair of the group Hacan which campaigns against Heathrow expansion, a return to what once was considered normal is a prospect that provokes dread. “I have got used to not hearing the planes all the time. And when they come back – if they come back – I am not looking forward to business as usual.”With many airlines struggling even to survive, it is not clear when, if at all, air travel will return to its pre-coronavirus levels – though Swinney says he thinks flying is likely eventually to recover, because “there aren’t enough viable alternatives to flying to different places”.For Shaun Davidson, however, whose east London home lies in the flightpath of the closed London City airport, his newly quiet back garden has made him wonder whether it’s time to reexamine the compromises city dwellers make with aircraft noise.“It’s made me think more about how many flights people take and how many are necessary. We probably do travel more than we need to.” Is it really worth it, he says, when the alternative might be “to have clearer skies, a nicer environment around. Yes I guess I have started questioning that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d345022ca803439712ae318d5e0271bfaa8677e5/138_0_3292_1977/master/3292.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2782c81f7075e38c9830d3852ae92af","title":"the key areas to look at in easing the uk coronavirus lockdown","story":"From schools to shops, with jobs at risk, the government must balance the interests of economy and public safetyAs the prime minister, Boris Johnson, heads back to Downing Street, he faces calls from Labour to be clearer about how Britain might start lifting the coronavirus lockdown, now entering its fifth week. On Sunday, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, warned the outbreak remained at a “delicate and dangerous” stage and said it was irresponsible to speculate about steps to modify the rules underpinning government’s “stay home, protect the NHS, save lives” strategy.More than 20,000 people have died from Covid-19 in NHS hospitals and thousands more in care homes. But there are growing concerns about the economic impact of lockdown. Gerard Lyons, Johnson’s economics adviser when he was London mayor, warned on Sunday the UK could be the hardest-hit western economy if it does not unlock soon. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, also called on ministers to start talking to teachers, businesses, trade unions and town hall leaders and open “honest conversations with the public about what new arrangements might look like”. Unions insist worker safety must not be compromised by any changes and questions remain about public appetite for risking a new peak of contagion, but plans to modify restrictions are starting to emerge.One-way systems and plastic till barriers are among strategies to be used by retailers to reopen non-food stores. The DIY retailer Homebase tested the waters by reopening 20 of its stores on Saturday while the electronics retailer Dixons Carphone said it will launch “zero-contact” stores. Its Norwegian shops have remained open using contactless ordering and payment, prepaid pickups and increased cleaning and hygiene. This could be replicated in the UK, the firm said.Clothes shops could reopen, but with changing rooms off limits, according to guidelines published on Sunday by the British Retail Consortium. It has recommended store managers designate different entrances and exits and send shoppers through aisles in a one-way system to limit contact. Shopper numbers should also be restricted, promotional displays pared back to give customers more space and product demonstrations avoided to deter clustering. Tills will be shielded with plastic screens, as seen in some supermarkets, and floor markings in payment queues will keep customers two metres apart.Raab confirmed on Sunday that people arriving at ports and airports could be quarantined for 14 days as part of emerging plans to lift Britain out of its lockdown. Officials at the Home Office, which is responsible for border security, and the Department for Transport are reported to have drafted plans for 14-day “stay at home” notices, similar to those currently issued to Singaporean citizens returning from abroad. Such a rule would apply to foreign arrivals as well as UK citizens, with fines for failure to remain at the address given for isolation. Raab told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show: “Whether it is a quarantine period, or testing or other measures that might be taken, it is possible.”Ibstock, one of Britain’s biggest brick-makers, will restart production on Monday, and ministers appear keen for builders to catch up on time lost during the lockdown. Construction sites have been kept open since the 23 March lockdown, with physical distancing rules in place. Due to sickness and self-isolation, however, many contracts are well behind. Two of the UK’s biggest housebuilders, Persimmon and Vistry (formerly Bovid) are due to reopen sites on Monday, with Persimmon’s chief executive, David Jenkinson, saying the firm has “new site protocols that incorporate the necessary social distancing and protective measures”.Builders could be allowed to work through evenings and weekends, in temporary lifting of noise abatement rules, it was reported at the weekend. Planning conditions currently limit how late builders can work and tend to prohibit Sunday working.After the deaths of taxi drivers, care workers, nurses and doctors from Covid-19 picked up at work, trade unions are demanding that all employers produce risk assessments before lockdown is eased. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) said that two in five workers are concerned about not being able to phyiscally distance from colleagues, and more than a quarter are concerned about not being able to physically distance from customers or clients. Building workers organised by Unite said that because workers on housebuilding sites are mostly self-employed, enforcing health and safety guidelines will be difficult.“We need tough new measures from government to reassure working people that their health and safety is a priority,” said Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC. “Too many workers have already been forced to put their health on the line during this pandemic. We all want everyone to get back to work and start rebuilding Britain. But workers need confidence that they won’t have to put themselves or their families at unnecessary risk.”The headteachers union ASCL has said it does not think schools could reopen until 1 June at the earliest. The home secretary, Priti Patel, said at the weekend the government would not put a date on it because it would be “irresponsible and get hopes up”. Raab, said it would be “inconceivable” to send children back to school without physical distancing. This all points to schools being one of the later steps in any lockdown lifting.Labour is applying pressure though, with shadow cabinet member Rachel Reeves warning “young people are missing out on vital days and weeks and months of their education”. The Sutton Trust has found that two-thirds of pupils have not taken part in any online learning while at home, with independent school pupils more likely to be keeping up remotely. Social workers are concerned that the most vulnerable children will suffer most as the schools remain closed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb05e8efbab9daf99563fb4054ef86b80c7ccdc6/0_143_4676_2806/master/4676.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd8f67bded61000b8c710c56a60e2161","title":"24 hrs madrid emergency ambulance coronavirus photo essay","story":"Photojournalist Pablo García Sacristán spent a day and night with Madrid’s Summa crews, offering medical - and psychological – support to coronavirus patientsby Pablo García Sacristán in MadridAt 8am on a normal weekday, the streets of Madrid would be choked with traffic.But there’s been no such thing as a normal day n the capital for well over a month. Normality has long since disappeared in the fight against Covid-19, and the city’s main arteries are unclogged by cars.This makes life easier for the 29 specialised ambulances of the regional medical emergency service (Summa), which have traversed in and around the capital since mid-March, responding to a seemingly endless series of calls.Onboard one of the ambulances – callsign UV16 – is Dr Alonso Mateo, the assistant head of Madrid’s regional transplant coordination service. After setting up a makeshift hospital in a hotel and doing shifts at the huge field hospital at Madrid’s main convention centre, Mateo now forms part of a mobile crew. Alongside him are Marta Vivas, a nurse, and two technicians, Daniel Martínez and Miguel Collado, the latter of whom hs recently returned to work after being off for 20 days with coronavirus.“I’m not scared of it at all but I’ve got a healthy respect for it, and I want to do my bit when it comes to putting an end to this nightmare,” says Miguel.After coffee and a careful revision of their kit, the first call of the day comes in and they set off at full speed from their base in the working-class neighbourhood of Vallecas.On arrival, they suit up in their personal protective equipment. All cases must be treated as potential Covid-19, so overalls go on, along with gloves and masks. They dress with practised speed and efficiency.Inside, one of the technicians remains at the door as the designated “clean man”. It is his job to help his colleagues out of their gear when they emerge and disinfect their outfitsMateo has been an intensive care unit doctor for 15 years, “but it was only during the time of Ebola that we learned to put on isolation suits – even though we always carried them in the ambulances”.Things are different now, he adds: “For any kind of urgent job we use total isolation measures – and hardcore suits – for the patient’s protection, and for our own. A very high proportion of people who have caught the disease are health workers, and we just can’t do what we’re called on to do if those numbers stay as they are.”“Getting to someone’s house and being able to help them when they’re hanging between life and death is something money just can’t buy,” says Marta.But sadly – and as Dani points out – that’s not always the case.“Sometimes we have to watch as people die and there’s nothing we can do about it,” he says. “That’s really tough and something you just have to try to learn to live with. You just have to keep it together because there’s always someone who needs your help and you need to fight to save their lives.”Mónica Coll, the doctor on ambulance UV15 gets one such call mid-afternoon. She and the nurse, Guillermo Lago, arrive to find an elderly woman with breathing problems and a fever. Everything points to Covid-19 and there’s nothing that can be done.The pair treat the woman’s sister with enormous care and kindness, and, thanks to them, she watches her sister die with an uncommon serenity. They tell her that she died without any pain or suffering, and that that is the most important thing in the circumstances.On the other side of the door, UV15’s technician, Roberto Gonzalez and Javier García, are waiting. The report needs to be filled out before their colleagues can be disinfected.Even in times such as these, older people are scared of going to hospital because it means they will be on their own. They tend to leave it to the last minute, by which time it’s often too late.They fear the loneliness and the idea of being left to face their final moments alone. They also know that most of their relatives will not be able to come to their funerals either, because coronavirus has done away with the familiar norms – like going to hospital when you feel ill like knowing someone will be beside you when you die.And that is where the ambulance crews that tear across Madrid come in: it’s not just physical help they bring – it’s psychological support, too.Although the pace of the day is relentless things calm briefly when the team stops for dinner. They have 15 minutes for a salad and coffee before work resumes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72cfb66345fad17c9d44426890ba995a98138fb1/0_154_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c889fe3808a473cf76c5e6ac573d45bb","title":"bangladesh urged to open ports to allow in rohingya refugee boats","story":"More than 500 stranded on trawlers in what UN calls ‘human tragedy of terrible proportions’The Bangladeshi government has been urged to open its ports and allow two boats carrying hundreds of Rohingya refugees to come ashore so they can be given urgent medical care, food and water.It is believed more than 500 people, including children, are onboard the stranded trawlers, which were recently seen in the Bay of Bengal but have reportedly returned to the high seas. Last week, Bangladesh’s foreign minister, Abdul Momen, said the boats would not be allowed entry, adding: “Bangladesh is always asked to take care of the responsibility of other countries.”Earlier this month, Bangladesh rescued a separate boat that had been left adrift for two months after attempting to reach Malaysia. The charity Médecins Sans Frontières, which treated about 400 survivors, said the passengers were mostly aged between 12 and 20, and some younger children were also onboard. More than 70 people are reported to have died on the boat.“Many of them couldn’t stand or walk on their own,” said Hanadi Katerji, MSF nurse and medical team leader. “They were just skin and bone – a lot of them were barely alive.”The boat had carried hundreds of Rohingya refugees fleeing desperate conditions in Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh, where more than 1 million refugees live in overcrowded camps.

They live predominately in Rakhine state, where they have co-existed uneasily alongside Buddhists for decades.Rohingya people say they are descendants of Muslims, perhaps Persian and Arab traders, who came to\u0026nbspMyanmar\u0026nbspgenerations ago. Unlike the Buddhist community, they speak a language similar to the Bengali dialect of Chittagong in Bangladesh.The Rohingya are reviled by many in Myanmar as illegal immigrants and suffer from systematic discrimination. The Myanmar government treats them as stateless people, denying them citizenship. Stringent restrictions have been placed on Rohingya people’s freedom of movement, access to medical assistance, education and other basic services.Violence broke out in northern Rakhine state in August 2017, when\u0026nbspmilitants attacked government forces. In response, security forces supported by Buddhist militia launched a “clearance operation”\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbsp ultimately killed at least 1,000 people and forced more than 600,000 to flee their homes. The UN’s\u0026nbsptop human rights official\u0026nbspsaid the military’s response was clearly disproportionate” to insurgent attacks and warned that Myanmar’s treatment of its Rohingya minority appears to be a textbook example” of ethnic cleansing.When Aung San Suu Kyi rose to power there were\u0026nbsphigh hopes\u0026nbspthat the Nobel peace prize winner would help heal Myanmar\u0027s entrenched ethnic ides. But she has been accused of standing by while violence is committed against the Rohingya.In 2019, judges at the international criminal court authorised a full-scale investigation into the allegations of mass persecution and crimes against humanity. On 10 December 2019, the international court of justice in The Hague opened a case alleging genocide brought by the Gambia.It is not clear how long the two boats stranded off Bangladesh have been stuck at sea, or how many additional ships may be adrift elsewhere.“They will be at high risk of death because that’s what we’ve heard in testimonies of survivors that were rescued previously by the Bangladesh government,” said Saad Hammadi, south Asia campaigner at Amnesty International. “It’s a responsibility of all governments in the region to ensure that their seas do not turn into invisible graveyards.”On Friday, the UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, wrote to Momen describing the situation as “a human tragedy of terrible proportions”.“I appeal to you in the strongest terms to open your ports and allow the boats to land,” she wrote. “The reportedly more than 500 men, women and children aboard these boats have been at sea for an extended period of time, and we understand that they require urgent rescue, food, medical care and other necessary humanitarian assistance.”Bachelet added that she was also encouraging other governments in the region to take similar action.Malaysia has turned away at least two boats, with the country’s air force stating that it recently refused entry to about 200 refugees in order to prevent further spread of the coronavirus within the country, which remains under lockdown.Rights groups fear that governments are using the global health crisis as a pretext to push boats back, and say it is an alarming reminder of a 2015 Andaman sea crisis, when many Rohingya died at sea after south-east Asian nations refused them entry.Momen said Bangladesh could not rescue any more people, adding that the country had “no room to shelter any foreign people or refugees”.More than 700,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar following a brutal army crackdown that began in August 2017. The UN has since described the military’s actions as ethnic cleaning and akin to genocide.Brad Adams, the Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said Bangladesh had “shouldered a heavy burden as the result of the Myanmar military’s atrocity crimes, but this is no excuse to push boatloads of refugees out to sea to die”.He added: “Bangladesh should continue to help those at grave risk and preserve the international goodwill it has gained in recent years for helping the Rohingya.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e2c41fb8b2931da1a4d07f9becdbfa832a498ee/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=80a6e9f9b53edb460899b317dcb53716","title":"covid 19 vaccines pressure is on to ensure they go to the most needy not the highest bidder","story":"Australian chair of global coalition which aims to ensure vaccines are distributed fairly says there will be an ‘astronomical’ push to get access to successful onesAs the global race for a Covid-19 vaccine intensifies, there’s a question Jane Halton and her team come back to time and again: if and when successful vaccines emerge, what can be done to ensure they don’t simply go to those with the deepest pockets?If market power is allowed to dictate access, how can those most vulnerable to Covid-19 be assured of protection?“We are acutely aware of this and it is literally a topic that is being discussed on a daily basis,” she tells the . “Because to us it is just unacceptable that there is not fair access to a successful vaccine across the world’s population.“The notion that this would be a question of going to the highest bidder, to us is just totally unacceptable.”Halton, a former secretary of Australia’s health and finance departments, is chair of the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations, a global body playing a critical role in financing and coordinating Covid-19 vaccine development.One of its founding aims is to ensure that vaccines, once developed, are distributed fairly.The world has witnessed what happens when the market is left to dictate vaccine distribution. During the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, wealthy nations negotiated large advance orders of the vaccine, effectively crowding out poorer countries.The West African ebola crisis – an outbreak that killed 11,325 people – exposed its own galling market failure.Even as the death toll in West Africa grew and grew, big pharmaceuticals could not see a way to recoup the considerable losses they would face attempting to find a vaccine.The leader of Britain’s ebola response, Adrian Hill, said there was simply no “big market” to make it worthwhile for massive corporations.“There was no business case to make an ebola vaccine for the people who needed it most,” he said.It was out of that failure that the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations emerged.“The world’s response to this crisis fell tragically short,” it says in explaining its background. “A vaccine that had been under development for more than a decade was not deployed until over a year into the epidemic.“This risk is real,” the paper warned. “Such an outcome would result in a suboptimal allocation of an initially scarce resource.”Halton predicts the pressure to secure access to successful vaccines will be “astronomical”.“One of the things I’m worried about is vaccine nationalism and I’ve started to use that terminology when I talk to people,” she says.“We’ve been worrying about this issue now for months and months ... What is a mechanism to ensure equitable access?”An estimated minimum of 1 billion people across the globe are vulnerable to Covid-19. They fall into a number of categories: the immunocompromised, those with co-morbidities, the ageing, and frontline medical staff.“So that says to you you need a lot of vaccine to protect even the most vulnerable in our society,” Halton says.It’s a problem the World Health Organisation is also working urgently to solve. This week it announced it planned to design mechanisms to ensure equitable distribution.“While we’re looking for vaccines, unless we break the barriers to equitable distribution of the products, whether it’s vaccines or therapeutics, we will have a problem, so we need to address the problem ahead of time,” WHO’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said.“There should not be a ide between the haves and the have-nots.”For private companies, vaccine development is considered risky, protracted and hugely expensive.Companies are faced with the prospect of spending extraordinary amounts to develop vaccines, with a low likelihood of success.It believes it needs $US2bn to develop three vaccine candidates in the next 12 to 18 months. It has raised almost half of that.The $2bn does not include the costs of manufacture or delivery.The coalition’s work emphasises speed. Each stage of the vaccine development process is compressed. Halton says the speed at which Covid-19 vaccines are being developed is “unprecedented”.One of the projects the coalition is funding is at the University of Queensland, where researchers are testing a molecular clamp technology they hope can help neutralise the virus.The coalition asked UQ researchers to begin working on a Covid-19 vaccine in January. Within three weeks it had produced the candidate now being tested.“Like every researcher who’s looking at their baby, they are optimistic,” she says. “All I can say is I hope they’re right. I genuinely hope they’re right. It’s very hard for me to form a judgment about the likelihood of success.”More broadly, she remains optimistic.“I think when we look across all the work that’s going on globally on vaccines, I do have some hope that we will end up with not just one successful candidate – ideally we would have three,” she says.“I’ve said this now publicly several times: hope for the best but prepare for the worst. And if you hope for the best what you would do is hope to get three successful candidates.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f5ea27fe3e9f7b80a4e35b39da080bb8086bff6/0_212_5209_3126/master/5209.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df8b15f12988a8031088b57862da9aca","title":"czech republic shops reopen as part of gradual coronavirus lockdown exit","story":"Country eases coronavirus measures after quick response helped it limit cases to 7,400Many shops outside shopping malls are reopening in the Czech Republic after the government brought forward its five-stage lockdown exit plan, amid reports that the British government is closely watching the country’s back-to-business strategy.Under increasing pressure to lift parts of the UK’s lockdown and limit the damage to the economy, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is understood to be studying the Czech Republic’s approach to lifting the tight restrictions it imposed earlier than most countries further west, which have helped it limit cases to 7,400, with just 221 deaths.Prague was one of the few governments to declare a state of emergency before the country had recorded its first coronavirus death. By 11 March it had closed all schools, limited public gatherings, banned all public events, sealed its borders and shuttered all non-essential stores. It also made face masks obligatory in public.Early this month it became the first European country to relax its restrictions, initially by allowing citizens to cycle, jog and walk in the countryside without wearing their masks, as long as they stayed 2 metres apart.Some sports facilities, such as tennis courts and golf courses, were allowed to reopen as long as no more than two people played together, and selected non-essential shops – including cycle stores, repair shops and hardware and DIY stores – also returned to business on 9 April.On 15 April the government unveiled a detailed five-step plan to reopen the broader economy, with the deputy prime minister, Karel Havlíček, iding businesses and activities into five main groups which would reopen their doors in stages over the following eight weeks.Craft shops, car dealerships and farmers’ markets were the first to reopen from 20 April, with smaller shops outside shopping malls scheduled to follow on 27 April, then larger shops outside malls, driving schools and fitness centres.The final stages will happen in late May and early June, with restaurants allowed to serve customers outside, and hairdressers and beauty salons permitted to reopen, followed by shopping malls. Bars and restaurants were to be allowed to resume indoor service by 9 June, with hotels also allowed to reopen.Public amenities and meeting places, such as museums and galleries, as well as cultural venues including theatres, would be among the last facilities to reopen, while schools were to start returning from 11 May. Havlíček stressed that the government reserved the right to adjust its dates.As its infection curve continued to fall, however, the government last Thursday brought forward its exit plan, speeding up the process. Most venues are now to reopen two weeks earlier than initially planned, with gyms and all stores smaller than 2,500sq m outside shopping malls allowed to reopen on Monday.The five-stage plan is now a four-stage plan: outdoor restaurant and bar areas reopen from 11 May, along with hairdressers and beauty salons, with restaurants expected to resume indoor service and hotels allowed to reopen from 25 May, two weeks earlier than the previous 8 June date.The government also unexpectedly announced it would open its borders for outbound foreign travel after recording a decline in the number of infections. The health minister, Adam Vojtěch, said returning travellers would have to prove they were uninfected or spend 14 days in quarantine.Face masks will remain mandatory until the end of June, but restrictions are being eased on movement within the country, with groups of up to 10 now permitted to gather, compared with a previous limit of two.The full breakdown of the country’s lockdown exit plan is as follows:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc56e80bbf86f992928b9bb6df7aaa5311e7ea84/0_0_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6886f26cb86f9ec85930751300b9516b","title":"halt destruction nature worse pandemics top scientists","story":"Exclusive: only one species is responsible for coronavirus – humans – say world’s leading wildlife expertsThe coronavirus pandemic is likely to be followed by even more deadly and destructive disease outbreaks unless their root cause – the rampant destruction of the natural world – is rapidly halted, the world’s leading bioersity experts have warned.“There is a single species responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic – us,” they said. “Recent pandemics are a direct consequence of human activity, particularly our global financial and economic systems that prize economic growth at any cost. We have a small window of opportunity, in overcoming the challenges of the current crisis, to avoid sowing the seeds of future ones.”Professors Josef Settele, Sandra Díaz and Eduardo Brondizio led the most comprehensive planetary health check ever undertaken, which was published in 2019 by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). It concluded that human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating decline of the Earth’s natural life-support systems.In an article published on Monday, with Dr Peter Daszak, who is preparing the next IPBES assessment, they write: “Rampant deforestation, uncontrolled expansion of agriculture, intensive farming, mining and infrastructure development, as well as the exploitation of wild species have created a ‘perfect storm’ for the spillover of diseases.”“Future pandemics are likely to happen more frequently, spread more rapidly, have greater economic impact and kill more people if we are not extremely careful about the possible impacts of the choices we make today,” they said.The scientists said the multitrillion-dollar economic recovery packages being rolled out by governments must be used to strengthen and enforce environmental protection: “It may be politically expedient to relax environmental standards and to prop up industries such as intensive agriculture, airlines, and fossil-fuel-dependent energy sectors, but doing so without requiring urgent and fundamental change essentially subsidises the emergence of future pandemics.”A global “One Health” approach must also be expanded, they said. “The health of people is intimately connected to the health of wildlife, the health of livestock and the health of the environment. It’s actually one health,” said Daszak.Furthermore, surveillance programmes and health services need to be properly funded in nations on the frontlines of pandemic risk, they said: “This is not simple altruism – it is vital investment in the interests of all to prevent future global outbreaks.”Daszak said: “The programmes we’re talking about will cost tens of billions of dollars a year. But if you get one pandemic, even just one a century, that costs trillions, so you still come out with an incredibly good return on investment.“Business as usual will not work. Business as usual right now for pandemics is waiting for them to emerge and hoping for a vaccine. That’s not a good strategy. We need to deal with the underlying drivers.”In March, the UN’s environment chief, Inger Andersen, told the  “nature is sending us a message” with the coronavirus pandemic and the ongoing climate crisis. She said failing to take care of the planet meant not taking care of ourselves.“It is the consequence of our persistent and excessive intrusion in nature and the vast illegal wildlife trade, and in particular the wildlife markets, the wet markets, of south Asia and bush meat markets of Africa,” he said. Earlier in April, a major study found that the human impact on wildlife was to blame for the spread of viruses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5385692c9f44b579dc4234b8cde3cd16df990c37/0_120_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81fedf544d8e5a9f92fe5bae2f700850","title":"italy unveils plans for easing of coronavirus lockdown restrictions conte","story":"Factories to resume as country records lowest daily rise in death toll since mid-MarchItaly’s prime minister has outlined plans to slowly ease the country’s seven-week lockdown, as he warned about the risk of the coronavirus infection curve rising again.“If you love Italy, keep your distance,” Giuseppe Conte told Italians on Sunday night, as Covid-19 fatalities rose by 260 – the country’s lowest day-to-day increase since 14 March.People’s movements will still very much be restricted under the plan, which envisages schools remaining closed until September.Factories geared towards exports and public construction projects can resume activity from Monday, while the majority of Italy’s industry will restart from 4 May – a day after the lockdown expires.Although he thanked citizens for the sacrifices they had already made after almost seven weeks in quarantine, Conte said “phase two” would be about “co-existing with the virus”.“You must always respect the safe distance of at least one metre,” he added. “Even within the family setting. Experts tell us that one out of four cases of infection occur in the family context.”Italians will be able to travel within their regions to visit relatives, so long as face masks are worn, but movement between regions will still be banned unless for work, health or other emergency purposes.Parks and public gardens will reopen from 4 May and people can go for a walk or exercise outside so long as they maintain physical distancing. However, citizens will still need to carry a document citing the reason for venturing away from their home. On public transport, which will continue to run on limited services, face masks will be mandatory.Museums, galleries, libraries and retailers will reopen on 18 May and bars, restaurants and hairdressers from 1 June.“We all want the country to restart,” Conte said. “However, the only way to live with the virus in this phase is to not fall ill – and social distancing.”Restrictions on funerals have been relaxed, with a maximum of 15 mourners allowed to attend, but Conte was criticised for keeping churches and other religious sites closed.“You can go to a museum but not celebrate a religious rite?” Elena Bonetti, the equal opportunity and family minister, said on Twitter. Teresa Bellanova, the agriculture minister, told La Repubblica the continued ban on masses was “absurd”.Italy’s economy, which was already on the brink of recession before the outbreak, is suffering tremendously from the lockdown. Small businesses are entitled to apply for subsidised bank loans, repayable after two years, and along with freelance workers they can receive €600 a month for each month in lockdown. However, many have not yet received the compensation due to Italy’s stifling bureaucracy.Many business owners are still paying rent and bills on their premises, despite not generating an income during the lockdown period, while tax payments have merely been postponed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0713e6057fc514330c62b49c24393210dd4707c/0_171_5076_3047/master/5076.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=53f800820ab7884f538d12faab4f521c","title":"over 70s have you been shielding yourselves from coronavirus at home","story":"If you are over 70-years-old and living in the UK, we’d like to know how you feel about the current situation – and the futureWe would like to hear from over-70s who have been staying at home to shield themselves from coronavirus.More than five weeks ago, the government told over-70s to be particularly stringent in following physical distancing measures – especially for those with underlying health conditions – and to limit face-to-face interactions to family and friends.Many have not left their homes since then, and even before.

The team employed machine-learning algorithms, together with data from the 2.7 million app users – many of whom have been tested for coronavirus – to work out the combination of symptoms that indicate an inidual is likely to have Covid-19.The team then focused on data from just over 2,600 twins to try to establish whether the symptoms experienced by those predicted to have Covid-19 was related to genetic makeup.More specifically, the team found a substantial genetic influence for the symptoms of fever, diarrhoea, delirium, and losses of taste and smell. By contrast, a hoarse voice, a cough, skipped meals, chest pain, and abdominal pain were not linked to genetic makeup.Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.“This disease is very weird, the way it has a very different presentation in the population in different people – what we are showing is that isn’t random,” Spector said. “It is not mainly due to where you live or who you have seen a lot of it is something innate about you.“I think you can say that your likelihood of getting it at all, or getting it severely, is under some genetic control.”The team hopes the findings will help scientists ascertain the mechanisms by which Covid-19 acts on the body, as well as offering a possible way to predict those most at risk from the disease.They say the results could also help researchers around the world identify genetic variants that play a role in explaining why some iniduals show no, or only mild, symptoms of Covid-19, which could in turn aid the development of drugs for the disease.But there were other possible targets, Spector said, noting that genetics were closely linked to the immune system and microbes found in the gut.“It reassures everyone that it is worth exploring this whole triangle of genes, immune system and gut microbes,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea62cd97323780edb64d5a795694c22408bb6176/0_841_3596_2159/master/3596.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3a6e7505ab5cba361a00b21f9f7005c","title":"running free spanish children released from lockdown in pictures","story":"After 45 days at home, children in Spain up to the age of 13 are allowed to leave their homes for an hour a day.

Photograph: Kin CheungAPAuthorities should consider requiring Leaving Cert students to wear face masks and to observe strict social distancing rules when exams get underway in late summer, according to a leading expert in infectious diseases.Last Friday, 50,000 students in Hong Kong were among the first in the world to begin their final secondary-school exams. All candidates were required to wear face masks and have their temperature checked when they arrived at exam halls. In addition, all desks were spaced up to 1.8m apart, while exam invigilators were required to wear masks and latex gloves.Professor Sam McConkey of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and an infectious diseases specialist, said Irish authorities should consider similar measures.“There’s lot of wisdom in what they are doing and, given that we’ll be holding our exams in a few months time, we can learn from what others are doing.”He said face masks should be considered for students in line with a broader examination of using them for the wider population. However, taking the temperature of students should not be necessary, he said, as research indicated these tests were often inaccurate.Prof McConkey noted that many of our exam halls and schools buildings may not be well ventilated, which underlined the need for appropriate public health measures. Two-metre social distancing rules should apply to students entering and leaving exam halls. On the benefits of face masks, he said latest research indicated that there could be significant transmission of the virus for up to two days before a person developed symptoms.“In some hospitals we started wearing them a few weeks ago any time we were close to patients. The HSE has since said that all staff should wear masks when they can’t keep a social distance,” he noted, highlighting regulations issued last week.Recommending public use of masks, however, should only be done if there was an adequate supply of such barriers to keep up with demand, he said.“Any plans we introduce need to be feasible and realistic. There is no point introducing measures if they can’t be implemented.”AdviceMinister for Education Joe McHugh said he had been seeking the advice of public health experts over what measures would be required for the exams to take place safely. He said he had taken advice from experts, including Dr Michael Ryan of the World Health Organisation and the Department of Health chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan.Mr McHugh said that officials would postpone finalising the Leaving Cert timetable to ensure authorities had access to the latest public health information. The Minister has announced that the exams are set to start on July 29th.Under current Covid-19 guidelines, anyone who shares an enclosed space with a confirmed case for more than two hours is defined as having had contact with the inidual. This could have implications for the duration of some exams, Mr McHugh pointed out.Some exam papers – such as English paper two and Irish paper two – last more than three hours. This has prompted politicians to suggest cutting the exam time and giving students fewer questions.Another option being examined by decision-makers involves holding one major exam each day and stretching the Leaving Cert timetable into early September.While many countries such as the UK, France and the Netherlands have cancelled their final secondary-school exams, China and Germany are among countries that are pressing ahead with theirs.In China, the ministry of education is planning health screening for students, along with requirements to disinfect examination venues and make sure they are well ventilated.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Mohd RasfanAFP via Getty ImagesDelays in reaching the weekly target of 100,000 coronavirus tests until the third week in May raise doubts about the State’s capacity to lift lockdown restriction when they expire next week. Health Service Executive chief executive Paul Reid said the health service would not reach the weekly target until later in May – after the latest restrictions expire on May 5th – despite its concerns about the capacity to meet the target set by by the Department of Health’s health emergency team 10 days ago.The 100,000 weekly tests is a critical step to help public-health experts track infection rates as lockdown measures are relaxed in order to assess whether they are leading to new Covid-19 cases. The weeks-long delay in meeting the testing target emerged as the department reported that another 26 people died from coronavirus, bringing the death toll to 1,087 in the Republic. There were a further 701 new confirmed cases, bringing the total number of known cases to 19,262. Mr Reid said the HSE had been operating on a “war zone” footing since the crisis began but a more sustainable model was needed to manage the virus “well into 2020, mostly likely into 2021”. He acknowledged that there were “constructive tensions” between the HSE and the department after its emergency team announce plans to ramp up testing to 100,000 suspected cases a week.‘Intense effort’The department said that “intense effort” was under way to set up a rapid testing system but it sidestepped a question about whether the delay in reaching target would lead to restrictions being extended beyond May 5th.Last night, Dr Mary Favier, president of the Irish College of General Practitioners, warned that – beyond testing – without a ramping up of “critical” contact tracing to identify others infected by a new case, there would be “a further inevitable surge in infection rates” that would place “significant additional pressures” on GPs and the wider healthcare services.New figures released on Sunday showed the already heavy strain being felt across the health system as it tackles the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 205,000 people around the globe.There are about 4,500 HSE staff out of work, either on sick leave in self-insolation with the virus or suspected symptoms or for other reasons such as difficulties in finding childcare.The HSE’s chief operations officer Anne O’Connor said at its weekly press briefing on Sunday that the absentee rate was a “challenge” for the health service. She highlighted the need for the State to support front-line healthcare workers with “childcare solutions”. The Government first promised childcare solutions for these workers in mid-March.It emerged at the briefing that only 150 private consultants have signed up to work as public-hospital consultants since the crisis began with the first Irish case on February 29th.Testing capacityEfforts to help increase testing capacity are extending beyond the public sector.One of the country’s largest universities, UCD, is asking the public to help the State’s main virus research lab ramp up testing capacity to be able to help efforts to lift lockdown measures.The public is being asked to contribute to a €1 million fundraising campaign that would increase Covid-19 testing capacity at the State’s National Virus Reference Laboratory – a key coronavirus testing hub – by 3,000 tests a day, from 7,000 to 10,000.UCD Foundation, the university’s charitable fundraising arm, said the crowdfunding campaign would fund the purchase of personal protective equipment and hand sanitiser to keep the lab running on constantly rotating work shift so as to create capacity to add a further 21,000 tests a week, a fifth of the HSE’s weekly target.The campaign aims “to save time and fill in the gaps” to support increased testing during the relaxation of lockdown measures, said UCD Foundation’s head of annual giving Mark McDonnell. “As everyone’s attention turns to easing restrictions safely, we want to help in as far as possible with whatever steps we can to avoid overburdening our hospitals with new cases,” he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Delicate balancing act between testing and restrictions, says chair of Expert Advisory GroupAppeal to Travellers to abide by HSE Covid-19 guidelines on funerals during pandemicGarda\u0026iacute appeal for witnesses to incident along N22 north of Co Kerry town on MondayMet \u0026Eacuteireann expecting temperatures to fall to close to zero on Monday nightOrganisers have found it impossible to stage Rose selections in centres around worldDoctors\u0026rsquo group wants more contact tracing to identify cases of infectionRemoval of ban on small group gatherings ranks second as pubs reopening ranks fifthIncoming head of Fiscal Advisory Council says severe austerity can be avoidedOperator of nursing home says if drug \u0026lsquoworks in hospitals why can it not be allowed in care homes?\u0026rsquo\u0026Oacute Cualann says it will restart work on second affordable housing project in BallymunFamily who exited homelessness last month tell of difficulties they faced in family hubHSE to launch pilot version of app but concerns grow over personal data storageGetting the right testing criteria for coronavirus presents an ongoing medical challengeIreland competing with Norway and Canada for two non-permanent seats on key UN bodyDemands include major national herd cut, mothballing third runway at Dublin AirportMore data needed to assess if Garda powers \u0026lsquoare being exercised proportionately\u0026rsquoWomen\u0026rsquos Aid urges people to report suspected abuse as calls to its service increaseIreland can learn from arrangements in other countries, says Prof Sam McConkeySome patients need to learn to \u0026lsquosit again, to stand again and walk\u0026rsquo after Covid-19Virus response co-ordinator, Dr Deborah Birx warns social distancing may last monthsStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4238790.1587971687!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus 2km limit is restriction most want lifted survey finds","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Emma Blake with her mural of The Police in south Dublin.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireRemoval of the 2km limit on movement and the ban on small gatherings are the restrictions most people want to see ended according to a survey of 35,000 people.It also found that 32 per cent of people postponed medical treatments or check-ups including GP appointments, operations, childhood vaccinations and pre and postnatal check-ups, while fertility treatments have also been stopped.The findings are from phase two of the Corona Citizens’ Science study a population-wide survey conducted by research teams at NUI Galway (NUIG) and Dublin City University (DCU) and looking at the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the associated restrictive measures on daily life in Ireland.The survey is being conducted online every two weeks, the last one on April 22nd and the next on May 6th.Professor of Health Systems at DCU Anthony Staines is joint research lead on the survey with epidemiologist and senior lecturer at NUIG Dr Akke Vellinga.Prof Staines said people are beginning to think quite seriously about what is going to happen next. They have made huge sacrifices and understand that lifting restrictions will be done in stages and that it is a case of “suck it and see”, he said.But he warned that they want clarity about the situation and specifics such as “is the Leaving Cert going to start on July 29th or not? People need to know.”On social restrictions, respondents were asked to rank, in order of preference, which of the limits imposed to curb the spread of the virus, they would like to see removed.The 2km limit ranked highest with 50 per cent of respondents putting it as their first preference for change followed by the removal of the ban on small group gatherings (37 per cent).Respondents ranked a return to work in third place with 33 per cent in favour and the re-opening of schools was fourth with 32 per cent support. The opening of shops, pubs and restaurants was ranked in fifth place by 48 per cent of respondents.Of the 35,000 surveyed - 10,830 people, representing 32 per cent of the survey - reported postponing medical treatment or check-ups of whom 55 per cent did so because the healthcare professional was not seeing any patients. Some 39 per cent said they did not want to create extra pressure in the health system and 26 per cent were concerned about the risk of contracting Covid-19.Postponed treatments included GP consultations (48 per cent), hospital medical examinations (14 per cent) and operations (6 per cent).Prof Staines said people clearly understood the need for the restrictions and while many mistakes have been made, the Government was very successful in communicating the requirement for the limits on activity and movement.“Important treatment is being delayed, and there will need to be a clear path to fixing this before queues in our healthcare system become intolerable,” he added.The survey also showed an increased interest in DIY activities with 42 per cent engaged in this activity with 60 per cent involved in gardening but walking remains the most popular activity with 90 per cent involved in this.Indoor exercise was carried out by 56 per cent of people and 35 per cent played board games.The participation rate was 71 per cent female and 29 per cent male with a mean age was 46, median age of 45. Approximately 50 per cent were aged between 35 and 54, 5 per cent were under the age of 25 and 11 per cent were 65 or older. Of the total respondents, 37 per cent had taken part in the first survey.Dublin accounted for most respondents at 41 per cent and Galway 14 per cent, Cork 7 per cent and all other counties were represented at less than 5 per cent.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4231819.1587147602!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus brexit a key issue says us special envoy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS special envoy for Northern Ireland Mick Mulvaney: “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal.”  Photograph: Al DragoBloombergThe US special envoy for Northern Ireland, Mick Mulvaney, has said he intends to travel to Northern Ireland as soon as the coronavirus restrictions are lifted, as he prepares to assume his post.Mr Mulvaney said a key focus for him in the coming weeks is how the Covid-19 crisis will impact on Brexit. The British government’s plan to deal with legacy issues from the Troubles, announced on March 18th, also promises to be a focus when normal life resumes, he said. Mr Mulvaney, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in March, had been scheduled to make his first visit to Northern Ireland as US special envoy next month. But the coronavirus has put that plan on hold. “I have been using the time to familiarise myself with the issues. Obviously, Covid-19 is the focus of everyone’s attention right now. It’s a very fluid situation,” he said, speaking from his home in South Carolina, the state he represented in Congress before joining the Trump administration. Like millions of people across the United States, the former White House chief of staff has been working from home where he is based with his wife and three children, as states have imposed stay-at-home restrictions. He says he will visit Northern Ireland “as soon as the door opens”.Interest in positionThe Irish-American politician has been communicating with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, and Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis in the past few weeks.He has also spoken to previous holders of the post, such as Richard Haass, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was appointed by George W Bush. Mr Mulvaney (52), who reportedly had expressed a long-held interest in the position that had been vacant since the end of the Obama presidency, said his appointment was a measure of the Trump administration’s interest in Northern Ireland and Brexit in particular. He said Mr Trump views the post as akin to the role held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who he appointed to manage the White House strategy on the Middle East. “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal – it’s a big deal just generally, and in terms of North-South relations – so he said to me: ‘Jared is going to go and take care of the Palestinians and Israelis, you make sure things go smoothly over there,” says Mr Mulvaney. The husband of Mr Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, is widely viewed to have had minimal success with bringing peace to the Middle East. Trump and PompeoMr Mulvaney visited Northern Ireland in February ahead of his appointment, where he met with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and the new permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, Madeline Alessandri. He also met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and US ambassador Ed Crawford, a Trump appointee, at Farmleigh.The role of Northern Ireland envoy falls under the remit of the US state department, and Mr Mulvaney will report to Mr Trump and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Mr Mulvaney was replaced as Mr Trump’s chief of staff by congressman Mark Meadows last month. Like many in the administration, Mr Mulvaney played down the risk of coronavirus as recently as late February.Asked if he missed working at the White House, he replied: “I’m always happy to be home, but it’s kind of strange to be out of Washington at this time.” He says he still talks to the president and points out that Mr Meadows is a friend of his. Both were co-founders of the Freedom Caucus on Capitol Hill, a group of conservative, Republican lawmakers.

The Russian coronavirus crisis response centre said that 50 more deaths of coronavirus patients were confirmed in the last 24 hours. In the number of confirmed coronavirus cases, Russia surpassed mainland China, which reported the total of 82,830 cases on Monday.New ZealandNew Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has said the country has stopped the “widespread, undetected community transmission” of Covid-19, as tough lockdown restrictions are scheduled to ease on Monday night. Ms Ardern said New Zealand had “avoided the worst” in the pandemic, but must continue to fight the virus.“There is no widespread undetected community transmission in New Zealand. We have won that battle. But we must remain vigilant if we are to keep it that way,” she said. At 11.59pm on Monday (1pm Irish time), New Zealand will lift its level-4 lockdown which has been in place for more than four weeks. During that time, almost all businesses have been closed, along with schools while the population has been asked to remain in their homes for all but supermarket visits and short walks. The country reported five new Covid-19 cases on Monday but has not seen widespread community transition and will allow a partial reopening of the economy. New Zealand has 1,456 confirmed cases and 17 deaths. Ms Ardern warned that in level-3 there were new risks - namely people coming into more contact with others. From midnight on Monday, certain businesses such as construction will be allowed to reopen, but social distancing rules will still apply. Level 3 will see retailers, restaurants and schools allowed to reopen on a smaller scale. Schools will reopen on Wednesday for children up to Year 10 (about 13 years old) who cannot study from home, or whose parents need to return to work. Workers will also be able to resume on-site work, provided they have a Covid-19 control plan in place, with appropriate health and safety and physical distancing measures. It is expected one million New Zealanders will return to work on Tuesday.AustraliaAustralians have been quick to embrace their government’s new voluntarycoronavirus tracking app, despite some privacy concerns. The government had hoped one million people would download COVIDSafe within five days after it was launched on Sunday evening. But by Monday morning, more than 1.1 million people had installed it. While downloading the app is voluntary, the government says 40 per cent of Australians, or 10 million people, need to acquire the app for it to be a success. So far, 83 people have died from the disease in Australia out of 6,711 cases, of whom 5,539 have recovered, according to government figures.Manufacturers, construction companies and some wholesalers will be allowed to reopen from May 4th, followed by retailers two weeks later. Restaurants and bars will be allowed to reopen fully from the beginning of June, although takeaway business will be possible earlier. In addition, parks will be allowed to reopen and limited family visits and funerals with no more than 15 people present will be permitted.Schools will not re-open until September. Italy’s death toll remains the heaviest in Europe, with more than 26,000 dead and almost 200,000 confirmed cases of the disease. But the number of new cases has been slowing and the number of patients in intensive care has been falling steadily.coronavirus since March 25th and the amount of Covid-19 patients in intensive care decreased. Deaths rose by 242 to 22,856, according to figures provided by the Health Ministry on Sunday. The number of new cases increased by 1,129 to 191,743.Spain recorded 331 new deaths in the past 24 hours, up from Sunday’s 288. The total death toll stands on Monday over 23,500, while the number of infections is over 200,000, according to the latest count of the Health Ministry, which records only cases confirmed through lab tests. Health authorities are rolling out on Monday an eight-week survey among 36,000 Spanish households with a series of tests that should shed light on what is the share of the population that has overcome the Covid-19 illness.In the UK, British prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce plans for easing a month-old coronavirus lockdown as early as this week after he returned to Downing Street on Sunday night, the  reported. The official number of deaths related to Covid-19 in hospitals across the United Kingdom rose to 20,732, up by 413 in 24 hours, while confirmed cases stood at 152,840, up by 4,463.AsiaMeanwhile, South Korea is looking at reopening schools as the number of cases begins to tail off.Authorities reported 10 new cases on Monday, the 26th straight day where this number has been in double figures.Using an active test-and-quarantine programme, South Korea has so far managed to slow its outbreak without imposing lockdowns or business bans.However, schools have been closed and remote-learning programmes set up in their place.Prime minster Chung Sye-kyun instructed education officials to prepare measures to ensure hygiene and enforce distance between students at schools so the government could announce a timeline for reopening schools no later than early May.Authorities in China reported three new cases on Monday and have now gone 12 days without recording a death relating to Covid-19.The coronavirus outbreak originated from the country, and 723 people remain in hospital suffering from the virus, while a further 1,000 are being kept in isolation.Beijing added one additional postmortem death to its count, raising China’s overall death toll to 4,633 from 82,830 cases.Of the new cases, two were imported and one was detected in the province of Heilongjiang bordering Russia, according to the National Health Commission.Singapore, which has one of Asia’s smallest populations, is emerging with the region’s biggest number of coronavirus cases after the world’s two most populous countries. The island-nation reported 931 new cases on Sunday, with the total number of infections exceeding 13,600, overtaking Japan. Only China and India have more cases in Asia. The majority of infections remains among migrant workers living in close quarters in dormitories, presenting a major setback to its early success in containing the spread of the virus. Its citizens and permanent residents made up just 15 of the new cases, the government said in a statement Sunday.Indian prime minister Narendra Modi has said the month-long ongoing lockdown has yielded positive results and that the country has managed to save “thousands of lives”. India last week eased the lockdown by allowing shops to reopen and manufacturing and farming activities to resume in rural areas to help millions of poor, daily-wage earners. But the economic costs of the nationwide lockdown continue to mount in a country of 1.3 billion people. Mr Modi, who put India under a strict lockdown on March 25th, did not say if the lockdown restrictions will extend after May 3rd. India has confirmed over 27,000 cases of the coronavirus, including 872 deaths.USThe US states of Colorado, Mississippi, Minnesota, Montana and Tennessee will join other states in the lifting of lockdown restrictions, as economists predict an unemployment rate of 16 per cent or higher for the month of April.New York governor Andrew Cuomo said some regions of the state might qualify to open sooner, “with certain precautions”, such as upstate New York, as the daily death toll was markedly lower on Sunday than it was on Saturday. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Sunday reported 928,619 cases of new coronavirus, an increase of 32,853 cases from its previous count, and said the number of deaths had risen by 2,020 to 52,459. – Reuters, PA, Bloomberg, Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4237432.1587747479!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barnier criticises uk over impasse in surreal brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels. An EU official said Mr Barnier was concerned about the prospect of not reaching agreement ahead of June extension deadline. Photograph: Olivier MatthysPoolAFP via Getty ImagesNo progress has been made in the areas of starkest disagreement between the European Union and the UK in week-long talks on the post-Brexit relationship, held over video conference due to the coronavirus pandemic.Lead EU negotiator Michel Barnier accused the British side of failing to engage seriously on some aspects, and said never before had such high-stakes talks had to take place under such time pressure, which was all the more difficult given the need to battle the pandemic and its severe economic fallout.“In this context, the negotiation that has occupied us this week may appear out of touch. It has even been qualified as surreal,” Mr Barnier said following the talks on Friday.Both EU and British sources said progress would have to seriously speed up in order for sufficient progress to be made, and an EU official said Mr Barnier was seriously worried about the prospect of not reaching an agreement.“They listen politely to us presenting our text, but they don’t engage in some of the areas where they don’t have an interest to reach an agreement,” a senior EU official said.“We don’t have much time, and we see that in some of the aspects that the British authorities know for us, the EU side, are indispensable to have an agreement in the end, they don’t want to move. This is why Michel Barnier is concerned.”It was the first of three rounds of talks scheduled to be held before June, when Britain will have its final chance to opt for more time to negotiate its future relationship with its biggest trading partner.British sources insisted that under no circumstances would they accept an extension of the transition period, which expires at the end of this year.If no deal can be agreed between the UK and the EU by then, they will automatically begin trading on default World Trade Organisation terms, which is forecast to deliver a deep blow to the British economy and to its nearest neighbours, particularly Ireland. Even if a deal is agreed, British negotiators say they are perusing an arrangement like those the EU has with Canada or Japan, which would entail significant barriers to trade.‘Level playing field’The four areas of greatest contention are on the so-called “level playing field”, on the governance of the deal, on police and judicial co-operation, and on fishing rights, an area on which Britain has yet to submit a legal text of its position for negotiation.The EU has said it will not grant tariff-free access to its single market unless Britain maintains labour and environmental standards and guarantees it will not intervene to give companies an unfair advantage. Britain has dismissed this as unacceptable.On governance, the EU wants a single overarching framework while the UK wants a series of separate arrangements. The EU insists that Britain should guarantee continued adherence to the European Convention on Human Rights, and that the European Court of Justice should be the final arbiter on disputes that touch on EU law. Britain rejects the jurisdiction of the ECJ entirely.“We will not make progress on the so called level playing field and the governance provisions until the EU drops its insistence on imposing conditions on the UK which are not found in the EU’s other trade agreements and which do not take account of the fact that we have left the EU as an independent state,” a British government spokesperson said.British sources said they had used the latest round of talks to challenge the EU’s argument that Britain’s size and proximity to the EU made level playing field commitments essential, and they defended British labour and environmental standards.They said there was no question of Britain continuing fishing quota agreements with other EU countries, which Brussels has proposed.The two sides meet for further rounds of talks starting on May 11th and June 1st ahead of a high-level meeting before the end of June which will make the final decision on extending the transition.Separately, the Specialised Committee on the Protocol on IrelandNorthern Ireland will meet next Thursday. The EU has emphasised that agreement of a deal depends on Britain demonstrating that it is enacting prior agreements, including on arrangements for trade between Britain and Northern Ireland, which the EU insists entails regulatory, sanitary and phytosanitary checks on goods entering the North from Britain.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph:  ReutersGonzalo FuentesThe French and Spanish governments will on Tuesday outline detailed plans to ease their lockdowns as more European countries seek to map out an exit route from the economically-damaging measures brought in to contain Covid-19. Leaders across the region are grappling with how to balance reopening the economy with keeping the coronavirus epidemic under control. Germany, which has had more success in containing the outbreak than some of its neighbours, began reopening shops last week, and plans to reopen schools early next month. On Sunday, French prime minister Edouard Philippe confirmed that he would present the “national deconfinement strategy” on Tuesday, with a focus on six themes: “health (including masks, testing and isolation), school, work, shops, transport and gatherings”.France is now in its sixth week of lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus, which has so far killed more than 22,600 people. This month, however, the number of people in hospital and intensive care have both fallen steadily. The country is due to gradually reopen from May 11th, with no decision taken on bars and restaurants until the end of that month.The plan for the country, said Mr Philippe on Twitter, will be put to parliament for a vote, before being presented to local politicians and other “social partners”, such as unions.In an opinion article published on Saturday, the government’s council of scientific advisers warned against relaxing the lockdown measures too quickly as it “could result in a rapid increase in the number of cases” and “serious cases in hospital and intensive care”.The council has advised that people keep working from home as much as possible, and – despite the government indicating that it intends to start reopening schools from May 11th – said it is against any return to schools or crèches before September.It also “strongly discouraged” international travel in “the months” after the lockdown ends to avoid the risk of quarantine abroad or as people return to France. SpainSpain is also planning to relax its six-week- coronavirus lockdown – one of the toughest in the world – in the coming days by allowing people to walk and exercise outdoors from the start of next month.In a televised address to the nation on Saturday night, prime minister Pedro Sánchez highlighted the country’s falling official daily death toll – on Sunday it fell to 288, the lowest for more than a month. He added that if the figures continued to improve the government would permit adults to go for walks and exercise outside their homes from May 2nd.His administration has already announced that as of Sunday, children under the age of 14 can go for walks of up to 1km from their homes if they are accompanied by an adult.Mr Sánchez warned, however, that the government planned to phase out the lockdown only slowly throughout the month of May and possibly June, with variations by region and sector. Unlike France, the Spanish government has also avoided giving specific dates for relaxing measures. “We have to be very prudent,” he said, arguing that the period of phasing out the lockdown would be as risky and as dangerous as the initial period of the pandemic, and that people would need to retain social distancing. “We will only win this battle definitively when we have a vaccine or a treatment that can serve as a remedy,” he said. Mr Sánchez is due to outline the government’s full plan to phase out the lockdown on Tuesday. Ahead of his remarks people in various parts of Spain protested against the government by banging pots and pans in their houses. ItalyItalian prime minster Giuseppe Conte said that details of his government’s plan to allow a large number of companies to reopen from May 4th would be made public at the start of next week “at the latest”. However, Mr Conte warned that the current restrictions would not be lifted, only revised, and he said the need for self-certification forms to be filled out by Italians would continue. Schools will remain closed until September, while bars and restaurants would not be allowed to immediately reopen in May.In the UK, pressure is growing on prime minister Boris Johnson to put forward an exit strategy from Britain’s current lockdown as he returns to work two weeks after being released from hospital.However, foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Sunday that it would be “irresponsible” to discuss ways of easing restrictions. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4238770.1587965323!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"italy prepares for staged end to lockdown beginning next week","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA woman buys a rose, symbol of the patron of Venice, Saint Mark, on his feast day during an unprecedented lockdown across the country imposed to slow the outbreak of the coronavirus disease in Venice, Italy on Sunday. Photograph: Manuel SilvestriItaly will allow factories and building sites to reopen from May 4th and permit limited family visits as it prepares a staged end to Europe’s longest coronavirus lockdown, prime minister Giuseppe Conte said on Sunday.More than two months after the first case of Covid-19 appeared in a small town outside Milan and following weeks of lockdown, Italy is looking ahead to a second phase of the crisis in which it will attempt to restart the economy without triggering a new wave of infections.“We expect a very complex challenge,” Mr Conte said as he outlined the road map to restarting activities put into hibernation since early March. “We will live with the virus and we will have to adopt every precaution possible.”Manufacturers, construction companies and some wholesalers will be allowed to reopen from May 4th, followed by retailers two weeks later. Restaurants and bars will be allowed to reopen fully from the beginning of June, although takeaway business will be possible earlier.“The reopening is allowed on condition that all companies involved strictly respect security protocols in the workplace,” Conte said, adding that the reopening would lay the ground for deeper reforms of the economy in the months ahead.In addition, parks will be allowed to reopen and limited family visits and funerals with no more than 15 people present will be permitted. But movement between regions remains suspended and people moving about will still have to carry a declaration explaining the reasons for their journeys.Museums and libraries can reopen from May 18th, when sports teams will also be able to resume group training, although Mr Conte said conditions would have to be assessed before any decision on resuming the top-flight Serie A soccer championship.Schools will remain shut, however, until the start of the new academic year in September, leaving families facing childcare problems for months to come.Economic impact The lockdown has put a strain on the euro zone’s third-largest economy, which is headed for its worst recession since the second World War. Italian business leaders have called for the restrictions to be eased to head off economic catastrophe.Mr Conte said the more limited restrictions would likely remain in place until the discovery of an effective vaccine or cure for Covid-19, which is not expected for many months.On Sunday, Italian authorities reported a third consecutive daily fall in coronavirus fatalities, with 260 deaths, the lowest number since March 14th.Italy’s death toll remains the heaviest in Europe, with more than 26,000 dead and almost 200,000 confirmed cases of the disease. But the number of new cases has been slowing and the number of patients in intensive care has been falling steadily.Hit hard by the virus weeks before other major Western countries, Italy has been forced to serve as a model for how to fight it. It is being closely watched around the world as it takes its early steps to chart a path out of a strict lockdown it imposed in early March.Some businesses deemed “strategic”, including activity that was mainly export-oriented, could reopen this week providing they get the go-ahead from local prefects.Exporting companies need to resume activity sooner to reduce the risk of being cut out of the production chain and losing business, Mr Conte said in an interview with the daily Repubblica earlier on Sunday.Rome has introduced a series of measures including state-backed loans to help businesses stay afloat. But some business officials have complained about delays in implementing them.Mr Conte said the government was monitoring banks to make sure state-guaranteed liquidity arrived to companies in need.He also said the government was working on a series of measures to help industry by cutting bureaucratic red tape.–Reuters Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: Boris Johnson says we are winning first battle against virus but must recognise danger of second spikeCoronavirus positive: good news round-up - The joy of freed Spanish childrenPublic to ask minister \u0026#39question a day\u0026#39 at daily coronavirus conference Comment: Boris Johnson knows his job is to lead the country sensibly out of coronavirus lockdownHow do I find a fruit and veg picking job near me - and how much will I earn?Ramadan 2020: fasting, prayer and how Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranComment: The Establishment talks tough about the lockdown but stays silent on illegal immigrationComment: Boris Johnson is back in charge, ready to plot our route out of coronavirus lockdownBoris Johnson\u0026#39s coronavirus speech in full ‘The hunger makes us forget the disease’: Famines threaten greater devastation than coronavirusChina threatens boycott of Australian goods over WHO spatComment: Boris Johnson is seizing his chance to be the new Churchill in his war on coronavirusNHS on alert over new coronavirus-related syndrome putting children in intensive careKim Yo Jong: who is North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u0026#39s younger sister?The Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayWhy are so many black and ethnic minority people dying from coronavirus?Dominic Raab hints at special guidelines for schools reopening after lockdownMonday morning news briefing: PM plots route out of lockdownWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"completion new genoa bridge gives italy much needed injection","story":"Nearly two years after it collapsed with the loss of 43 lives, Genoa’s giant Morandi bridge is about to be reborn - providing a much-needed morale boost for a country that has been left traumatised by Europe’s worst coronavirus outbreak.Engineers will on Monday install the final  in the massive steel and concrete structure – a moment of pride in a nation brought to its knees by the contagion, which has killed more than 25,000 people.“It’s the last piece,” Renzo Piano, the architect who designed the €120 million bridge, told The .“I hope it will be a symbol of hope for people. Italy is capable of miracles. The sad thing is, to make those miracles you often need a tragedy or an emergency first.”The 3,878 ft-long bridge collapsed during a thunderstorm in August 2018, sending cars and trucks plummeting to the valley below amid a tangle of smashed concrete pillars and twisted steel beams.More than 500 people were made homeless because the bridge collapsed in an urban valley packed with apartment blocks as well as a railway line and warehouses.Government promises to quickly rebuild the bridge were met with scepticism in a country in which infrastructure projects often drag on for decades, dogged by red tape and corruption.But Italy has this time confounded the naysayers - the bridge has been rebuilt in around 12 months. Once the surface is laid with asphalt, it will open to traffic.“Normally, building a bridge takes three or four years,” said Mr Piano, one of the world’s most renowned architects. “This bridge took one year. The secret lies in the fact that we started making the horizontal s at the same time as we were building the foundations. And we worked in three shifts, round-the-clock.”Famous in the UK for designing The Shard in London, Piano is a native of Genoa so the project has emotional significance for him. He designed the bridge to resemble a ship, in tribute to Genoa’s seafaring and boat-building heritage.It should last for a millennium or more, he said. “Europe is full of Roman bridges that were built 2,000 years ago. There is no reason why this one should not last as long – on one condition, that it is maintained well,” said Mr Piano, who lives in Paris.Even during the darkest days of the coronavirus crisis, which led to a national lockdown being imposed on March 9, the project did not stop, with 1,000 workers toiling around the clock.Construction teams had to follow strict health protocols, wearing masks, eating in canteens in staggered shifts and maintaining social distancing.One worker became infected with Covid-19, but he was quarantined and recovered.Before the virus struck, workers battled dreadful weather.“In the autumn it rained for 40 days and in mid-November the building site was flooded,” Siro Dal Zotto, project director for the construction company Fincantieri, said earlier this month.The bridge should be seen as “a symbol of how one can emerge from a terrible situation,” he said.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown begins fray britain realises cant live like","story":"This was the weekend the government always anticipated and feared: the weekend that public observance of the lockdown was put to its severest test yet.It wasn’t just inidual acts of rebellion, though there were plenty of those. Gloucestershire police had to turn back daytrippers from five different counties, including some who’d travelled more than 100 miles, while in Wiltshire police stopped an already disqualified driver doing 110mph on the M5 with five children on board. A party of 10 in two cars travelled more than 200 miles for a walk in Snowdonia, before being turned back by police. Gwent Police released a list of the best excuses they had received for flouting, including the foolhardy response to an officer of: I\u0027m taking my mate into Newport to buy drugs. No, it was more subtle and widespread than that: the feeling that wherever you looked, particularly in cities, people were thronging into public spaces without bothering too much about social distancing. Bournemouth esplanade was packed, while on Wimbledon Common plainclothes police appeared to step in to enforce government regulations after sunseekers brought out camping chairs. Stern words were also had in Greenwich Park, where scantily clad sunbathers were asked to put their trousers back on and make an exit. Police and the coastguard had to speak to a man in a similar state of undress who took a dip at Langland Bay in Swansea, and paddlers also ventured onto Warleigh Weir near Bath. One east London resident said a local park looked like ‘a Spanish beach resort’, complete with ice-cream van outside the gates. More than half of B\u0026ampQ’s 300 stores were open. So why the unravelling? There are five main reasons.Second, the great British weather has, with magnificent perversity, decided to shine bright and warm on us. You wait years for a pandemic and some sunshine, and they both come along at once. Small wonder that Andy Cooke, chief constable of Merseyside police, uttered a sentence rarely heard in this country: ‘We could do with some rain, really.’ Third, other countries are beginning to ease their rules. Germany has reopened bookshops and car dealerships. Children have returned to nurseries in Norway and some schools in Denmark. Swiss hair salons are open again. And of course Donald Trump has repeatedly stated his desire to have the United States back up and running as soon as possible. That these countries have different demographics, healthcare provision and infection rates than we do can appear less relevant than the simple iconography of the images: the virus is the same all over the world, so if they’re opening up then why can’t we?Fourth, every flouting of the rules, no matter how minor and apparently harmless, acts as the thin end of the wedge. You go for a bike ride with a friend and you’re both at pains to observe the two-metre rule, but next time someone else comes along and you have to squeeze closer to allow other people past, and it doesn’t seem the end of the world. Or you see other people disobeying the rules and think ‘well, if they’re not going to bother then why should I?’ Once these outer threads begin to unravel, it’s very hard to sew them up again.And finally, the political smoke signals are suggesting some alteration sooner or later, no matter how much the government protests otherwise. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps may say that ‘it isn’t over, we’re riding perhaps, we hope, a downward trend but it is by no means established yet’, but the authority of that message is undermined by the fact that the First Ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have already hinted at possible easing in their own areas, or by isions in the Cabinet over how to proceed, with Health Secretary Matt Hancock reportedly keen to keep strict measures in place while Chancellor Rishi Sunak is mindful of the need to get the economy moving again.But arguably the biggest political signifier is Boris Johnson’s return to work on Monday. The very personal nature of his leadership style means that there has been a definite sense of marking time while he’s been recovering from the virus: but now he’s back, and will this week face not just the biggest question of his premiership – when, where and how to ease the lockdown – but one with no right answer. A libertarian by instinct, he was reluctant to impose stringent restrictions in the first place, fearing that the public would only obey them for so long: and, though people have in general been more law-abiding than many in government expected, it seems that we’re finally beginning to prove him right after all.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"amazon ebay tackle price gouging virus profiteering product","story":"Millions of online product listings have been removed, thousands of sellers banned and hundreds of companies investigated as part of efforts to tackle price gouging and virus profiteering, analysis by The  has revealed.As the pandemic took hold and people were trying to stock up on supplies and purchase vital hygiene products including hand sanitiser and face masks, some unscrupulous sellers were trying to exploit the panic.There have been reports of multi-packs of hand sanitiser being sold online for £1,000, while small bottles have been seen in corner shops advertised for £15 each. Welsh Trading Standards officers said earlier this month they had received reports of Calpol being sold for £10, packs of toilet roll for £8.50 and even pasta sold by the handful.Analysis by this newspaper of new and previously published figures gives an indication of the scale of such profiteering. Yvonne Fovargue, the MP who chairs the parliamentary panel on consumer protection, said: “It is not surprising to see online scammers and sellers taking advantage of consumers in this confused and difficult time, but the extent of the abuse revealed by these figures is truly shocking.”The  can disclose that online marketplaces Amazon and eBay have removed or blocked more than 17 million product listings which were deemed to be exploiting the virus by offering inflated prices or making false claims.eBay has blocked more than 11 million attempts to price gouge and removed more than 800,000 listings. Wolfgang Weber, the site’s head of global regulatory, said: “We’ve seen some unscrupulous sellers unfairly hike prices on items including masks and hand sanitisers, as well as baby formula, nappies, toilet roll and feminine hygiene products.”He added: “Sellers attempting to list unreasonably priced items will find their listing blocked and see a display message explaining why they cannot list the item.”Amazon has blocked or removed hundreds of thousands of products from sale for price gouging and has blocked or removed 6.5 million listings for making inaccurate claims about the virus.The firm said its systems automatically compare price changes submitted by sellers with current and historic prices on the site and elsewhere and use price thresholds to determine whether they are fair.If a price breaks the site’s policy it will remove the offer and can take action against the seller, including passing details to enforcement agencies.A spokesman said: “There is no place for price gouging on Amazon. We are disappointed that bad actors are attempting to artificially raise prices on basic need products during a global health crisis.”Profiteering has not been limited to online platforms. The Competitions and Markets Authority watchdog has launched a taskforce dedicated to the pandemic.This week it revealed it has written to 187 businesses about large price increases of personal hygiene products, like hand sanitiser, and food. In total it has received 21,000 complaints related to Covid-19, although the majority relate to cancellations or refunds. It will lay out its next steps next week.Action is also being taken on various misleading claims. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, which monitors fake and counterfeit medical advice, said it has seen sellers making false claims about the effectiveness of anti-malarials and various “miracle” cures. It also said there had been reports of Covid-19 home-testing kits being put up for sale. No such kit has been approved and so it cannot be legally supplied, it said.It is currently investigating 14 cases of fake or unlicensed Covid-19 medical products.The Advertising Standards Authority has also taken action against several adverts which claimed that face masks or IV drips could help cure or prevent coronavirus.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"captain tom moores upcoming 100th birthday celebrated special","story":"All mail sent from Monday will be stamped with a special postmark to celebrate the upcoming 100th birthday of NHS fundraiser Captain Tom Moore.The Royal Mail postmark, which will be applied to all stamped post between April 26 and May 1, reads: Happy 100th Birthday Captain Thomas Moore NHS fundraising hero 30th April 2020.The Second World War veteran has raised more than £28 million for the NHS by walking laps of his garden in Bedfordshire ahead of his milestone birthday.His original target of £1,000 was broken in around 24 hours and he extended his challenge to 200 laps after he completed the first 100 14 days ahead of schedule.The postal recognition comes after Royal Mail had to adapt its sorting machines in the South Midlands Mail Centre to re-route all post to Captain Tom into a dedicated collection box.A spokesman said staff had already processed more than 100,000 cards using this new process and were expecting thousands more in the run-up to his birthday.David Gold, director of public affairs and policy at Royal Mail, said: What Captain Thomas Moore has achieved is truly phenomenal, and this is reflected in the affection shown for him across the world.As Royal Mail works to keep the country connected during these challenging times, we are honoured to issue a special postmark in celebration of his 100th birthday.We continued to deliver the many tens of thousands of birthday cards from well-wishers across the UK and abroad as people look to show their gratitude for all he has achieved on a more personal level.We would like to extend our own best wishes and congratulations to him from everyone at Royal Mail.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2020/04/16/TELEMMGLPICT000229681865_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth","title":"does really mean follow science","story":"Matt Hancock speaks at the opening of NHS Nightingale in Birmingham.Last week, doctors Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi of Bakersfield, California, gave a press conference in which they made some startling claims. They took the test result data we currently have and extrapolated it out across the population. From this they concluded that the number of infected is probably in the millions, which is alarming, but it puts the total number of deaths in perspective: it could mean that the mortality rate for Covid-19 is as low as about 0.1 per cent.The implication is that the lockdown was a mistake – in fact, Erickson and Massihi argued that by staying indoors we are weakening our immune systems. When we finally return to work, said Massihi, expect a “huge amount of illness” because we have not been exposing ourselves to the kinds of “good bacteria” that help us cope with other dangers.I would challenge the doctors’ use of data. We have largely been testing carers and people with symptoms, so I think it is wrong to assume the figures we have reflect the health of the wider population. Their thoughts on immunity do make sense to me because I was told as a child to play in the dirt because it is good for you, and it is thought that one reason polio returned with a vengeance in the late 1800s is because we had lost our immunity thanks to better hygiene. However, another Bakersfield physician, Dr Navin Amin, insisted that his peers are completely wrong and “social isolation has ... no effect on the immune system at all”. That doctors – all experts – can disagree on something so fundamental begs the question: What does it actually mean when politicians say we are “following the science”?Science is all about the collection and observation of data, but at the beginning of the crisis we had barely any to work with (we are still in the dark now), and while it is true that the public health consensus supported the lockdown, a few scientists did criticise it (the Stanford epidemiologist John Ioannidis compared it to an elephant being surprised by a cat and jumping off a cliff). Countries with slightly softer lockdowns – Sweden or Latvia – insist just as strongly as Britain that they have been “following the science.” Some commentators write that we are witnessing a renaissance in public faith in expertise, but when the recession is finally felt and all the errors we have made are tallied, faith might wither. Were we following the science when the Government dismissed the necessity of wearing masks in public or refused to shut down major events? How about when it advised that hospital patients who had been diagnosed with Covid-19 could be discharged back into care homes?In an essay on the University of Cambridge website, Professor Gordon Dougan of the department of medicine poses himself various questions about coronavirus – “Will it burn out?”, “Can it hide in immune people?”, “Will it go away?” – and his answers are refreshingly honest: “We do not really know”, “We hope not” and “We hope so but it is not certain”. “What is the value of experts like me?” asks Prof Dougan. The answer: “We are all trying to take informed guesses.” Now, if Boris Johnson said that at a press conference, I doubt people would go out into the street and clap.The point is that science is not a religion or an ideology, with all the certainties those entail it is a method of analysis, and as such it ought to be accompanied by doubt and debate. Public policy has displayed neither. On the contrary, when a minister politely states that he is “following the science” what it translates into is, “Shut up and sit down, you don’t know what you’re talking about”, which may well be true (I suspect I only passed GCSE biology because it involved drawing flowers) – except that science without data is just theory and some theories about what should be done are confusingly different from others. Politicians would love us to believe that policy informed by experts is merely the application of reason, but it is funny how so much expertise reinforces the ideologies of its time. Experts supported banking deregulation and the Iraq War.Are Erickson and Massihi right or wrong? I haven’t a clue. I choose to follow government advice, not for my own sake but for the safety of others – but we all know that human beings interpret facts as they wish. If this is the peak and deaths do decline, some will say it validates the lockdown, others that it proves the lockdown was never necessary. Whatever. Let’s just open some wine, enjoy the sunshine and agree not to let “the science” become a shield for covering political decisions and political mistakes.One thing I refuse to believe is that the glorious and immortal leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, is dead. It is a capitalist lie. He is simply going for the world record for holding one’s breath. The current holder is his grandfather, who has been holding his breath since 1994 and is still listed as the country’s “eternal president.” North Koreans are world leaders in holding their breath. Millions have been doing it since the Kims came to power.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

But the company has now paused the availability of that and some other categories as it deals with false stories around the pandemic.Other topics including conspiracy theory appear to have disappeared from the list, and a Facebook spokesperson confirmed to Reuters that other categories were being hidden as it evaluates the different audience categories.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe removal came after a report that demonstrated it was possible to pick people interested in pseudoscience for targeting with particular posts, presumably allowing them to be targeted with false or misleading information.Such people would not necessarily know they were thought to be interested in such a topic, and would not have given any explicit indication that they were. Instead, the tag was probably added by automated systems based on the kinds of content they engage with.The Markup demonstrated that Facebook was allowing such ads after saying it would police COVID-19 misinformation on its platform. More than 78 million Facebook users were interested in pseudoscience, it said, citing Facebook\u0027s ad portal.Misinformation about the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, from bogus cures to wide-ranging conspiracy theories, has also spread on rival social media platforms such Twitter Inc and YouTube, the video service of Alphabet Inc\u0027s Google.Advocacy group Avaaz reported last week that a sample of 104 coronavirus-related pieces of misinformation content on Facebook analyzed by the group had reached over 117 million estimated views.Data gathered by ProPublica in 2016 shows that Facebook assigned pseudoscience to users at that time, suggesting the category has been available for several years.The Facebook spokeswoman said in her email that the pseudoscience category should have been removed in a previous review.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

I wouldn’t even tell myself to live my life.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe continues: “If you see me in the morning doing my daily run, my half-marathon around Barry, don’t even think about breaking that two-metre rule, because if you does, I will not hesitate to tell you quite clearly to ‘back off’.“Because at the end of the day, when all is said and done, no word of a lie if truth be told, just because you don’t feel ill don’t mean you’re not infectious, you could be riddled.”The second episode of SNL at Home was awkward in the best wayBrad Pitt destroys Trump with Dr Anthony Fauci impersonation on SNLHuge list of secret Netflix codes unlock hidden films and TV showsNessa signed off the video as she added: “Stay safe, stay out of my way and protect the NHS, obviously it goes without saying.”A number of other celebrities have warned their fans to adhere to the lockdown rules.Liam Gallagher urged fans to wash their hands by singing “Champagne Soapernova”,\u0026nbspAdam Sandler and Jimmy Fallon sang a quarantine duet on The Tonight Show, and\u0026nbspRandy Newman wrote a social distancing song called “Stay Away”.Brad Pitt offered a superb impersonation of Dr Anthony Fauci, while Pete Davidson and Andy Samberg did a “Stuck in the House” rap.Read our review of the latest\u0026nbspSNL at Home\u0026nbspepisode here.Gavin and Stacey\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But a drop-off in older volunteers meant the food aid operation had to switch gears.“We adjusted so we can still make a difference to people going through a tough time,” said trustee Mansukh Morjaria. “We want to help as many as we possibly can. Our ethos is to feed people from all backgrounds –\u0026nbspand it means people of all backgrounds working together for the greater good.”How to support our campaignMr Morjaria, who picks up around 50 crates of produce from the food surplus charity twice a week, added: “We’re so grateful to The Felix Project – we depend up on them, and the supply of food has been a lifesaver for a lot of people.”The Harvest Church in Wembley is another of almost 300 charities, food banks and local projects across London that The Felix Project is currently supplying with fresh fruit, vegetables and non-perishable produce it rescues from restaurants, retailers and wholesalers.The evangelical church was forced to close its food bank because of an initial drop-off in older volunteers. The remaining team adapted by dropping off food packages at the homes of dozens of people in the local area, and putting together meals for around 100 people at a south London homeless shelter in need of regular food.“The deliveries have been really important to people,” said coordinator Hilda Darko. “We have been in touch with families struggling to get to supermarkets because they’re self-isolating or having serious money problems.”She added: “The extra need will be there for a while to come so we’ll trying to help everyone we can.

The group of Muslim volunteers feeds between 50 and 60 people at the “soup and smiles” project on a Wednesday evening – while carefully observing social distancing rules.“We decided to carry on doing the work because there are people still sleeping rough,” said project leader Adeel Mahmood. “Some others are still struggling to get food, even if they’re in hostels or put up in hotels temporarily. These are some of the most vulnerable in society, so it’s important to carry on meeting the need.”The Myriad Foundation has also responded to the crisis by getting food packages out to around 170 vulnerable people on a near-daily basis – including many in dire financial hardship because of job losses and struggles to access universal credit quickly.“We had an inidual contact us who hadn’t eaten for two days,” said Mr Mahmood. “Things can get desperate quite quickly. From an Islamic perspective, there’s a big emphasis on giving to the whole community. So anyone who gets in touch, we will try to help them.”Olivia Colman joins our Help The Hungry campaignThe Midland\u0026nbspLangar\u0026nbspSeva\u0026nbspSociety, a Birmingham-based Sikh charity, has been delivering food packages filled with £30 worth of groceries to hundreds of people each week\u0026nbspwho are self-isolating or struggling financially.It has also been delivering lunches to several hospitals across the Midlands three or four times a week, and offering hot meals to around 200 people in central Birmingham every evening, seven days a week.“The reaction from local restaurants and supermarkets and members of the public helping supply us with food has been amazing,” said coordinator\u0026nbspRandhir\u0026nbspSingh\u0026nbspHeer.“Our principle is to serve the whole community with compassion.

Indeed, they have become four times as frequent\u0026nbspin the past half-century.Since the 1970s, it is\u0026nbspestimated at least three dozen infectious diseases have emerged from human interference with animals, including Sars, Mers, Ebola, bird flu, swine flu and the Zika virus. As far back as 2007 the World Health Organisation warned that infectious diseases were emerging at a rate that had not been seen before.The spread of the viruses is put down to a deadly combination of wildlife trafficking and consumption, increasing human encroachment into wildlife habitats as more people live in densely populated areas – and air travel, which enables pathogens to take hold globally.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThree years ago, an article\u0026nbsppublished by the US National Centre for Biotechnology Information stated, presciently: “The Aids and influenza pandemics have claimed and will continue to claim millions of lives. The recent Sars and Ebola epidemics have threatened populations across borders. The emergence of Mers may well be warning signals of a nascent pandemic threat.”Zoonotic diseases are complex, and it’s sometimes impossible to say a virus has disappeared, because it might have many different strains, and might mutate and lie dormant. This is a timeline of the main zoonotic diseases to have hit us since the start of the 20th century:Wildlife trade continues in Asia amid calls for restrictions China tries to shut down wildlife trade but markets remain openBlack-market trade ‘may undermine Vietnam ban on disease-rife markets’Stray dogs eating bat meat ‘could have sparked coronavirus pandemic’The 1918 flu pandemic: This was the most severe pandemic in modern times, killing at least 50 million people in two years. It is widely believed that the virus originated in birds because it shared genetic mutations with the bird flu virus later found in Asia, and could have transferred to horses in the trenches of the first world war before spreading to humans. This is disputed, with one study suggesting it came from mammals.Asian flu, 1957:\u0026nbspIn February 1957, a new influenza virus, known as H2N2 emerged in east Asia, which spread into a pandemic. It originated from an avian influenza virus, causing an estimated 1.1 million deaths worldwide.HIV: First identified in 1981, the disease is thought to have been acquired by people in central Africa hunting chimpanzees and coming into contact with their infected blood. However, studies show that HIV may have jumped from apes to humans as far back as the late 1800s, and it has existed in the West since at least the mid to late 1970s. HIV has killed about 35 million people to date, according to the World Health Organisation.Sars:\u0026nbspSevere acute respiratory syndrome is another type of coronavirus, which killed at least 770 people globally in an epidemic in 2002-3. Most victims were in southern China, Vietnam and Singapore. Scientists are not certain of its origins but like Covid-19 it’s thought it could have come from bats and spread to other animals such as civet cats, which are commonly sold in squalid conditions in street markets. The epidemic resulted in more than 8,000 cases, in 26 countries. Of those, 774 died.Swine flu: In 2009-2010 a new strain of flu emerged in pigs in Mexico. The H1N1 virus killed nearly tens of thousands of people in a global pandemic that spread to 214 countries in less than a year. However, overall the outbreak was not as serious as originally predicted, largely because many older people were already immune to it. And the NHS says it now circulates each year and is considered a normal seasonal flu strain, which is covered by the annual seasonal flu vaccine. A study in 2013 suggested between 123,000 and 200,000 people globally may have died as a result of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.Mers:\u0026nbspFirst identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome is also a coronavirus whose symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. With an estimated death rate of 35 per cent, the disease has killed 858 people, according to the WHO. Again, scientists think it spread to humans from bats, this time via camels.Ebola: A 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976, killing 11,300 people. Scientists say it began with a child in Guinea who came into contact with infected bats, but it has since been widely linked to the killing and butchering of bush meat, including monkeys, chimps, antelopes, fruit bats, porcupines and rats.Zika: First identified in Uganda in 1947 in monkeys, the mosquito-borne virus caused alarm in 2015, when it was thought to be the cause of thousands of cases of microcephaly – a shorter-than-normal head – in babies in Brazil. Outbreaks soon appeared throughout the Americas, Africa and other regions. It was thought to have killed 29 babies.Bird flu: Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, has many different strains but one of those, H7N9, has caused 1,568 cases in humans and 616 deaths worldwide since 2013, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.Another strain of the virus, H5N1, first identified in 1997, spread across east and southeast Asia, killing six people in Hong Kong and leading to vast swathes of chickens and turkeys – from Hong Kong to Britain – having to be culled early after contracting the disease. To date 861 cases of human H5N1 infection and 455 deaths have been reported.\u0026nbspThe highest number of infections and deaths were in Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand. The H5N1 virus, which has a 60 per cent mortality rate among infected humans, according to WHO, has not gone away, but is thought to have mutated.Bird flu has been linked to rapid intensification of the poultry industry, with thousands of birds crowded together indoors and with compromised immune systems.The Independent is campaigning against the wildlife trade at the core of the Covid-19 pandemic.\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is a charity that has adapted with incredible speed to the crisis to help the most vulnerable in our community. In just five weeks, they have responded to the increased demand for food by quadrupling their output. We hope that our donation, coupled with the campaigning power of The Independent, will help the project grow and reach as many as possible of the one in five Londoners at risk of food poverty.”Another substantial contribution came in yesterday from the Julia and Hans Rausing Trust, which has assigned £16.5m\u0026nbspto charities at the forefront of the coronavirus pandemic and has donated £50,000 to our appeal.How to support our campaignJulia and Hans Rausing,\u0026nbspheirs of food packing giant Tetra Pak, said: “We have been impressed not only by the speed of The Felix Project’s response to the crisis, but the way in which they have managed to get a number of organisations working together to help people across the capital. Efforts like this support communities across London at this time of need, and we are glad to support their inspiring work.”We launched our appeal, in association with the Evening Standard, on Friday 27 March\u0026nbspand have reached £3m\u0026nbspthanks to the generous backing of dozens of London foundations, philanthropists and corporations, including Garfield Weston Foundation, Lansdowne Partners, the Westminster Foundation, Sir Peter Blake, Burberry, Eranda Rothschild Foundation, Citibank and investment holding company Temasek.More than 1,170 members of the public have contributed, donating £103,837 on our Virgin Money Giving page.But there is a sense that we are still in the foothills of the economic crisis, with experts warning the government that food poverty is about to get far worse. The Food Foundation has reported that eight million people in Britain face food insecurity and that three million have been missing meals since lockdown. The Institute for Social and Economic Research at University of Essex estimates that 6.5 million jobs could be lost in the coming months, causing a huge rise in demand for free food.As the biggest supplier of free food in London, The Felix Project has been operating 12 hours a day, six days a week, distributing surplus food to giant community hubs, including Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in Haringey, as well as to 80 charities and schools across the capital.The Independent\u0026nbspis encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

But as the country fights its greatest health crisis in a century, it also has an estimated three million people going hungry during the lockdown. The coronavirus pandemic has shown why the National Health Service is of such immense importance. What if there could be a National Food Service too?There is in fact a project bearing that very name. The National Food Service is a network of initiatives committed to tackling food insecurity, social isolation and food waste. It is currently made up of 13 branches stretching from Glasgow to Falmouth and over the last few weeks it has begun to forge new links all over the country. It will not stop there. “We think there should be a National Food Service in every city of the country. That’s the aim,” says Selina Treuherz, one of the activists behind the service.That may sound incredibly ambitious but Treuherz argues that the foundations of what the NFS is attempting to create already exist. Thousands of local groups have led the fight against hunger in their communities for the best part of a decade or more. “What we’re saying is we don’t need the state to come in and build a National Food Service,” she explains. “It’s just about working together to make it stronger and to strengthen the communities in the areas that need it most.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn practice, that means social eating spaces where those in need can come and enjoy a meal with others. “I feel like we are proving it can be done now,” Treuherz adds. “Our founding branch, Food Hall in Sheffield\u0026nbspwhere I volunteer, has been running for five years. We’ve been serving the community on a contribute-what-you-can basis. It might seem like a radical idea but it’s not at all. It’s just people helping each other with the means that they can.”A fully realised NFS would not be government-run like its health equivalent. Each existing branch in the network is autonomous. They share values, resources and the same overarching goal – to ensure that nobody goes hungry – but they operate independently and in different ways to each other. This means there is “not a single point of weakness”, Treuherz says, such as an over-reliance on central funding. The NFS is only beholden to the people it helps feed. “We’re built by each community for the community.”But the pandemic presents new challenges. An organisation designed to bring people together through food is now having to focus on merely feeding them and support is needed. NFS branches are still operating, making around 3,000 meals since the lockdown began and delivering food parcels to communities in need, but they have found that they are often required to step in where the response from local government is falling short.“If I’m honest, I’ve been on the helpline quite a lot and the government response is pretty shocking,” says Treuherz. “We’re getting a lot of people ringing up saying they’ve had one parcel and been told that’s their lot, and they’re on their own in the house.” The parcels supplied by councils have often been low on food. Even when the boxes are full, they can be of little nutritional value.Food waste has also increased following the wave of stockpiling at the beginning of the crisis. The branch at which Treuherz volunteers in Sheffield used surplus stock from supermarkets to help feed those in need but they are currently struggling to meet demand.\u0026nbsp“We actually can’t get enough food to feed enough people,” she says. “It’s really sad.

But we must remain vigilant if we are to keep it that way,” the prime minister said.Jacinda Ardern is showing world how to lead a country through a crisisNew Zealand’s coronavirus strategy has been designed to prevent a major epidemic by introducing strict measures early to keep case numbers low, forcing officials to move quickly to a so-called lockdown on 25 March, which saw schools, nonessential workplaces and social gatherings closed.“Elimination means we may well reach zero, but we may well then have small numbers of cases coming up again,” Ms Ardern said, noting that small increases in case numbers would not mean the strategy had failed.The county has recorded less than 1,500 cases of Covid-19 and only 19 deaths as of Monday, according to data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre.However, while New Zealand’s approach has appeared to be successful in containing the virus, Ms Ardern\u0026nbspwarned social distancing restrictions would\u0026nbspstill apply.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus Podcast“We are opening up the economy, but we\u0027re not opening up people\u0027s social lives,” she added.From midnight on Monday, certain businesses such as construction companies will be allowed to reopen, while the public has been told to stick to a small “bubble” of close friends or family and to stay 2m (6ft) away from other people.Mass gatherings and shopping centres will remain closed for now, while most children will remain away from school.The country’s border will also remain closed.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The city lived a normal life. People were sunbathing on the beach.”But the warning signs were there.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSoviet Union officials were driving the streets, hiding their monitors as they gauged the levels of radiation washing over the pedestrians they passed. Traders had been warned not to sell fresh greens and cabbages at the local market, and street sweepers were washing the streets with foam.But this had happened during a previous accident at the plant, of which there had been dozens in the past decade, and everything appeared to have been fine.Created with Sketch.Illegal tour of Chernobyl visits forgotten sites Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Evening in the ghost town of PripyatA gas mask hangs in a building inside the Chernobyl Exclusion ZoneRemains of Soviet propaganda in one of the barracks of the abandoned anti-aircraft base Volkhov near the Chernobyl NPPThe shell of a television stands inside a building in the Chernobyl exclusion zoneA children\u0027s play area inside the Chernobyl exclusion zoneA Soviet-era classroom in the Chernobyl exclusion zoneTourists inside the Chernobyl exclusion zoneDuga was a Soviet over-the-horizon (OTH) radar system used as part of the Soviet missile defense early-warning radar networkIn the Pripyat abandoned apartments you can still see the abandoned belongings of evacuated residents of the cityAmbulance car model RAF-2203 Latvija (nickname Rafik) on the background of the Medical Sanitary Unit 126 in Pripyat.

Rather than the collapse of the Berlin Wall, Chernobyl was “perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union”, he would later lament.But, as with the disaster itself, the true starting point of such catastrophe is hard to pinpoint.In the simplest sense, it began with a disastrous experiment during routine tests of reactor four. Technicians wished to see whether an emergency water-cooling system would work during a power outage and, shutting down the reactor’s emergency safety system, withdrew most of the control rods from its core while keeping the reactor running.Moments after their re-insertion, at 1.23am, the resulting reaction caused a partial meltdown in the core, summoning a large fireball that blew the 1,200-tonne concrete and steel lid from the reactor, which would spew roughly 400 times more radioactive material into the atmosphere than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.Two workers were immediately killed in the blast, which bent the plant’s thick concrete walls “like rubber”. Another plant worker, Sasha Yuvchenko,\u0026nbspwould later recall standing to watch as a pillar of blue ionising radiation ascended into the sky, “flooding up into infinity from the reactor”, reflecting:\u0026nbsp“I remember thinking how beautiful it was”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

According to Andreyev, who was working that night, their dosimeters were taken away and they were told told to wash their shoes in manganese solution before entering, suggesting the radiation on the streets of Pripyat was feared to be worse than inside the incinerated plant.The number of fatalities from this initial effort is still unknown, with the larger estimates suggesting 50 Soviet citizens lost their lives and scores more were hospitalised with gruesome and permanent injuries\u0026nbspas a result of their efforts to protect their community.\u0026nbspUntil late 1986, the official death toll would recognise only the two who died in the immediate blast.In those months, hundreds of thousands of emergency workers, troops, cleaners and miners were sent into the area during attempts to control the core meltdown and halt the spread of radioactive material, which\u0026nbspwould reach the US, China and northern Africa.Dubbed “liquidators”, some 600,000 workers seeking to contain the spread were given special status that provided compensation in the form of fiscal benefits and additional health care.While these liquidators\u0026nbspwere offered some compensation for their sacrifice, it appeared that Soviet authorities had known all along that there could be “accidents” at the nuclear plant.Documents published decades later by the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU), initially sent to the KGB in Moscow, suggested Chernobyl was subject to significant flaws throughout its construction, as early as its design stage, indicating materials used were sub-standard and that technicians often ignored safety regulations.In January 1979, a KGB report on the plant said: “According to operational data, there were deviations from design and violations of technology procedures during building and assembling works. It may lead to accidents”.The documents, released by the SBU in 2003, revealed that between 1977 and 1981\u0026nbspthere were 29 accidents at the nuclear plant.In 1982, another incident releasing what the documents described as “significant quantities of radiation” would lead officials to engage in a significant cover-up effort, but this relatively minor event\u0026nbspmerely foreshadowed the scale of the deception that would come four years later.While engineers and firefighters toiled to extinguish the blaze in the days following 26 April, officials sought to bury the true scale of the disaster from the outside world, and to uncover suspected foul play — interrogating first responders such as Yuvchenko\u0026nbspas they lay in hospital watching their bodies decay.The more immediate response was guided by a litany of deadly miscalculations from officials, whose dosimeters were unable to process the vast amounts of radiation, allowing them to believe the reactor remained intact.Some workers would defy orders, with Andreyev recalling how he and other colleagues, none of them wearing protective gear, shut off the other nuclear reactors in what he described as a lifesaving measure.Approximately 36 hours later, as officials began to acknowledge the huge scale of the problem, the order was given for Pripyat to be evacuated for three days. Most\u0026nbspresidents would never return.Efforts to downplay the scale of the disaster began within government itself — infamously exemplified by the Soviet\u0026nbspforeign affairs minister’s attempt\u0026nbspto allay a\u0026nbspmore senior official’s concern for residents’ health with the assertion that they were celebrating weddings, gardening, and “fishing in the Pripyat River”.Three days later, the alarm was raised by Sweden, where the radiation was picked up at a nuclear plant.The Soviet Union denied that an incident had occurred, but with\u0026nbspDenmark, Finland\u0026nbspand Norway also voicing concerns shortly afterwards, it eventually became impossible to hide the accident from the international community.However, Moscow continued to downplay the true scale of the catastrophe, failing to tell even its own citizens to stay indoors and allowing the capital’s May Day parade to go ahead a week later. The ensuing secrecy surrounding the handling of the disaster in the years that followed, and the reluctance to warn citizens of the scale of the danger they continued to face, means the true toll is continually being revised.The resulting suspicions\u0026nbspthat Moscow could not be trusted to tell the\u0026nbsptruth had directly devastating effects.It is believed that up to 200,000 women across western Europe chose to end wanted pregnancies on the mistaken advice of doctors who were mistrusting of the Soviet Union’s official line on radiation levels and who feared a possible rise in birth defects. There was no such increase in babies born with congenital defects, the World Health Organisation would conclude in 2005.One estimate by Kiev’s National Research Centre for Radiation Medicine suggests that in the former Soviet Union alone, five million people have suffered as a result of Chernobyl.More than 5,000 people who were children at the time\u0026nbspliving in the affected areas in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus, have since developed thyroid cancers, which the UN attributes to radiation exposure.While 330,000 people were moved out of the area, which now suffers far higher levels of poverty than other parts of the former Soviet Union, the upheaval proved “deeply traumatic” for many, according to the Chernobyl Forum.A 2005 report by the UN group found: “Even when resettlers were compensated and offered free houses, many retained a deep sense of injustice. Many are still unemployed, without a place in society and have little control over their lives. Some older resettlers may never adjust.”Amid decades\u0026nbspof concern of a predicted rise in cancers, clear scientific evidence of which is hard to ascertain, the psychological toll upon those still living in the affected zones is clear, with residents tending to be more likely to suffer with their mental health or alcohol abuse.Meanwhile, first responders are often forced to contend\u0026nbspnot only with the trauma of the event, but also a lingering stigma that has sometimes seen them shunned by peers fearful of a false radiation risk.“I try not to talk about it. I don’t want people to know about it,” Yuvchenko told the\u0026nbspNew Scientist\u0026nbspin 2004, at which point he still had to receive “constant” skin grafts.“I have been given two medals, an order of honour for my actions that night and a medal 10 years afterwards, but everybody got one of those. I try to get on with my everyday life. My neighbours don’t know who I am. There is a stigma attached to it.”In 2007,\u0026nbspa study of nearly 5,000 men involved in the cleanup effort between 1986 and 1991 found they suffered an increased risk of suicide, describing their findings as “concrete evidence that psychological consequences represent the largest public health problem caused by the accident to date”.It may have also proved fatal for the Soviet Union itself, which collapsed fewer than six years later — with the intermediate\u0026nbspperiod defined by public calls for greater transparency amid suspicions and anger over a perceived lack of public safety.Gorbachev, the last leader of the USSR, would define Chernobyl as a “turning point”, which “opened the possibility of much greater freedom of expression, to the point that the system as we knew it could no longer continue”.

British experts say smokers who contract coronavirus are more likely to end up in intensive care than non-smokers with it.The French health ministry has since banned online sales of nicotine products, and limited their sale in pharmacies.People will be allowed to buy only one month’s supply at pharmacies, and a register will be taken of everyone who purchases them.“A team of French researchers has written an interesting scientific article which tends to show that there are fewer patients in the population consuming nicotine,\u0026nbspand therefore smokers, than in the rest of the population,” health minister Olivier Veran told parliament.Lockdown has saved around 60,000 lives in France, study claims“But beware, this does not mean that tobacco protects. Tobacco kills,” Mr\u0026nbspVeran said, adding that more than 70,000 people die each year in France from smoking-related illnesses.The study also suggested that nicotine could prevent the virus from entering cells. The theory is that it could adhere to cell receptors, therefore blocking the virus and preventing it spreading in the body, according to Jean-Pierre Changeux from France’s Pasteur Institut, who also co-authored the study.The researchers are awaiting approval from health authorities to carry out further clinical trials.They plan to use nicotine patches on health workers at the hospital as a test.The sales restrictions are due to last until 11 May, when France is to begin easing lockdown measures and reopening schools.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But what needs to happen before the Government can justy relaxing measures It was reported on Sunday that Boris Johnson could set out his plan to ease the lockdown before the May  deadline.The Prime Minister, who ed to work on Sunday evening, has already discussed with ministers the idea of modying the lockdown restrictions before the deadline.Any change to the UK lockdown will involve modying it rather than lting it.Its understood that restrictions will stay in place evenworkplaces and schools reopen.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealA vaccine for Covid- is the ultimate goal but is likely to take at least six months to a year before its made available.Meanwhile, testing is of the utmost importance - with hopes being pinned on the antibody test, which can tella person has had the disease and is immune to it.So what needs to happen before lockdown can be lted On Friday Matt Hancock revealed that seven million of Englands key workers and their families would get coronavirus tests.At least  million people are thought to qualy for the tests now, No think, and thousands will be able to go back to worktheirs comes back negative.Brits without a car will be offered a home test, including swabs and instructions – with , kits sent out daily before the scheme is ramped up.They will be delivered by Amazon within  hours, before being collected the next day by Royal Mail.All those tested will get their results by text within  hours of having their swab taken.Mass testing is believed to be Britains exit strategy for beating coronavirus and lting the lockdown.According to University College Londons Professor Anthony Costello, the lockdown could be lted in six to eight weeksthe Government follows in the footsteps of South Korea - who have carried out , tests and got Covid- relatively under control.Meanwhile, Professor Neil Ferguson, whose team at Imperial College London has been advising the Government, hinted that current restrictions would almost certainly be lted once testing is ramped up. He told the BBC: “We want case numbers to get to a low point where we can start substituting other measures for the most intrusive and economically costly aspects of the current lockdown and almost certainly these additional measures will involve massively ramped up testing going back to trying to identy contacts of cases and stopping chains of transmission.“That can only feasibly be done when we have many fewer cases per day than we have at the moment.”The Government has rolled out plans to bump up mass testing.Other countries such as China and Germany have used mass testing to great effect to identy those most at risk and isolate areas where there are hotspots.The NHS is currently working on a contact tracing app which would noty peoplethey have come into close contact with someone who later tests positive for coronavirus.It will allow people to quickly self-isolate before spreading it to too many people.The strategy was successful in other countries including South Korea, where just  people have died from Covid-.The second strategy is social distancing - and the Governments rules are to stay at home and only leave the houseyou absolutely have to.Officials say the only reason you should be leaving your house are:These reasons are exceptions - but even when doing these activities, you should be minimising time spent outside of the home.You must also ensure you are two metres apart from anyone outside of your household.If you have even mild or seemingly unrelated symptoms then you must self isolate until days after they pass or you will infect others and that has a knock-on effect.Those who are at very high risk of coronavirus, such as the elderly or those with underlying conditions, have been asked to rigorously follow shielding measures in order to keep themselves safe.This group of highly vulnerable people have been written to by the NHS and advised to stay at home at all times.While the UK is past the containment stage, tracking is still important and will continue to be even once cases peak.Iceland, with a relatively small population of around ,, has been using detectives to track down potential contact cases and testing aggressively since the outset to isolate everyone, including those who are remotely at risk but show no symptoms.This draconian action, led by scientists and civil servants instead of politicians, has led to them becoming one of the only countries in the world not to enforce lockdown measures.Similar measures were used at the beginning of the outbreak in the UK but werent as effective and the country moved to the delay phase.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The new forecasts are cataclysmically worse than anything yet predicted.Despite the best efforts of Chancellor Rishi Sunak and his bailouts, the collapse in our growth and the scale of job losses are starting to look apocalyptic.Previous talk of a speedy recovery once the lockdown lts has been worryingly complacent.For many it will come too late.The damage will be permanent.One top economist says it “has pushed the economy into a recession of unprecedented speed and depth”.Another says business activity has collapsed “at a rate vastly exceeding the global financial crisis, confirming fears that GDP will slump to a degree thought unimaginable”.Remember where Britain was three months ago before Covid blindsided us.We were a powerhouse with minimal unemployment, jobs at historic highs, inflation low and pay rising healthily.We are now in deep trouble, like never before,we cannot get back to work.The Sun still backs the lockdown, while there remain so many deaths and the risk of a second, bigger wave of infections which could yet overwhelm the NHS.But it is vital the Government, despite its admirable determination to save lives, maintains focus on the immense harm being done to the country’s future.It needs an urgent strategy to mitigate that, alongside one to emerge from the lockdown as fast and safely as possible.Neither HS, at £billion, or our £billion foreign aid budget can surely now be sustainable.Tax cuts look crucial to fuel a spending and jobs revival.Meanwhile the public, admirably doing its bit by staying home, must also be alive to this economic meltdown.We must follow the social-distancing rules and wear masks where needed.But we should also be clamouring to get back to our jobs before they cease to exist.CAN you imagine what we’ll look like after six months without a decent haircut When the salons reopen there will be a stampede. Hairdressers will be instantly elevated to key worker status.We’ll bang pots and pans for them in the street every Thursday at pm.Before that we’re all going to have to learn to use scissors and clippers fast.If it goes wrong at least we’ll have masks to hide behind.IT’S not often we congratulate employment tribunals for their common sense.But one saw right through tech exec Rachel Power’s claim that she was sexually discriminated against by a boss who told her: “You got balls.”Everyone  knows it’s harmless slang for having guts.As for bringing a case over it . . . that really is a load of balls.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.

Will. Never. Happen.I adore the show and am glad it is on track toas usual later this year.But I know I would be very, very bad – and not in a funny Ed Ballsy way.I’d just be embarrassingly woeful. At the age of , I don’t want to be dragged around the dancefloor by the long-suffering Anton du Beck, showing off my knickers like Ann Widdecombe.I reckon the idea I might be involved in Strictly all started because of the ­glorious pro dancer Luba Mushtuk, who was paired with Olympic rower James Cracknell, last year and exited far too soon.We met each other at the Jason Vale health retreat, below, in February, where people go to recharge their batteries.It feels like a letime ago that we were all enjoying long walks, yoga and exercise classes, making new friends along the way.Luba very kindly gave us all a Strictly masterclass. I’ll never forget the hilarious lessons out in the sunshine – with a view of the lakes and hearing everyone’s laughter.Although I really enjoyed myself, it made me realise I could never, ever be a contestant on Strictly.My role is to watch the show from the comfort of my sofa with a large glass of wine and a jumbo bag of Revels.It is easy to criticise the ministers and health experts fighting Covid-.They must make le-or-death decisions with the information available and haven’t always got it right.But they are also human beings.This week England’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Dr Jenny Harries, told me she had been struck down by the virus, probably the day after Prime Minister Boris Johnson tested positive, and it left her feeling frail.With classic understatement, she called it an “unpleasant” experience.She was looked after by her children, one of whom is a junior doctor, and had to stay off work for ten days.This will have given her even greater insight into the disease and empathy with patients and their families.But it also makes us realise that behind the daily pm briefings are real people just trying to do their best.I’M still baffled by what to do when it comes to wearing a face mask.EvenI could get one, I don’t want to deprive a worker in the NHS, a care home or public transport, as these grafters are the priorities.We are told by some thatwe stay at home, and social-distance when we go out to the shops or for a bit of exercise, we don’t need to wear a mask.But that can feel problematicyou’re out shopping or on a bus or train.I will be making my own mask from the simple DIY instructions printed in The Sun earlier this week – it will be much better than nothing.But right now, there’s confusion and doubt, and it must be cleared up fast.NO ONE wants to put extra pressure on the NHS, and figures show we haven’t been going to AE or phoning ambulances unless we’re severely ill, which is laudable.But you can go too far.I would urge anyone who happens upon a lump or something suspicious to get help right away.Cancer specialists report a drastic fall in the number of people seeking help and fear a huge increase in cancer cases.So don’t think you are being a nuisance.A drastic, unexplained weight loss, a lump or change in a breast, or anything amiss with the testicles, must NEVER be ignored.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In Sweden, they say that everyone should rub up against one another when shopping, while in France they are ­ordering everyone to stay inside for another three weeks. Some boffins say that testing is the answer to Covid-. Some say it isn’t.Some say  is the age where you most need to worry. Some say it’s .Some say the virus will be wiped out by summer weather. Others say it won’t.And meanwhile, everyone is sitting at home thinking, “Can you lot make up your bloody minds.”But that’s the point of science. There should never be a ­consensus.Everything should constantly move as new discoveries are made. Emc until someone proves that it doesn’t.My colleague Rod Liddle explained last weekend that when the first atom bomb was about to be tested, none of the utterly brilliant men who’d designed it could agree on what would happen.Some said the explosion would be small. Some said it would be massive.One thought it might set the ­atmosphere on fire. One said it wouldn’t work at all.Today, we are told that all of science is agreed on global warming.We hear it IS happening and it IS our fault. No argument is allowed.History has taught us that this is ­dangerous.A hundred years ago, someone came up with a new idea called eugenics.The idea was that the human race was doomed because too many black and ­stupid people were having babies.We can see now that this is lazy, racist nonsense but back then it was a ­dferent story.Boffins at all the most prestigious ­institutions in America were captivated by it.They worked on it at Yale and ­Hard. Millions was spent on research.The greatest minds were taken in, Nobel Prize winners among them.HG Wells supported it and so did George Bernard Shaw and Alexander ­Graham Bell.Legislation was passed to promote it.Winston Churchill believed in it, as did US presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow ­Wilson.So just like global warming, we had an idea backed by leading politicians and many top celebrities.And anyone who said it was stupid was told to shut up.“We have science on our side” they screamed.Yeah, but they also had Hitler on their side.He believed so ­passionately in eugenics, he came up with the Aryan Nation, built concentration camps and murdered six ­million Jews.Be glad then that scientists can’t agree on what to do about Covid-.It shows they are ­thinking. When they say they all agree, it shows they’re not.EVERY European country has dferent ideas about which businesses can re-open next week and which ones cannot.But they’d all really like to give the green light to one thing: Hairdressers.I realise, of course, that everyone has now reverted to their original hair colour and that in Scotland it’s easy to spot the ginger roots of recession.But I just can’t see why this matters so much.

Not sure that’s going to work. Because what the planet wants and what people want are two very dferent things.What people want is to be warm and comfortable. We also want to be happy, which means we want a new sofa from DFS, a nice car, a couple of holidays every year and a fridge full of ice-cold beer.Charles would probably argue that the “people” he’s talking about are those who live in mud huts in Africa and Asia and bits of South America.Right. So what do they want  Well, I’m fairly sure thatyou asked them, they’d say they’d like a new sofa, a nice car, a holiday or two and a fridge full of ice-cool beer.That means we must build power stations and roads for them.We must dam their rivers and pull down their jungles to make way for sewerage and water pipes and factories and hospitals and shopping centres.I’m fairly confident then thatwe put people first, the planet is going to feel like we’ve trodden on its toe.I WAS out on my tractor this week, doing a safe and steady mph on a narrow country lane, when I noticed in one of the seven rear view mirrors that behind me, there was a small army of cyclists who couldn’t get past.Ooh, I was happy.I was so happy in fact, that when I got home, I drove right past the drive so that I could keep them all behind me a little bit longer.Payback.It’s so, so sweet.COUNCIL chiefs in Manchester say that the city has been so lovely and quiet these past few weeks that they are thinking of banning cars for ever.Really  You want to stop all those Cheshire boys coming into the city centre on a Friday night with their Ferraris and Bentleys Good luck with that.THIS week, we read about a builder who’d kept his we happy by turning his dumper truck into a luxury bath.He’d even used a drill attachment to create bubbles.Very clever but I knew a man in Doncaster back in the day who made his kids a swimming pool out of a skip.He tilted it so there was a deep end and even put a brazier underneath, so it was fully heated.WHETHER you’re doing a house-party or video conferencing with colleagues, it’s critically important you get the background correct.Tory MPs using Skype to do interviews on the evening news usually put themselves in front of a book case.This tells us they are wise and well read.Celebrities usually make sure there’s a bit of zebra skin in the shot and a pickled shark or two on the wall.This week, my friend Trinny Woodall hosted a live online make-up tutorial from her bathroom.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Doubtless she made sure the background was spick and span.

Millions are making huge sacrices to protect the NHS and save lives, while those on the frontline roll up their sleeves and get on with the job - showing the determination, grit and bravery that define our country.“I offer my endless thanks to those already doing sterling essential work and we want to match others who are keen to get involved with the critical roles that are out there right now.“This new jobsite does just that – whether it’s sorting parcels, helping pack online groceries or getting out on land helping with the summer harvest , these are the jobs critical to keeping the country well fed and ticking over while putting cash in the bank.”With more people stepping up and plugging vital gaps in our army of essential workers already doing their bit, they will join millions already serving on the frontline of the nation’s response to COVID-, helping keep the country running.Government guidelines require all employers to follow up to date advice on protecting employees in the workplace, including observing social distancing.The DWP site also has more than , important vacancies working across health and social care.

Is raising taxes the wrong approach or the Governments only option One surprise of this crisis has been how easily Britons have accepted the lockdown . Some people seem to positively enjoy it.To some it brings back the spirit of the Blitz a feeling of solidarity. To others fewer cars and planes are an indication of the more green lestyle we ought to be living.Its good that people have managed to cope with these restrictions. But when polls indicate that many people would be prepared to put up with a y extension of the lockdown I begin to worry.An economic interruption of this kind carries massive costs and can only be borne for a limited period. Any extension will become extremely dficult for the economy to bear.The OBR, the Governments independent forecaster, floated the possibility of a fall in output of the economy of  per cent for the period April to June.That is beyond anything that has previously been imagined. It wasn’t a definite forecast butit happened the effects on jobs and living standards would be more than devastating.Some describe this economic crisis as the worst in modern times. It may be the worst ever. That doesn’t mean we cant recover. We can and we certainly will.But its important to be patient. Commentators talk about the economy bouncing back, a so called V shaped recovery.This seems unlikely The economy may bounce back but only up to a certain point not necessarily the same point as before. Some firms will have gone out of business, others will have run up debts, some have missed orders that aren’t repeated.How long all these problems last depends on the lockdown. The longer the lockdown, the deeper the downturn. So it is vitally urgent that the Government relax the lockdown as soon as the scientists feel that the peak of the epidemic has been flattened and that it is appropriate.This isn’t about choosing the economy or lives. A flattened economy costs lives too. Even when we relax the lockdown many will still be nervous and may not want to go out to spend money.The continuing need for social distancing will pose problems for hospitality and other businesses and hold back a full recovery. Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor has been bold, promising to do “whatever it takes” to steer the economy through these perilous waters.His scheme for furloughing jobs with the Government paying up to £ a month of peoples wages has helped to prevent firms getting rid of people that they could not afford But it is eye wateringly expensive with costs estimated at up to £billion.Clearly it cannot continue indefinitely. Ironically the generosity of the scheme may have anaesthetised the public to the scale of the crisis we are facing.Butthe Government lts some of the restrictions soon and the economy starts to recover , what should the Chancellor do in his Budget in November  Of course we don’t know exactly what the figures will look like and we must wait to see before final judgements.Almost certainly he will be confronting a massively reduced economy, groaning under skyscraping debt, higher unemployment and only a gradual recovery.Horric as the borrowing figures will be it would be a mistake to move quickly to reduce the debt before the recovery is firmly established.He should let borrowing take the strain in the short term. Any measures to rein in the deficit should be for later. In order to boost jobs he might cut National Insurance or make a temporary cut in VAT designed to bring forward spending.Keir Starmer gave a menacing hint of his approach when he said there would have to be “a day of reckoning” and hinted at tax increases on the better off as though they were to blame.That would be precisely the wrong approach. As the economy gets back to maybe  per cent of where it was before the Chancellor needs to do all he can to support business.He has recently given some generous help to new high tech start ups. Well and good, but it will be important to continue to support existing businesses.It should never be forgotten that firms that have failed in this crisis have not failed though any fault of their own. This down turn is not a normal recession caused by market forces, a rise in interest rates or overheating.No this recession and the bankruptcies have been caused by the Government’s measures rightly introduced to contain the virus. So the Government should not feel embarrassed about continuing some of their schemes to support inidual businesses and indeed they have a duty to do so.The Chancellor sets the framework but ultimately growth does not come from Governments, it comes from iniduals and firms. The way to growth and recovery is to give them the freedom and the incentives and the rest will follow.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers. The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM. No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here: www.thesun whocareswinsappeal.Raising taxes in the current climate is not something the Government is likely to want to do.But the scale of the economic crisis now gripping the UK means they may end up feeling they have little option.So far the Chancellor has done what he had to do to protect businesses and workers from enforced shutdowns. The cost will have to come from somewhere.It is estimated the furloughing scheme alone will cost at least £billion. At the same time, tax receipts have noseed as earnings have decreased and fewer people are spending in the shops.As a result, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that public- sector borrowing will increase by an eye-watering £billion above the earlier forecast.The black hole in the country’s finances left by Covid- means that at some point, the Chancellor is going to have to face the uncomfortable issue of whether taxes will go up.Any rises must be set against the need to ensure nothing chokes the ­economic recovery, which will be vital.We must also guard against hitting the most hard-up in society. And ­crucially, we need to ensure we don’t make it unprofitable for dynamic small companies to operate.One option for the Chancellor is to target the big multi-nationals and billionaires who use tax havens to avoid paying their fair share.Yet we will also need to have big business on our side as we try to recover, so it is a delicate balancing act.Our priority right now still has to be protecting the vulnerable and health workers from another Covid- outbreak.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.But it is time too for the Government to think seriously about how to restart the economy as quickly as possible.Two days ago came news that Jaguar and Aston Martin will restart production in May.

The mask does look quite frightening so I try to reassure my patients.“Family members have asked me to stop working to protect my son, but I love being a nurse and feel proud that I can help.“I think the nation is finally beginning to recognise our value.”CLARE Batchelor, , works with the police and in her spare time foster dogs for a local rescue centre.Clare, from Axbridge, Somerset, said: “I work as a forensic paramedic at a local police station, caring for ­people brought into the cells.“People who have been arrested need to be assessed, blood and saliva swabs taken, injuries assessed and treated. It can also mean early detection of coronavirus symptoms.“When I get home, I foster dogs for rescue centres based in Cornwall, Devon and Wales.“Animals are being dumped as part of the Covid- crisis and I’m looking after them.”DANIELLE Whitham is a firefighter based in West Yorks.Alongside her regular duties, the -year-old is now helping vulnerable people by delivering prescriptions and pensions, as well as doing their ­shopping for them.Danielle said: “Since the ­lockdown we’ve been doing everything we can to help vulnerable people.“I sometimes stop for a friendly chat through the glass when I do my deliveries, and people are so grateful for the help.“Recently, I delivered shopping to a -year-old woman who is caring for her very unwell husband. She told me through tears that she wouldn’t be able to cope without us.“Last week, we drove to a hospital to clap for the staff, and many of them came out to clap for us in– I felt incredibly moved.“Members of the public have approached me in the supermarket to say what a good job we’re doing, and it means a lot to be appreciated.“It was lovely to get the Royal approval from Prince Philip too. I do worry about my health but I’m proud to be making a dference to people.“We’re all fighting this together.”JOHNIE Meharry, , is continuing to carry bus passengers in London, where  of his colleagues have died from Covid-.Driver Johnie said: “It is worrying to go to work. It is a hard time for everyone.“I have been driving every day this week and plenty of people are still using the buses in North London where I work.“At first the only protection we had was patching over the holes in our screens, but since last Monday the front doors on buses have been closed, so people have to board             at the rear. This definitely makes drivers feel a lot more comfortable.“The reaction of the public has largely been very ­positive.“I have been a bus driver for  years and I have never been thanked by passengers as much as I have in the past few weeks.“Drivers understand buses are an essential service, so that NHS workers and care staff can get to work.”ANDREW Catchpole heads London’s hVIVO lab — pioneering testing of new Covid- vaccines.The -year-old doctor said: “We have received a massive response from volunteers to take part in human testing with a non-deadly coronavirus.“Normally  would respond on our website in a week. This time we had , in a few days. People want to help.“We are trying to find a model that will speed up vaccine testing.“At the moment we are setting up the trial and testing the virus to ensure it is safe, before we put it into people. We will take healthy volunteers and inoculate them with a virus, making them sick but in a very controlled setting.“We are putting in lots of hours to get this running.”DESPITE being homeless, Monique Jones, , from Luton, is working in a care home for women with ­disabilities such as Down’s syndrome.She said: “Being a carer is incredibly rewarding. I work long hours but I feel I’m ­making a real dference.“I’m scared of catching the virus, but I’m young and we have PPE at work. I’ve been sofa surfing for over a year after being kicked out of home, so I worry about risking the health of people I stay with.Homeless charity Beam helped me get this job and on to a beauty course.“I’m glad to put aside my own challenges to help others.”MATT Spencer, from Banbury, Oxon, has been bringing in toilet rolls from home to give to vulnerable ­customers.The delivery driver, , said: “I love working for Sainsbury’s. People have been clapping and waving as we drive along — it’s a strange, but humbling experience.“We wear masks and gloves and I have been working  hours extra a week to keep up with demand.“I’ve had many vulnerable customers worried they might not be able to get essentials, so I started taking toilet rolls from home to help tide them over.“In one week, I gave out about  toilet rolls.”HISTORY teacher Georgina Bendall-Crawley is at Gable Hall secondary school in Corringham, Essex — taking classes of key workers’ children.Georgina, , said: “Usually there would be , students in the school — now there are ten to  so we are working with a skeleton staff.The pupils’ work is set remotely by their own teachers so we just sit with them, help and ensure they are safe.“Clearly I am worried about coronavirus but before lockdown I was teaching a class of  and sharing a canteen with  people.

We clean ‘hot areas’, which is where patients with Covid- symptoms are put, but I feel very safe doing it.“We have protective gear and it’s incinerated when we’re done.“Knowing we’re helping and making a dference is hugely important. A lot of my normal office cleans have been cancelled so I’m working on sites which have to stay open like factories.“This experience, while tough, has shown we’re all in this together.”LIAM Jeff, , has switched from the recycling centre to collecting bins during the Covid- crisis.The refuse worker, from Redcar, North Yorks, said: “We are getting on with the work, because it is essential that the rubbish and recycling is still collected.“We do our best to keep safe and get back home every day. We have always had hand sanitiser in the vans and now we’re using it a lot more.“Inevitably, a few staff have had to self-isolate so we need people like myself from recycling centres to help out. The public have been fantastic — they come out and clap during our rounds and leave thank you notes on bins.“I have worked in refuse for five years and have never experienced anything like this.”TAHIR Ali owns a Premier general store in Jarrow, Tyne and Wear, and has been delivering food and essentials to hospitals, vulnerable locals and food banks.Tahir, , said: “When I saw there were massive queues at the cash-and-carry a month ago, I realised people would need help getting food.“I wanted to give something back to the community, so started to deliver bread.“Then I drove all the way to Glasgow to collect a van full of toilet roll, and started to hand that out.“I have also been giving out hand sanitiser, and , snacks and  cases of water to two of my local hospitals – the nurses said they hadn’t had any bottled water.“I get tearful every time I do a delivery.

But Foreign Secretary Mr Raab insisted Britain was on target, and aiming higher.He told The Andrew Marr Show on BBC One: “Well, certainly we want to get , daily tests by the end of the month.”Askedthe , daily target — mentioned by Prime Minister Boris Johnson last month — was still the aim, he suggested it was.He said: “Well, we’ve certainly got to get the daily testing right up to hundreds of thousands.”Any ease in lockdown needed a hike in testing, tracking and tracing of cases, plus developing drugs to treat the virus, he said.An NHS phone app is being developed which will tell peoplethey have come into contact with an infected patient.An ,-strong army of human tracers will also help find and warn Brits at risk of infection.Ministers believe that by rigorously finding, testing and quarantining anyone with the virus they can help keep it muzzled as the search for a vaccine continues.Oxford University’s Professor Christophe Fraser, who is helping design the app, said up to around  per cent of Brits will need to download it — around million.Prof Fraser told the BBC yesterday: “We found that, for this intervention alone to stop resurgence of the epidemic, about  per cent of the population would have to use the app.“Now that number may be a bit smallerthere were other interventions going on which we hope there will be — social distancing, large community testing and indeed manual contract tracing.”It came amid reports the Government had ordered production of up to million new antibody tests by late summer.It is hoped the pinprick blood tests could tellBrits have previously had the virus and have built up immunity to it. But health sources last night warned it is not yet knownit is reliable enough to be rolled out.Ministers have bought millions of ious types of these antibody kits in the hope one will work.But so far chief medical officer Chris Whitty has warned they are not reliable enough to telliniduals have immunity.Meanwhile, testing slots for key workers ran out for the third day in a row — amid a warning from the British Medical Association.More than million essential workers and their families are now eligible for free checks. But kits were listed as “unavailable” on the Government’s website yesterday — two hours after booking reopened.After its launch on Friday, slots for home-testing and drive-through centres have been used up within the first few hours.BMA council chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said the online booking system “offered no practical help” to healthcare workers because it had insufficient capacity.He said: “There is no point putting forward a proposal unless it’s matched with adequate capacity.”He added: “If the Government wants healthcare workers to have access to the test, it has to be in the context of providing adequate capacity, not a ‘first come first served’ and closing within an hour.”He added: “Our estimate is that there are about , health and care staff self-isolating based upon the Government figures of absence rates. With that in mind,they all wanted to have a test, clearly capacity has to match that number on that assumption.”The Department of Health said slots and kits are available daily at am, and others will get a staggered release throughout the day.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

But the dam is bursting.The trickle back to work is turning into a flood. People are still keeping their distance, but they are taking their hard hats on the Tube, visiting garden centres, coffee shops, parks — and, best of all, reuniting with their families.When Boris Johnson s from his sick bed on Monday, he must get ahead of this fast- moving curve. He needs to show he is back in charge.The PM has plans, yet to be announced, for “non-essential” stores to open. Next will be schools. This will be the “new normal”. Perhaps they should never have been shut in the first place.Polls show people will self-isolate, risk their jobs and keep indoors to save the NHSasked — but not land their children and grandchildren with the bill.They will endure a few more days of enforced sunshine but six weeks is long enough.Britain’s death toll has passed , — among Europe’s highest but far below last month’s scary , worst-case scenario.Lockdown has worked. It has taken pressure off the NHS. The “sombrero” curve has been flattened.Crucially, we now have spare hospital capacity and, despite a shortage of protective equipment, our NHS frontline has avoided meltdown.Yet we continue to hear the dismal dirge, “Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives”, to the muffled drums of the BBC and its throat-slitting Thought For The Day.While some are breaking those rules, many more — especially the over-s — are too terried to poke their nose outdoors evenit’s safe.So non-Covid hospital wards are empty and countless worried patients are missing le-saving treatment for cancer, kidney or heart disease.Others in lockdown are prone to mental health problems, suicide and fast-rising domestic brutality. More might die because of lockdown than from Covid- itself.The economy, meanwhile, is on le support. The UK “jobs miracle” is merely a memory. Some will leave lockdown to find their jobs gone, perhaps for ever.The Treasury’s mammoth multi-billion support scheme will leave crippling long-term economic wounds.One in four firms has stopped trading and Britain risks its worst economic slump in centuries.We are not alone. The Eurozone is fighting for its le. We may be witnessing the end of the single currency, an event which would send seismic waves around the world.THE furore over Covid- has temporarily eclipsed Brexit but the wrangle goes on.Strutting peacock Michel Barnier, used to getting his own way with Theresa May, has yet to discover the game is up. He wants Britain to give Brussels the same powers over UK trade and fishing aswe were still a vassal state.Barnier has yet to learn the shoe is on the other foot. Britain is now a sovereign trading nation.Europe is a busted flush. We leavenecessary without a deal. End of story.Russia, Nigeria and the Gulf states are being ravaged by the oil price collapse. Dirt-poor families in Africa and Asia — reliant on cash sent home by migrant children — are seeing those lelines severed overnight.In America, where Depression-style unemployment is close to million, the revolt against lockdown is already under way.Lockdown is prolonging the worldwide agony. This email from Cambridge post office manager and Sun reader Rob Swt sums up the view of many baffled Sun readers. Rob says: “We allow customers in to match the number serving and everyone has PPE.“At no point has anybody had symptoms or gone absent through coronavirus. We use our common sense then go home to our families before doing it all again the next day.“Along with supermarkets, building sites and some small shops, we have been open throughout and at no point have cases risen to the extent we have had to close down.”If lockdown continues for too long, many of those one- in-four firms which have already stopped trading will not reopen. High streets will look like a row of rotten teeth. Some school children will never catch up.On his first day back at work on Monday, the Prime Minister faces a tough challenge.An earlyto work will provoke left-wing charges that money means more than lives to the Tories.

said:Speaking today, he said: We are making progress, with fewer hospital admissions, few Covid patients in ICU, and there are real signs now we are passing through the peak.Thanks to your

the biggest single challenge this country has faced since the war, and I no way minimise the continuing problems we face.Mr Johnson has spent a fortnight recovering from coronavirus after a bout that

coronavirus lockdown restrictions.The invasive technology could be added to the UKs arsenal of tactics to track and trace cases of COVID- and ensure people are following social distancing rules.Bulgaria has become the latest country to test the wristbands during the pandemic.Up to  residents in Sofia, Bulgarias capital city, will be given a device that record their every movement using GPS satellite.Other countries are also testing similar wristbands to enforce stay at home orders.South Korea and Hong Kong have been using electronic trackers.In South Korea, people found to be violating lockdown rules can be ordered to wear a tracking band, which alerts the policepeople leave the house.The trackers were introduced as people started to leave their phones at home to avoid detection.The devices also alert the authoritiespeople try to remove it.Bulgarias trial will test out Comarch LeWristbands, developed in Poland.But the technology has sparked concern from campaign groups.Privacy International said all new measures should be temporary, necessary and proportionate.They wrote in a blog post: When the pandemic is over, such extraordinary measures should be put to an end and held to account.The news comes as Brits started to show signs of lockdown fatigue over the weekend and headed out to parks and beaches over the weekend.Lichtenstein: one in  residents will be given a band to track temperature, breathing and heart rate and send it to a lab for furth investigation. Around , residents willbe given a band later this year.India: plans to manufacture thousands of location and temperature monitoring bands for people in quarantine.Hong Kong: police can be alertedpeople wearing an electronic band leave the house while under quarantineSouth Korea: residents issued wristbandsthey break lockdown rulesThe wearable devices could help the adoption of contact tracing, which the Government has said will be its cornerstone approach to easing lockdown restrictions.The test, track and trace programme will only be useful once numbers of cases are low enough that it is feasible to aggressively follow new infections and their contacts.Contact tracing, which has been used alongside lockdowns across the world, will keep a record of any new cases and anyone who has been close to them long enough to catch coronavirus.It could enable some people to leave their homes, while only those who might have been infected being forced to self-isolate.Apple and Google are developing a privacy-focused app using Bluetooth to automate the process, which the UKs NHSX is looking at.But any app would need at least  per cent uptake from the population - and about  per cent of smartphones in the UK dont have the Bluetooth Low Energyneeded for it to work.Some researchers have suggested simple Bluetooth wristbands could be used by people who dont have a smartphone.Christophe Fraser, of the Oxford Big Data Institute, said: It would be an option to increase coverage and there are also cheaper Bluetooth devices that could have the basic ality without being a full smartphone.Wearable Bluetooth devices could indicate in a very basic way whether contact has been made.Other methods of contact tracing could be by using text alerts, which can be localised to an area where there are new cases of coronavirus.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

tests haven’t been able to get the tests they need.More than ten million essential workers and their households are now able to get checked for COVID-, as the Government races to hit their own , daily testing target by Thursday.But for people who are live remotely or are too sick to get to a drive-through centre, there is very little capacity.Health Secretary Matt Hancock has blamed lack of demand, rather than lack of capacity, on not ramping up testing faster.As of . this morning, home testing kits were unavailable on the gov.uk coronavirus website.Slots open daily at am.People are still able to book to get tested at drive-through centres in England and Scotland, but slots in Wales and Northern Ireland were listed as unavailable.To help hit Government testing targets, all health and social care workers, police officers, teachers, social workers, undertakers, journalists and supermarket and food production staff are now able to get tested.Mr Hancock said any essential worker who could benefit from a test, will be able to get a test.British Medical Association chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said there was no point setting up the online booking systemit didnt have enough capacity.He said: What we found in the first two days was that within an hour the bookings had all been taken up, and therefore offered no practical help for large numbers of healthcare staff.If the Government wants healthcare workers to have access to the test, it has to be in the context or providing adequate capacity, not a first come, first served and closing within an hour.Thats not delivering on the needs of our health and care staff.Dr Nagpaul added the testing capacity was well, well short of the number of healthcare staff currently self-isolating. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun

In his first No statement since surviving Covid-, the Tory leader promised he would say more about restrictions in the coming days. We will at some point move out of the first phase of lockdown, he said, and into a second phase of easing restrictions while massively ramping up monitoring of the disease. But despite a review of the lockdown due before May , Mr Johnson said the UK can only move past the first phase when we fulfil five tests.These tests were first outlined  days ago by Dominic Raab, the Prime Ministeraposs stand-in while he was sick. Only once the UK has fulfilled these tests will some of the lockdown measures - though not all - be relaxed. So what are the five tests, and why are they so crucial  Here is a brief explainer.   The NHS is able to cope So far, the NHS has not exceeded capacity in hospitals - with spare intensive care beds and spare ventilators. But that is only because capacity was ramped up, including in vast Nightingale field hospitals. And more importantly, because lockdown has kept the number of critically ill patients lower than it would be. Government modelling predicts how many hospital cases there will be at the virusaposs peak . If the model predicts demand will outstrip supply then we canapost ease up on restrictions. It would mean doctors and nurses were forced to make heartbreaking choices about who should be kept alive. As Dominic Raab put it: We must be confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK.   A sustained fall in deathsDominic Raab said earlier this month: We need to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from coronavirus so we are confident that we have moved beyond the peak.The peak of recorded deaths was  on April , while the peak of new positive cases was , on April . But the new positive cases could shoot up now that testing has been ramped up to include key workers and their families. And deaths are falling, but are still at more than  newly recorded each day. Each one is a human being with a devastated family. This is a huge toll of people dying each day. Before easing up on restrictions the virus has to recede and let up on its terrible toll on the public.   New infections dropping enough Mr Raab said: We need to have reliable data from SAGE showing that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board. That means focusing on the crucial aposRapos number - the number of people each person with Covid- infects on average. If R is more than ., it means the virus spreads exponentially and soon runs out of control. At the moment it is between about . and ., but only because the lockdown is restricting peopleaposs contact with each other. Any small change could push it above . And that risk is especially highnew infections arenapost dropping enough - i.e.,the aposRapos number is currently only just below .   Adequate testing and PPE Dominic Raab said: We need to be confident that the range of operational challenges, including testing capacity and PPE, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand. This is obviously about the huge issues in supplying gloves, gowns and masks that have plagued hospitals and care homes. But itaposs also about testing - and the need to get up to the governmentaposs ,-per-day target.  The reason this is so crucial is because only with a test, track and trace approach can we know early onthe virus is resurging in the community. That will allow the government to respond quickly before it gets out of control. The idea is to combine mass testing with an army of , contact-tracing staff and an NHS phone app which would use Bluetooth to tell youyouaposve been in close contact with someone oneaposs infected. This app and these staff must be up and running before the test can truly be fulfilled.

Victimsapos calls to helplines have climbed amid evidence incidents were becoming more complex and serious with higher levels of violence and coercive control, a report says. One organisation, Counting Dead Women, has calculated that between March , when the lockdown began, and April , there were at least  domestic abuse killings of women and children. Labour MP and committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper said: Staying at home is an important part of the strategy to prevent coronavirus from spreading and save lives, but for some people home isnapost safe.Urgent action is needed to protect victims and prevent perpetrators from exploiting the lockdown to increase abuse.

The Prime Minister is mulling when and how to relax some restrictions as he resumes work at full health in  Downing Street this morning. Allies of Mr Johnson - who survived a trip to intensive care with coronavirus - told the Dailyhe could go sooner than the lockdown review deadline of May . “There is definitely a sense that we could be doing more than we are at the moment in terms of people being to work, especiallythey are working outdoors, one said. The PM faces a Cabinet split over the timetable, other European countries moving to ease up, and pressure from Tory backbenchers - whose rep Sir Graham Brady branded restrictions illogical. But junior Health Minister Edward Argar - who was chosen to comment on the governmentaposs plans by No - today warned weaposre not out of the woods yet. With  new deaths being announced yesterday alone, Mr Argar said it is too early to speculate on lting the lockdown and now is not the time to ease up. Asked about the Daily aposs reporting, he did not deny it directly but told BBC Breakfast: I’ve learned not to always believe everything I read in a newspaper or beyond.  Mr Argar said Boris Johnson is back to full health and back at the helm today, chairing the daily .am Covid- meeting of ministers. The Health Minister added to Sky News: He will be back in the driving seat as we speak, getting on with the job. He is raring to be back and he is full of energy. But on easing the lockdown he added: I’ve seen a lot of the speculation in the papers and beyond in recent days. But the reality is we’re not there yet.  We’re not in a place where the science says it is safe to ease the restrictions. So we need to keep these in place to keep that infection under control and not lose the gains from all the sacrices we’ve made. The lockdown must legally be reviewed by May  - which is  days ago - and Mr Argar did not deny it could be changed then. But evenit eased at that point, it will not be lted in one go. Instead, the UK is expected to mount a phasedto a new normal rather than going back to how things were before. This could mean schools and some shops reopening while pubs, restaurants and mass gatherings remain shut.  A source told the Daily : May  is the day when the Government is legally obliged to review the lockdown measures butBoris wants to change the restrictions earlier than that, or at least announce something before that, then he could go sooner. The Daily Mail also reported today that ministers will be moving on from the aposStay at homeapos message to other measures. However, Mr Argar told LBC: We are sticking very firmly with the current message which is stay home, protect the NHS and save lives.  Tory MPs fear the economy will collapsesome restrictions are not eased. Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the  committee of Tory backbenchers, told the BBCaposs Westminster Hour: I think there is a recognition that we need to do much more to get the economy moving. There is a limit to how long people will tolerate those things, especiallysome of the aspects of the restrictions seem illogical. For instance at my local market, the flower stall was told it couldn’t trade, but in a supermarket of course they can sell flowers, because they’re selling foods as well. So ironing out some of those slightly silly anomalies I think would actually help to bring people along with some continuation of restrictions. Mr Argar said I totally get the frustrations but said: Really we do need to stick with this. He told Sky News: At the moment we’re simply not in a position to be able to make changes to that.

The clutch of ex-premiers set aside political dferences to throw their weight behind our drive to honour the brave healthcare workers battling on the Covid- frontline. The quintet – two Labour and three Tory – ruled Britain for  years. Now, they are calling for the incredible bravery, courage and sacrice of the men and women at the sharp end of the UKaposs fight against the disease to be recognised when the crisis has eased. Supporting the Mirroraposs drive, Conservative Sir John Major, , who was in power from - and introduced the NHS Patientaposs Charter to boost care, said: The frontline of NHS and care home staff are genuinely risking their lives on a day-to-day basis to care for patients who are very sick. The strain is no doubt felt by their families too, who must be deeply fearful of the risks their loved ones are taking as they help others. This is no ordinary commitment, and needs to be acknowledged. The campaign to award a medal to appropriate workers deserves universal support but, after that, comes a greater task: it is time to reassess the value of key services and key workers, and ensure that never again must they face such risks so unprepared. Labour former premier Tony Blair, , who pumped record amounts of cash into the NHS during his decade in Downing Street from -, said: “I wholeheartedly support the Mirror’s campaign to recognise the selfless and heroic public servants in our health service who are on the frontline against this terrible virus. “Every day we hear their incredible inidual stories, their personal and professional efforts to do everything they can to care for those suffering and keep us all safe.   “And we should not forget that they too are coping with losses amongst colleagues and friends. “The country can never thank them enough and we will be forever indebted to them.” Labouraposs Gordon Brown, , who was Mr Blairaposs Chancellor for  years and PM from -, said: “When in government, we created an Armed Services medal to thank all who had served our Armed Forces. Now, our nurses, doctors and NHS workers are today risking their lives to save so many lives and serving their country, just like those who served our country so bravely during war.  In every community of our country there should be the chance, through a medal, to honour brave servants of our country.  Tory David Cameron, , who was PM from - and once said his priority could be “summed up in three letters – NHS”, introduced the Ebola Medal in  for Britons, including civilians, helping the response to the disease in West Africa. Supporting our drive for a similar medal for those fighting coronavirus, he said: “The Ebola medals were a huge success and richly deserved. “I am sure the Government might rightly be thinking about measures similar to this to recognise and pay tribute to the outstanding and selfless work being carried out by so many throughout this current emergency.”  The most recent former premier, Conservative Theresa May, honoured the doctor who treated her Type  diabetes after she stepped down from No last summer after three years in power. Supporting the Mirroraposs call for a Covid- medal for NHS staff, Mrs May, , said: “Day in, day out, throughout this crisis our NHS workers and volunteers selflessly put themselves on the line to help others in their fight against coronavirus. “Very often this means sacricing time with their own families so they can help save ours.  “They are, as many have said, the very best of us and it is right that we find a way to honour them and say thank you on behalf of us all.”  No has signalled its support for our campaign, fuelling hopes that once the outbreak is over thoughts can turn to how best to recognise the efforts of those involved. Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman said last month: “The Prime Minister is very clear about the debt of gratitude which we all owe to the NHS workforce. “They are doing a fantastic job and I am sure the nation will want to find a way to say thank you once we have defeated this virus.” That was before the PM was taken to hospital suffering with coronavirus.  He spent three nights in intensive care at St Thomasapos Hospital, London, and later praised the personal courage of NHS staff who he said saved his le when it could have gone either way”.  They kept putting themselves in harmaposs way, kept risking this deadly virus, he said in a Twitter video after being discharged. It is thanks to that courage, that devotion, that duty and that love that our NHS has been unbeatable,” Mr Johnson added. Asked earlier this month about the Mirroraposs campaign to give NHS workers a medal, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said at the No daily press conference: “The job they are doing is amazing, inspirational, we have all talked about it from these podiums. “Of course they deserve all the tributes and all the recognition and I am sure we will want to look very carefully at how we do that once we have got the other side of this crisis.” "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus building sites lockdown open","story":"NewsCoronavirus: Building sites on lockdown to open on evenings and weekendsMinisters are reportedly set to give construction sites shutdown by coronavirus the green light to operate outside their council set hours in an effort to avoid a repeat of the aftermath of the  financial crash when smaller building firms were left flounderingShareCommentsByRyan Merrield:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video dominic-raab-coronavirus-vaccine-not-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-building-sites-lockdown-open-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

A government source has told The Sundayministers are set to allow firms to override off-peak noise laws to help them get on top of halted work. It comes after a report allegedly told ministers the first stages of re-opening the economy should look at sectors with the greatest multiplier effects with minimum risks.Coffee shops and restaurants were initially earmarked due to their potential for supporting agriculture, while the property market was another sector with a wide impact. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.    Construction sites had largely closed down on March  along with the rest of the country after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a lockdown to help curb the spread of the deadly virus.The source claimed this is in the hope of avoiding repeating the  financial crash, which saw small building firms struck hard and many never recovered. Whataposs more, concern is growing among sub-contractors that their work agreements may be quashed due to common clauses thatwork is stopped for two months a contract can be legally nulled.

The Dailyreports the Health Consultants and Specialists Associationhas put pressure on Public Health England to change its guidance, which says such lesaving measures can be performed with lower grade protection. It comes as a survey found one in four GPs has seen Covid- patients face to face without adequate protective equipment. The latest guidance from leading authority the Resuscitation Council UK considers CPR an aerosol-generating procedurewhere a patient is exhaling infectious droplets - meaning medics need the top grade of PPE. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  However, Public Health England does not categorise CPR as highly, with the HCSA concerned this may be being dictated by the mass shortages of equipment currently available to NHS staff. Union president Dr Claudia Paoloni told the : “If you have a doctor who has their own comorbidity, say they have asthma, they now have to make a decision ‘do I put myself in additional risk by doing this’. It is a really awful ethical dilemma.” Public Health England said its guidance was dictated by a review undertaken by the Governmentaposs New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group .  Dr Nick Phin, Covid- incident director at PHE, said: “The safety of those working on the front line in health and social care is our number one priority. He added that chest compressions would not be added to the authorityaposs list of AGP.  CPR in hospitals, however, sees ventilators take the place of mouth-to-mouth unlike what is taught to first aiders in the general public. More than halfof doctors in general practice reported feeling unsafe at work due to a lack of personal protective equipment , while only a thirdsaid they had received an adequate supply of face masks. The Government has come under mounting criticism over its ability to ensure frontline staff treating coronavirus patients have the protection they need.More than  NHS workers are now confirmed to have died during the pandemic. A survey of  GPs by Pulse magazine, the publication for GPs, found that around one in fourrespondents reported seeing patients with Covid- while not wearing any protective equipment. GPs reported dficulty accessing PPE, with only % saying they have received adequate eye protectors, while % said they have been provided with gowns. Three-quartersof GPs said they fear for their health and or le. Meanwhile, % of respondents to the survey, carried out between April  and , said they are adopting a no PPE, no see policy at work. The magazine said a number of GPs had reported seeing asymptomatic patients who were later found to be Covid- positive. One in five reported that they had the disease - either confirmed or suspected - and more than a quarter said they have self-isolated, increasing pressure on the workforce.

The pangolin, a scaly mammal that looks like an anteater, is believed to be a factor in the leap of the coronavirus from animals to humans at a market in Wuhan, China, last year after one was infected by a bat. This notoriety could actually now turn out to be a blessing in disguise. There are eight species, four in Africa and four in Asia – all at risk of extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Of the Asian species, two are critically endangered. They are illegally hunted and traded for their meat, which is considered a delicacy in some south-east Asian countries such as China and Vietnam. Their scales are used in traditional medicine despite there being no scientic proof of their ­therapeutic value. As a result, these shy, nocturnal mammals, covered in hard protective scales made of keratin – the same material as our nails – are now the world’s most trafficked animal. Back in , the international trade in pangolins was entirely banned by the  nations which have signed up to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. But despite all species being given the strictest protection possible, the illegal trade continued, often with shipments of scales shipped out to Asia via Nigeria – the largest trade hub in Africa. An investigation into trafficking found the West African country was linked to % of pangolin scales seized globally between  and . Just last month, Malaysian port authorities seized six tons of pangolin scales hidden inside a container of cashew nuts and smashed a smuggling syndicate.  Another bust last year saw scales worth millionon the black market seized in Singapore. While pangolins and other bushmeats like bats were on sale in markets in Libreville in Gabon last month, sales quickly dropped as news of the pandemic spread.

The High Pay Centre think-tank found that % of FTSE  ­firms have reduced boardroom pay. Yet just % have committed to cutting bonuses. It comes as Virgin Atlantic denied that the Government had rejected its plea for a £million bailout and that a buyer is now being sought for the airline. Boss Sir Richard Branson has defended the call for state help, despite sitting on an estimated £.billion fortune and with his Virgin empire registered in the tax haven of the British Virgin Islands. Virgin Atlantic is also using taxpayers’ cash to cover % of the wages of , furloughed staff. Another taking advantage of the Government’s wages scheme is tycoon Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia empire – whose chains include Topman, Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge – for , staff. Fashion designer Victoria Beckham has furloughed staff despite her and husband David having a reputed £m fortune. The High Pay Centre analysed the FTSE  index of the UK’s biggest listed ­companies. The index does not include Virgin Atlantic or Arcadia. It showed at least  are using the Government’s Job Retention Scheme through the crisis. Over the past five years, those firms have handed out a combined £m in pay to their chief executives, £bn in idends, plus made £bn in profits. The list includes fashion giant Next, the owner of Primark – Associated British Foods – and Barratt Developments, the country’s biggest house builder.  According to the report, the  firms paid chief executives an average of £.m a year in pay, bonuses and perks between  and . In response to the crisis, a third of the FTSE  have scrapped or sus­­pended ­idends. And ex­­ecutives who have agreed to a cut have typically had salaries tem­­p­­orary reduced by between a fth and a third. Yet the High Pay Centre points out the average FTSE  chief executive is on £, a year. Many workers who are being furloughed will struggle as their wages fall by %. Some of the  firms have said they will top up salaries.  They include British Gas’ parent company Centrica and Premier Inn owner Whitbread. The Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated the cost of the Job Retention Scheme at £bn. Luke Hildyard, director of the High Pay Centre, said: “The scheme is a vital progressive measure to protect people’s jobs and incomes but it’s important to understand it is a subsidy for businesses, as well as for workers. “The companies will be under particular pressure to achieve a fairer balance between rewards for executives, investors and their wider workforce in future.”  Associated British Foods is only furloughing staff in Primark. A spokesman said: “Salaries for the executive directors have been cut by half at their request.” Next said: “With stores statutorily closed, companies like Next would have little ­alternative but to make very large numbers redundant. The ­Government provided this cash exactly so this doesn’t happen.” Next said directors have not been paid bonuses earned last year, will not get one this year, and have taken a temporary % pay cut, with idends unlikely to be paid during the crisis.

Trudi Stonard,  from Walsall, West Midlands, was “lucky to survive” after she was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, a condition which causes inflammation of the colon and rectum. In just  weeks, her condition escalated to “le-threatening” and surgeons spent six hours removing her bowel which was so inflamed it was like “it was on fire”. The mum-of-two started experiencing extreme stomach pain in December . She was even in agony when she ate a packet of crisps.She was misdiagnosed with irritable bowel syndromebut Trudi feared it was more serious when she started passing blood after eating “one bite of KFC”.Trudi dropped from st lb to st lb and her son Leonard, now seven, refused to go near her because she looked “unrecognisable”. She underwent surgery to remove her part of her colon and replace it with a stoma bag at New Cross Hospital, Wolverhampton, in February . Despite the damage to her insides, Trudi managed to “miraculously” fall pregnant with her son Bobby-Jo, now four, and has learnt to embrace her stoma. Trudi said: “In the space of  weeks I went from a normal person, to someone with a stoma bag. “The surgeon met me after my surgery and said he’d never seen a colon that bad. “In fact, it look so inflamed, it he said it looked like it was on ‘fire’. “He said: ‘I just wanted to stamp on it and put it out.’ While I was suffering from colitis, I lost around five stone. I lost so much weight people thought I was anorexic.  Itaposs been a dficult adjustment but Iaposve learnt to love my stoma bag. If someone offered to reverse it tomorrow Iaposd so no - itaposs part of who I am now. In December , Trudi started getting stomach pain and going to the loo more frequently. Things escalated in a matter of weeks until everything she ate was leaving her in agony and was rapidly losing weight. Trudi was diagnosed with IBS but she knew suspected it was more serious after she tucked into a takeaway. After ‘one bite’ she rushed to the toilet where she saw blood ‘flowingapos from her behind. Trudi said: “I never had any problems with my stomach until February. “Anything I ate, from a small snack to a meal, was leaving me in agony. Even a packet of crisps caused this crushing pain that felt like I was going to be sick.  “I went to my GP but said it was just IBS and gave me buscopan but nothing helped. “One night I tried to eat some KFC, I had one bite of chicken and I had to dash to the toilet where I saw blood literally flowing from my behind. Trudi went to New Cross Hospital, Wolverhampton, West Midlands, where doctors suspected she had food poisoning and sent home. Two days later she collapsed and her mum Jill Stonard, , rushed her to AE while she was ‘screaming’ in pain. Trudi said: When doctors said it was food poisoning and I thought: ‘That makes sense.’ “I thought that would explain why my stomach had been so bad. But when my mum found me screaming in pain, she took me straight back to hospital. Trudi continued to lose weight and was going to the loo over  times a day. In the space of  weeks she gone from st lb to st lb. She said: I kept losing weight and couldnapost keep anything down. One day I went to the loo around  times in one day.  The doctors tried to take a stool sample but the bed pan looked like someone had poured a pint of blood in it. “I felt awful and was barely able to get out of bed. My brought my little boy up to visit but he wouldnapost go anywhere near me. “He said: ‘You’re not my mummy’. That was devastating. Trudi was sent for more tests over two weeks including a colposcopy – which involved sending a camera through her colon. She said doctors found the lining of bowel ‘covered in ulcers’ and she was finally diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. Doctors tried every medication but nothing was working. In February , Trudiaposs last resort was to undergo surgery called a colostomy.  It involved removing the affected bowel and erting the end through opening in the tummy called a aposstomaapos. The stoma would then be fitted with a stoma bag to collect the waste. She said: “When they did the colposcopy they said my bowel was literally covered in ulcers. We tried every medication and steroid but I was throwing it all up. In the end, it was an operation or Iaposd lose my le. Surgery should only take a couple of hours but my bowel was so bad, it took them six hours. Trudi was told it would be dficult to conceive because of the damage to her insides. She was shocked to discover she had fallen pregnant three months after her op in June . Despite the odds against her, Trudi continued with her pregnancy and found out it was a little boy. “He was a total surprise – I was told it would be impossible to have a baby with condition,apos she said. Things started well but once the bump appeared, it put a lot of pressure of my stoma. I was told that I wouldnapost carry to full term but Bobby-Jo was a little fighter. The real problem was going into labour. I hadnapost been to the loo for ages, Iaposd forgotten how to push! Giving birth was the hardest thing in the world – luckily, he arrived safe and sound.

It will be a cooler, more unsettled week for much of the UK as temperaturesto average for this time of year, with some downpours expected, according to the Met Office. Warm conditions during the UKaposs fth weekend in lockdown due to coronavirus prompted concern that members of the public could defy restrictions on movement.Forecaster Craig Snell said across Wales, the Midlands and over towards Yorkshire on Monday, it is expected to be cloudy with outbreaks of rain. Northern England, Northern Ireland and Scotland will see a bright day with a scattering of showers, while south of the M corridor could experience the odd shower. In that southern zone, weaposre going to hang on to the warmer air for one more day, so we could see C around the London area tomorrow, he said. The rest of the UK will see cooler spells, especially in the Midlands, where temperatures could dip to C or C - a signicant drop to highs of .C recorded at Holbeach in Lincolnshire on Sunday. It will be slightly warmer in the North, with temperatures between C and C. On Tuesday, a spell of persistent rain is expected to move across parts of England and Wales, while bright spells and scattered showers continue in Northern Ireland and Scotland.  Another band of rain will push north-eastwards on Wednesday, according to the Met Office. Thursday will see scattered showers - some heavy and thundery - across many parts of the UK. So on the final day of April, we will actually have a day of April showers across many parts of the UK, Mr Snell said. A much more dferent picture from this week where places have just seen blue skies and sunshine. Next week, there will be a lot more cloud in the sky and for many of us we will see some rain at some point.

With our backs to the walls, the Few – the Spitfire and Hurricane pilots of the RAF – then kept the mighty Luftwaffe at bay, Blitz spirit kept us going through the dark days of enemy bombing and, although we stood alone, David held back Goliath until the Americans finally joined in with their enormous material might. It was all a bit amateurish and Captain Mainwaring, but we stuck it out to the bitter end, although we’ve been paying for it pretty much ever since. Lend lease repayments finished only during Gordon Brown’s time as Prime Minister. It might surprise a few to know that almost every bit of what is written above is wrong. Rather, we British played a far more dominant and skilful role in the war than we often give ourselves credit and with a pragmatic ruthlessness that is rarely appreciated. Anniversaries are useful because they give us time to pause and reflect, and in this th anniversary year it’s no bad thing to look afresh at Britain’s really very impressive part in the eventual victories of . For the next three days, we are going to be offering a brief outline of Britain’s war, and today will be looking at the opening year up to the end of the Battle of Britain. It’s worth pointing out that no matter how diminished we might have become since, on September , , when PM Neville Chamberlain announced war with Germany, Britain was the biggest global superpower. We had the largest empire the world has ever known, and even greater extra-imperial assets. Britain owned huge stakes in Argentina, for example, with many farms, ports and railways run by British firms. London was also the centre of the greatest global trading network ever witnessed. We had the world’s largest navy, largest merchant navy – some , ships – and access to around % of the world’s merchant fleet. These were huge assets. Germany had almost no merchant marine, a very small navy and was virtually land-locked within Europe because the moment war was declared, the Royal Navy imposed a very tight naval blockade.The shortage of supplies, and especially food and oil, dominated Germany’s war strategy from the outset. Britain had a small army because we had a very large navy and rapidly growing RAF, and because its ally France had a massive army that was better equipped than any other in the world, including that of Germany. The trouble was, France was politically fractured with a coalition government of many parties and was unable to ever agree anything themselves, let alone much with their British ally. The lack of political direction had, in turn, a deep effect on the military leadership. So, it was not until April  that Britain and France finally agreed to mine the shipping routes in northern Norway to stop Swedish iron ore reaching Germany.  By that time, Germany had decided to invade Norway and Denmark and did so with clinical efficiency. After all, their lines of supply were much shorter and most of Britain’s army was in France awaiting a German attack there. Denmark was conquered in a day. Norway took until June, but although the British and small French contingency were beaten on land, the Royal Navy hammered the German Kriegsmarine, whose surface fleet was half destroyed and which never recovered. Then, on May , the Germans attacked in the west, pouring into France and the Low Countries with two massive thrusts.That same day, Winston Churchill became Prime Minister after Chamberlain resigned over Norway, so Britain was politically in crisis at the very moment the biggest clash of the war to date was beginning. Britain had sent  isions to France, compared with  French and  Belgian, so their contribution was very small. Nonetheless, Britain had the world’s first fully mechanised army.  In contrast, of the  isions the Germans used, only  were mechanised. The other  used what armies always had – horses and their soldiers’ own two feet. Only % of the German Army was fully trained. But those  German mechanised isions did for the French. France had plenty of tanks, guns and soldiers, but very few radios and, with telephone lines cut and refugees clogging roads, its commanders struggled to communicate with one another. But the Germans had plenty of radios and their infantry, artillery and tanks were able to co-ordinate attacks, while above, the Luftwaffe marauded freely because the French had no air defence system. This meant the Germans were able to pick off the superior numbers of French in penny packets.And when the French and Belgians started to fall back, the British Expeditionary Force had to do the same and ended up at Dunkirk.  When they had fought, the British had fought very well and effectively. Their counter-attack at Arras on May , , gave the Germans a real scare. It was the Royal Navy and the RAF – along with the superb defence of the Dunkirk perimeter – that ensured the bulk of the British Army got back home. Little Ships accounted for perhaps % of those lted and most were taken not from the beaches but from the East Mole – a wooden pier that extended from the harbour and which was untouched by bombs. The RAF of Fighter Command shot down large numbers of Stuka e-bombers and so it could be argued that the Battle of Britain began then. At any rate, once France fell in the third week of June , Britain was far from alone. The Dominions and Empire backed Britain, while the world’s resources were readily accessible. Although U-boats started making a menace of themselves, there were never more than  operating at one time in the Atlantic – and that was not enough to bring Britain to her knees.  We also had the world’s first fully co-ordinated air defence system, the entire Home Fleet ready and waiting to intercept any invasion attempt, and also “Harry Tate’s Navy” – the Royal Navy Patrol Service – which were fishing boats and crews converted to minelayers and sweepers, armed and also acting as an anti-invasion watch. There was also the Home Guard – more than two million strong by August , and not all Dad’s Army by any means. Nor was Britain defended only by the Few in Fighter Command. Coastal and Bomber Commands were attacking enemy targets every day, including four raids on Berlin before the first deliberate Luftwaffe raid on London on September . Aircraft production was more than double that of Germany in , intelligence was vastly superior and the Luftwaffe were hammered in the battle. The Spitfires and Hurricanes were not the last line of defence, but the first, and nor were they always outnumbered. On Sunday, September , , what became known as Battle of Britain Day,  enemy aircraft attacked London in the largest raid of the day, but were attacked in turn by  Spitfires and Hurricanes. Germany had planned to fight a short, sharp war, but failure to defeat Britain in  meant it needed resources from where, and realistically, they could only come from the Soviet Union.

He then lowers his feet and stands on the hapless turtle while trying to ride it like a hoverboard. The abused turtle appears to be in distress as it uses its flippers to support itself against a nearby rock. Marco Weizhong, who recorded the video on a GoPro underwater camera, can be seen trying to get the attention of the snorkeller to stop him from hurting the turtle. Marco then swims over and shouts at the tourist while telling him to stop. The ocean lover said he was shocked to have witnessed the incident and reported it to the Taiwanaposs Tourism Bureau for investigation. He said: I will not stand by and watch this disgusting behaviour. We all need to respect wildle and protect the environment. Marco said the tour guide guided his group towards the turtles. He added: Not only did tourists touch the turtles, but they even stepped on it with their feet. As an ocean lover, I really cannot bare to see this kind of behaviour. I sent a report letter to the government, but I received a notice saying that because it is not an offence actively happening, it will be dficult for them to punish them retrospectively. Therefore, I want to try and stop this behaviour through the power of public opinion and call on the public to respect wildle and protect the ecological environment.

The disaster is directly responsible for  people but many hundreds,not thousands, more became seriously ill and lost their lives in the aftermath. The explosion was caused by what should have been a routine test - but its impact was immediate and the aftermath has stretched over the following decades. The  disaster saw huge plumes of radiative smoke threaten to cover the whole of Europe and beyond. The impact of those coming into direct contact with the radiation was instant and horric. People living in Pripyat were initially kept in the dark about what had happened - but when they started falling ill with severe headaches, vomiting and uncontrollable fits of coughing, the authorities finally took action. A day after the explosion the first buses arrived to get people to safety. Lives are still being lost due to the devastating effects of that day on April , . Dozens of heroic men and women sacriced their own lives in a desperate bid to make the ruin reactor safe and put out the flames following the explosion. Tonne up tonne of sand was dumped on the structure and courageous staff worked around the clock to make the site as safe as possible. Coal miners were drafted in from across the Soviet Union to dig under the reactoraposs core to creat a huge pool of liquid nitrogen to cool the nuclear fuel within. Finally, when the fires were out of the radiative contained as well as it could be, a huge concrete structure was built over the site. It took  days to build the first sarcophagus, using , cubic metres of concrete and , tonnes of metal framework. Yaroslav Melnik, the leader of a group of firefighters brought in from the town of Ivano Frankivsk, remembered: “We worked in three shts, but only for five to seven minutes at a time because of the danger. “After finishing, weaposd throw our clothes in the garbage.” Later named the aposliquidatorsapos, thousands of these men and women are reported to have died during their work, or suffered long-term illnesses from acute radiation exposure. It had been hoped it would contain the deadly radiation leaking from the nuclear plant - but dangerous levels were still escaping every day. And this huge structure was only designed to be temporary -  years after the explosion, things had become critical once again. Now, after the best minds in the world came up with a solution a huge steel sarcophagus covers the ruined reactor, which itaposs hoped will keep it safe for decades to come. However, the surrounding area is still unihabitable, with those who had called Pripyat their home before the disaster now relocated. It was  hours after the disaster before the evacuation started and many of those who were livng in Pripyat have suffered devastating consequences. Whataposs left behind is an eerie and abandoned ghost town with chilling reminders of the ordinary, family le that once existed there the only things left behind. TVs stand unwatched, cots lie empty and kitchens and living rooms that were once filled with love and laughter are now silent and have been reclaimed by nature. Classrooms where pupils used to sit at the rows of desks are covered in cobweb and dust as sunlight streams in through the broken windows. Pripyat had been a busy and bustling town, built in the shadow of the Chernobyl nuclear power station. With work for thousands of people it was prosperous and fairgrounds, shopping malls, restaurants and bars all sprung up to provide those living there with entertainment. These now lie abandoned with trees, vines and creepers sprawling across rollercoasters. Apartment blocks are now scarred by the weather after remaining unlived in for the last  years. Photojournalist and tourist guide Anton Petrus has visited Pripyat several times in recent years. He said: Pripyat is the worst place Iaposve ever been. I first visited five years ago and the first thing I thought was aposthis place looks like our planet after humanity disappearsapos. Hospital are especially haunting in the town which was once home to , people.

Boris Johnson today s to Downing Street and faces pressure to outline how the UK might exit lockdown. And he could turn to the situation in Rome for inspiration. We expect a very complex challenge, Conte said as he outlined the road map to restarting activities put into hibernation since early March. We will live with the virus and we will have to adopt every precaution possible. Manufacturers, construction companies and some wholesalers will be allowed to reopen from May , followed by retailers two weeks later.  Restaurants and bars will be allowed to reopen fully from the beginning of June, although takeaway business will be possible earlier.

The report in Rodong Sinmun comes amid wild speculation over the health of the North Korean leader, who is said to have undergone heart surgery on April . State media reported that Kim had thanked workers on the project in the city of Wonsan, where a train believed to be his has been spotted in satellite images amid unveried reports that he is either dead, in a vegetative state or alive and well. Kimaposs whereabouts and the status of his health remain a mystery as he has not been seen in state media reports since April , the day before he reportedly had the operation. The only thing that is certain is no-one knows for sure what is happening inside North Korea. Any claims about Kim or the countryaposs activities are almost impossible to very given Pyongyangaposs secrecy and isolation from the rest of the world. Kim has previously been pictured touring the Wonsan-Kalma construction project, which was supposed to finish in April .  Speculation erupted after Kim missed an annual birthday celebration for his late grandfather - Kim Il-sung, the countryaposs founder - on April . It was held three days after Kim Jong-un is reported to have undergone heart surgery. A unnamed source in China told JoongAng Ilbo, a newspaper in South Korea, that Kim was forced to skip the event because one of his bodyguards was suspected to have contracted Covid-.  It would have put Kim, those close to him and his other bodyguards in danger of catching the potentially deadly virus, and it also would have put a restriction on his public appearances, the report added. Another South Korean newspaper, Dong-A Ilbo, quoted an unnamed US official as saying Kim left Pyongyang for a resort compound in the seaside city of Wonsan to avoid the virus. The official claimed some of Kimaposs aides and high-ranking officials had contracted Covid-. He was seen walking on his own between April  and , the official added.  Throughout the pandemic, North Korea has insisted it hasnapost had any cases of coronavirus, a claim that has been rejected by the international community. State media last reported on Kimaposs whereabouts when he oversaw a Politburo meeting on April . A photo of him at the meeting was published the following day and he hasnapost been seen since. While Kim was out of public view, a source inside North Korea told Seoul-based website Daily NK, which is run by defectors, that the leader had undergone heart surgery at a hospital reserved exclusively for his family on April .

Branding those who have been panic-buying supplies such as toilet paper absolutely ridiculous, he continued: That is the sort of person that is causing the problem in the whole country. Speaking to News, he said the man wanted to get rid of the items because he was no longer able to sell them on eBay after his site was shut down. He claimed that he had as many as  people working with him to buy up the highly-sought after commodities. Australiaaposs Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton, has said that the government will come down like a ton of bricks on supermarket hoarders who have been clearing shelves of basic supplies.

Some officials or sources now claim the dictator is dead, others say he is in a vegetative state or coma, but on Sunday it was said that he is alive and well.  The only thing that is certain is no-one knows for sure what is happening inside North Korea.And similar mystery enshrouds Kimaposs family should one of his children be called upon to succeed their father. His we Ri Sol-Ju is widely reported to have had three children since they married in  - with the first born understood to be a boy born the following year.  The childaposs name is unknown, while a possible sister, likely born in , is equally guarded and the gender of the coupleaposs final reported child, reportedly born in February , is entirely unknown. Former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed Kim once told him during a summit in Singapore he did not want his children to carry the nuclear weapon on their back their whole le. The leader has otherwise refrained from discussing his offspring in public.  Former NBA star Dennis Rodman toldhe had held Kimaposs daughter during a visit to the country in , claiming her name is Ju Ae. The assumed birth dates of the second two children have been largely built around Riaposs disappearances from public le for much of , as well as previously in .  Kimaposs sister Kim Yo Jong was promoted to the head of the propaganda department of the Workeraposs Party of Korea in October , with some suggestion she could succeed her brother should he die.  However, any claims about Kim or the countryaposs activities are almost impossible to very given Pyongyangaposs secrecy and isolation from the rest of the world.

We felt very hard done by.“The boys who were kept on were feeling really fortunate because they were still getting paid.“I don’t knowit was the plan from the bosses to pick a team that could compete but we ended up with a really good team with some good youngsters left behind.“There was real quality and we said ‘let’s have a go’.”Despite being left with a threadbare squad, former club skipper Smith had some real talent to choose from that season with a good mix of youth and experience.The older heads included former Scotland internationals Rab Douglas and Neil McCann as well as experienced campaigners like Rhys Weston and Matt Lockwood while the younger ones included future Scotland star Leigh Grfiths, Dens hero Gary Harkins and defender Craig Forsyth among others.Called up from the youth team was also striker McIntosh, who hit a purple patch of goals at a critical point in the season – an equaliser against Stirling Albion followed by a double at Morton # before the Dark Blues went north to Dingwall.The match that clinched their unlikely survival turned out to be his final one of the season, however.McIntosh said: “When the match started I actually felt my hamstring go because of the demand of all the games before Ross County.“I think I actually tore the muscle and it was only about  minutes in. I knew the gaffer could tell something was wrong but, being young and naïve, I played through it.“It got worse and worse but it got to the point where I forgot all about it and then got the goal after half-time.“I was always motivated to chase down long balls and this time the goalkeeper took his time.“I nicked it from him and I don’t think I even considered anything about what to do next, it was natural. It was a great feeling despite the pain in my hamstring.“It was a really nice day up there I remember and the supporters were there in their numbers, it was an electric atmosphere.“I scored right in front of them and it was like an explosion.“There won’t be any other games with that kind of circumstance I don’t think, it was unique.“I remember the celebrations on the pitch – it was like we’d won the league. Everyone was ecstatic and it was just pure relief.“I don’t think I realised at the time how signicant it was. My focus was only on playing well and trying to make it as a first-team player.“It was a massive game looking back.“I still get Dundee fans coming up to me in the street to say they were there.”On the game itself, McIntosh’s then team-mate Irvine admits it was all a bit of a blur looking back.He added: “I remember Leighton’s goal, he was one of the really good young boys who did just as much as the older experienced lads.“It was the only goal of the game and, at the end, it felt like we had won the league. The feeling and the celebrations afterwards for what we achieved were amazing.“I’ve always said nothing comes close to that season. I’ve won three league titles and won Challenge Cups where you get a medal at the end for your hard work – there was no medal at the end of that one but I still class saving Dundee and keeping them in the league as my best achievement.”Irvine went on to spend six years at Dens Park as a player before ing as a coach where he took the U  side before the coronavirus shutdown.McIntosh, meanwhile, has had spells at Montrose, Peterhead, Icelandic side UMF Selfoss, Arbroath and Airdrie before signing for National League side Wrexham.Following the departure of manager Bryan Hughes, the now--year-old joined Lee Clark’s Blyth Spartans on loan until the pandemic hit.Despite his contract in Wales running down this summer, McIntosh is sanguine about his future.He added: “I took the opportunity to go down south and I’ve enjoyed it. It’s very competitive and the full-time setup was a big plus for me, too.“Everything is up in the air right now and I’ll have to wait and see what pre-season brings, whenever it starts.“I am out of contract this summer but I understand the furlough scheme will cover out-of-contract players for a time so I’m not overly concerned.“It is what it is, everyone is in the same boat.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

I wasn’t there at the time but nobody really remembers the Roma European Cup semi-final too fondly but they’ll always recall Barcelona and Monchengladbach.“Getting into the final was a massive thing for the city and the club but at the time, as players, nothing was really a surprise for us.“We were expecting to get there so when we did it was great to do, don’t get me wrong, but it wasn’t as much of a surprise to us as it was outsiders.“At that time there was the European Cup, Cup Winners’ Cup and the other teams went into the Uefa Cup.“When you think about that in recent terms, Liverpool didn’t win the league last season but they won the Champions League.“That was the sort of level we were up against. It was a huge achievement.”Bowman recalls United going into the second leg riled up after witnessing some premature celebrations from the Monchengladbach players after a stalemate in Dundee.The -year-old also remembers a rare occasion where legendary boss Jim McLean inidually congratulated his players after the final whistle.Bowman, who made  appearances in tangerine, added: “Under wee Jim we were always taught, unless it was the second leg and you had to win at home, as long as you didn’t lose a goal it was OK.“That was the biggest thing, from our point of view, we didn’t get beat and we weren’t up against it.“I remember they were celebrating after the first leg and that probably gave us a bit of impetus to go on and beat them.“They were high-fiving each other because they got a - and thought the tie was over so that annoyed us a bit.“It made such a dference for us going there at - and Iain getting the goal just before half time.“They had to really come at us because they needed to score two.“Going into half time it was a massive advantage but I can’t really remember us being under that much pressure.“We knew they had to score two which was a tough ask against our defence. It was quite comfortable.“They didn’t have a lot of chances. Big Thommohad some great games and made some big saves that season but I can’t really remember him having to be brilliant.“Heggiesaid to me after it, ‘You should take this all in,’ and I was probably very naïve and just thought this happens every year, we’ll do it again next year.“I probably didn’t appreciate it as much as what I probably should have. It’s only when you look back.“It’s probably one of the only times I can recall Jim coming round and shaking everybody’s hand in the dressing-room after the game.“He really pushed us to our limits and got the best out of everybody. If he could see you had something he would get it out of you, how he did it was irrelevant.“He was very guarded towards us but he went round and congratulated everyone inidually.”United went on to lose the final - over two legs against IFK Gothenburg, with a - Scottish Cup Final defeat to St Mirren sandwiched in between.Bowman believes had they beaten the Buddies they might’ve gone on to secure the Uefa Cup, too.He continued: “It shows how much the SFA helped us at the time! We played the Scottish Cup Final on the Saturday and the second leg of the Uefa Cup Final on the Wednesday.“It was for the good of Scottish football we were trying to win it as well. I thinkwe’d beaten St Mirren, we would’ve had a lot better chance.“There’s no way of saying we’d have definitely beat Gothenburg because they were a decent team but the St Mirren loss was the first down we’d had that season.“Everything was on the up all the time, even with the amount of games we’d played that year.“It was the first time the press had questioned our fitness because we’d played that many games.“You’re never tired when you’re winning but as soon as you get beat that can quickly change.“Personally, all the finals don’t mean anythingyou don’t win. You want to have success by winning and savouring that.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

We have three dogs and three cats in foster that were in place before the lockdown. We are trying to support them as much as possible.\"Unfortunately, the lockdown means that we cannot re-home any animals at this time. We had people lined up to come and meet two of the dogs on the week that the country went into lockdown and had to cancel their appointments due to this.\"Also, Pal, who has been waiting for over a year for a new home, was due to go away to his new home that week which has had to be put on hold. And we have no idea when he can finally go to his new home.\"And the centre isnt just coping with the stress of caring for the animals during a crisis, theyre also facing potential financial strain as the weeks progress.\"Our centre relies heavily on income generated from our four shops,\" added Lee-Ann. \"Seventy per cent of our annual income is generated via the shops so loss of income is a real concern.\"We have had to cancel fundraising events during the key fundraising period of spring summer. This includes our Annual Dog Show in May which is one our biggest fundraising events.\"We are hopeful that not all staff go down with virus at same time.\"We are managing the situation to the best of our ability and [despite] that our weekly income has reduced very signicantly, and we need people to donate to help keep our centre operational whilst our shops are closed.\"All our animals are still being looked after and cared for by our excellent and committed staff.\"Sonia Graham from Borders Greyhound Rescue added: \"Were trying to make the best of the situation.\"We have  dogs at the moment because we cant get dogs in or out. Its dficult.\"Weve had some under fostering, but unless they are greyhound people they wont be going to foster.\"Its frustrating because for people who want dogs, youd think this was the perfect time to have one as theres time for one-on-one training.\"And a lack of volunteers is a key factor in the dficulties facing the Greyhound Rescue now, with the charity normally taking in up to  regular helpers to care for  dogs.\"Without volunteers, its been a real struggle,\" said Sonia. \"Were family-run and we have a farm too, so were just trying to fill the gaps left by volunteers.\"Another problem which has reared its head for Sonia and her family is the knock-on effect of this lockdown.Sonia explained: \"People who may have lost jobs or their business, they wont be thinking of taking on an animal.\"People cant afford to pay vet bills. I can see this being a dficult year.\"If anything, we may see animals being handed in. People will misjudge and panic about the situation. And it wont just be dogs being brought to rescues but being dumped.\"It will be interesting to see how this all works out.\"And to help ease the strain on the rescue, Sonia has created an Amazon wishlist for donations to help keep the dogs fed.The wishlist gives donors the option to either donate physical items, such as a bag of food, or they can gt a cash amount straight into the Greyhound Rescues account to spent on vital products.On the other hand, the Arthurshiel Rescue Centre, in St Boswells, hasnt seen an increase in their four-legged residents, with the charity manager Shona Middlemass saying: \"Were managing fine\".She added: \"Weve not had an influx of animals, any strays that get raised with us we share over Facebook.\"Fingers crossed everything keeps going smoothly, weve not had any problems.\"We dont have any cash coming in. Cat and dog boarding is our main source of income.\"Wed normally have five or six dogs, And Easter last year we were full with ten cats boarding.\"We rely on people going on holiday, and weve now had cancellation right up to July.\"However, the rescue has received some good news recently.Border Terrier Teddy, who went to a foster home last month, has been dubbed a failed foster, as he is likely to be kept by his foster family, finding his forever home.And its not just your average pets who are being impacted by the pandemic.The Scottish Borders Donkey Sanctuary, which was due to reopen for the Spring season in mid-March, still has donkeys available for adoption and sponsorship, and is operating as business as usual.John from the Sanctuary said: \"We hope to continue routine hoof trimming, tetanus booster injections , worming and de-lousingas and when they are due on a welfare basis.\"All the rescues are doing their best to meet social-distancing guidelines while also ensuring the well-being of their animals.Borders Pet Rescues Lee-Ann added: \"Please do not come to the centre and only contact centre by phone or email and the staff will help you as much as they can.\"If members of the public have any donations for the centre or charity shops, then we ask that you please keep them until it is safe to deliver them.\"People can donate via our Facebook and web page.\"For more information on these four rescues, you can find them at: Borders Pet Rescue, www.borderspetrescue.org Scottish Borders Greyhound Rescue, www.greyhoundtrust.org.uk Arthurshiel Rescue Centre, facebook Arthurshiel-Rescue-Centre- and The Scottish Borders Donkey Sanctuary, donkeyheaven.org"},{"url":null,"title":"ex-radio-borders-dj-went-rome-become-priest","story":"A Galashiels priest-in-training has spoken to the Borderabout his time in the Vatican and what it was like being filmed by the BBC for a new documentary, which is being aired this weekend.Former Radio Borders DJ Bobby Taylor was in his fth year at The Scots College in Rome when filming for the BBCs Priest School began in September .

Theres only been two or three guys out of - whove left.\"Me, personally, my first year was probably my toughest year. It was a big adjustment from that freedom I had, and having gone from earning quite a healthy wage working at sea, then going to seminary in a foreign country ndash it was quite a challenge.\"There was a period where I did have to really, seriously, pray about it and think about what I was being called to do.\"I think everybody goes through it, and I think its a good thing that everybody goes through because ultimately thats what seminary is about.,params: .push\"Seven years isnt a number plucked out of mid-air, its a period where youre doing a lot of study but youre also doing a lot of work to understand what it is youre being called to do, andits being called to priesthood because its not a light undertaking, its quite a serious undertaking ndash but a good one, and a positive one.\"And the problems facing Bobby and his fellow seminarians have only grown since the COVID- lockdown.He added: \"From about six weeks ago being in Rome and studying in the university with my class of about  other guys, Im now sitting in a dining room in a Catholic church house in Galashiels studying on my own.\"So things have changed quite a bit. But study still continues, its not like theyve stopped. Theres been a couple of weeks, this week and last week, which would have been the Easter holidays anyway.\"Although we may be spread out, back to our home countries, were still persevering with study.\"And in June, Bobby hopes to sit his exams which will see him move into his seventh year at the Scots College.

Olsen Cruise Lines made the dficult decision to pause our cruise operations voluntarily for a period of time, as many other cruise operators have done.ldquoIn the meantime, we have been working with Forth Ports and have secured safe, temporary anchorages for our ships in the Firth of Forth.ldquoEach ship will retain a small team on board to continue essential operations, and locals might see the ships move within the river from time to time to carry out their duties.ldquoWe look forward to brighter times ahead and to welcoming our valued guests back on board when the time is right for us all.However, eight crew members on board the Black Watch ship have tested positive for Covid- and six others are still waiting on test results.It is understood their treatment is being managed on board the ship and there are no plans for anyone to disembark.Each crew member is occupying their own cabin, each with a balcony.There are no social gatherings on board and crew only leave their cabins to perform essential duties such as bridge watch, engine watch and food preparation.Those who have tested positive or are feeling unwell are not undertaking any duties.The Braemar ship made headlines last month when it became stranded in the Caribbean with five people on board who had tested positive for the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-appreciate-nature-doorstep","story":"SPRING has sprung and normally I would be spending most of my free time exploring East Lothian for story ideas or walking in the woods, or combing the coast and finding ldquosecret magical places with my family.Irsquove always loved spring. The burst of le and colour with the longevenings resurrects my mood, enlivens my nature-loving soul. It makes our days feel longer while also giving us the extra energy to enjoy them.How can we not be uplted by the sight of a tree in full blossom bathed in sparkling sunshine, or a carpet of wild flowers especially after months of winter when the land sleeps, and the sun seems to have forgotten us But these are not normal times of course and the ability to roam in nature and soak in its wonder has been temporarily restricted. In fact for many of us our normal le routine has been totally suspended.While we are in lockdown, nature is enjoying the opposite itrsquos flourishing with new le and beauty. And while itrsquos frustrating that we cannot venture out in ways we might be used to, I have been able to listen more closely to the stories that nature is telling on my doorstep.Over the last few years I have deliberately lsquore-wildedrsquo my small garden which I am so lucky to have. By that I mean I have allowed nature to do its thing, and nature has accepted the invitation. Elder, rowan, silver birch and cherry trees now enclose my wee patch of the world. Wild flowers such as dandelion and forget-me-nots have sprung up and last year I had foxglove, so Irsquom waiting to see what this summer will bring.A strange effect of all this has been the enlarging of my garden. Not literally, but in the power of its presence. Irsquove noticed how a space full of nature feels bigger than one thatrsquos bare, lsquoneatrsquo and manicured.I like to call it the forest horizon effect. Compare standing in the middle of a wide open treeless park with standing in the middle of a wood surrounded by trees and humming le. The area of the wood may be much smaller than the park, but its impact on our senses is much greater. We are embraced by nature, not just physically but also,we feel the connection, emotionally and spiritually. The space actually feels larger than it is because there is more in it.I am missing this embrace so much right now because of the inability to visit my favourite woods. But the lockdown has compelled me to spend more time in the natural world on my back doorstep.And within the embrace of my gardenrsquos re-wilded forest horizon, although only a space of around  metres by , I have discovered the truth contained in the wonderful book by Scott Sampson How to Raise a Wild Child.In his book, Scott states: ldquoWhen I began on this book, I had a certain sense of self-satisfaction, convinced that a letime of outdoor play, hiking and campinghellip had forged within me a deep bond with naturehellip Instead, I found that, like most of us, I was oblivious to most of the natural goings-on around me.He explains how he then spent time with his daughter absorbing the sounds and sights of nature on his doorstep, which fostered their lsquointernal wildnessrsquo more than any trip to a remote wilderness. They listened to birdsong and sat quietly as small creatures played out their lersquos dramas under the shadow of their house. ldquoWildness just outside the front door, Scott writes, ldquowas helping us deepen our bond with nature. Such interactions, I have come to realise, are essential to nature connection.Reading this has given new meaning to the confinement imposed by the lockdown. Never before have I had such time to simply sit and absorb the tiny goings on in the garden, embraced by my own mini forest horizon.A garden is a privilege, of course, and I understand many donrsquot have one. But wildness can also be found on our walk to the shops, on verges and public green spaces, with trees, bushes and wild flowers that grow in our urban spaces. The trick is to pause and absorb the wonder of it, listen and look for the wee miracles that we usually donrsquot notice and walk by. Itrsquos easier now, even on a normally busy street, with so much reduced traffic noise and absence of bustle.On my exercise walk yesterday I did just this and was overwhelmed by the beauty of renewed le. It occurred to me that this precious one-walk-a-day has intensied the connection it gives me to local nature.And never have I enjoyed the privilege of having a re-wilded garden so much. On Easter Monday I sat in it with my five-year-old son. His attention span can be short but I explained what we were doing and he stayed with me for  minutes. The first thing I noticed was the absence of normal background noise, which heightened the volume of naturersquos spring melody.Our garden attracts many birds which sit on the branches and sing their hearts out. I know they donrsquot sing for us, but my young son thought they were doing just that. In just  minutes we heard or saw coal tits, wrens, wood pigeons, willow warblers, magpies and a robin. Irsquod never have previously known what some of these birds were, but now we are in a mindset to get to know who is inhabiting our lsquodoorstep wildnessrsquo.We also watched a peacock butterfly explore our garden as it fluttered and paused in equal measure. The sound of bumblebees arrived and we saw them hover over the dandelions. Then a small honey bee made an entrance, likewise visiting the dandelions. As we sat quietly, the sound of honking above us raised our heads and we saw two V formations of geese heading north.When my boy got restless, I suggested we crawl like explorers in the grass to see what we could find. We spotted an incredible sight: young garden spiders emerging from their egg sack which was half hidden under a curve in a plant pot. My sonrsquos fascination at this was matched by my own! It was early for this to happen, and we found many other egg sacks where still unhatched.Within these  minutes there was so much le and wonder so many stories to discover. Where did the small birds come from, where were the geese going, why do bees suddenly appear and what did they do during the winter  Why are dandelions so popular with the bees, what is so special about them  Why do the birds sing dferently, are they speaking to each otherso, what are they saying How did the peacock butterfly get its name and where did it hibernate, was it in our garden shed  What was it looking for  Were the hatching spiders emerging early because their mother deliberately chose a warm corner in the garden to lay her eggs  Why do some spiders live in the garden, while others like hiding under your bed  Do you know how to spot the dference, and do they spin their webs dferently These were just some of the stories my son and I wondered about after our  minutes together in our garden wilderness. But such drama happens all around us. Little patches of mini wilderness are everywhere,we hone our senses to notice and appreciate them.I realise now the lockdown, although stressful, has created the conditions for the discovery of so many new things, with so many new nature stories to learn tales of survival and adventure, of lersquos drama happening on our doorstep and in our street.And the biggest story of all is that everything around us is ultimately related. We are part of naturersquos story because we are part of nature. We share a common ancestor with every creature and plant yes, even with the trees.So while I, like us all, yearn for the end of the lockdown for many reasons, I am also going to try to make the best of it by being more aware of naturersquos wonders that are literally outside my window, while I stay at home to help keep others safe."},{"url":null,"title":"north-berwick-hotel-keeping-doors-open-key-workers","story":"The Nether Abbey Hotel shut its doors to the public last month for the first time since , and all its staff are observing the stay-at-home advice.The hotel is, however, continuing to provide a place to stay for those who are still working and need to undertake essential travel.Its owners, Jela and Stirling Stewart, wanted to follow all Government instructions, including First Minister Nicola Sturgeonrsquos request that hotels remain open to support those providing vital services.The couple said: ldquoAt first we were not sure who would need accommodation or who would be travelling.ldquoHowever, it soon became apparent that we needed to continue to provide this service, and companies are really grateful that we are open to them, albeit in a very altered state with extremely limited facilities.ldquoSo far we have had engineers who are carrying out vital works at Torness and a representative of a company who needed to travel from the south of England to repair vital agricultural equipment.ldquoWe have also had NHS staff who are working nights and then going home to try and sleep in a household with young children and just want somewhere quiet to sleep during the day ndash we are offering this service to all key NHS workers and emergency services free of charge.ldquoGuests are restricted to their rooms to protect us and the remaining couple of volunteers, and all public areas are closed off.ldquoLuckily there are still a few takeaways open, which means they can get an evening meal and we provide a breakfast for them to take to work.ldquoWe are observing a strict rota of rooms that are used and these are not entered for  hours after someone has departed to ensure we minimise all risk.

into it.I found a little information about it.It was located in Dam Brae and was said to contain water with special qualities that helped make a perfect pot of tea.There is little explanation as to what exactly these qualities were, but it seems to have been widely believed and accepted in the past.Tea, of course, became popular in Scotland, and by the th century it had become an important accompaniment to the often mundane diet of working class people, providing a refreshing non-alcoholic alternative to beer.For the poor, tea drinking wasnrsquot linked to formal social rituals as it was with the upper classes.Tea was the drink of the working class as they worked.So, a well in the heart of the town which was believed to supply good tea making water will have been a busy and popular place.Many people, likely mostly women, would have congregated around the well.In the OS name book from the s, it was clearly recorded that the well was listed as the ldquoVickerrsquos Well, but then goes on to state that ldquono person in the locality knows it by that name.Everyone called it ldquothe bickers well.Perhaps this was a result of local dialect changing the name over time.But Paul Bennet, in his interesting website ldquoThe Northern Antiquarian says ldquothere is the obvious possibility that the ldquobickers ndash as in chit-chat and gossip ndash related to it being where local folk simply met and chatted.Perhaps the reputation of the wellrsquos water for making quality tea also meant people from further afield considered it worthwhile to detour here, in order to make that extra special ldquoBickerrsquos Brew.One account says it was once surrounded by old trees.All of this conjures an image of an important social meeting place, with people meeting under the shade of old trees, exchanging views and information and having a good blether while they wait their turn to draw water from the celebrated well.Was the belief in the goodness of the water rooted in some older tradition Perhaps it was a revered holy well, as some have suggested It seems to have been associated with the vicarage of St Michaels nearby, which roots the well in Musselburghrsquos ancient past, and gives a reason for the name Vicarrsquos Well.The well was replaced by a pump sometime in the nineteenth century, and then was blocked up, and became forgotten.When Irsquod discovered all this I set out to find the location of the well to seethere was still any evidence of it.Dam Brae is now named Kilwinning Place and I studied a nineteenth century map which marked the exact location of the well, then compared it to a modern one and set out on my quest.I found the location. Irsquom sure of it, and took a photo.But there wasnrsquot really anything of much interest to see other than a slab on the ground where I believe the well once stood.It seemed so forgotten, and put me in a melancholy mood for a moment.I reflected on the way something that had been a tradition for so long, and such a part of many peoplersquos lives can just vanish, and be utterly forgotten.I know it was just a well and so might not seem important.But it was a meeting place for ordinary people for generations.The simple shared routines and places in our lives are often the ones we remember with nostalgia.We donrsquot think of them as history or worthy of recording until all memory has gone, and itrsquos too late.I thought about this as we were going on our local family walk this week.I suppose we all know we are living through a time that will be recorded by history.But when all this is over, and things are back to ldquonormal what simple things will you, and your family, remember from this time and what will you want remembered For me, this includes seeing the Greenhills carpeted with wildflowers for the first time that I can remember, watching children cycle on empty streets and deserted car parks, and queuing in shops, keeping our physical distance while also trying to stay social.For sure the toilet roll panic will be part of history.But all of us will have special moments and places that connect to the emotions of this time.There will be stories of peoplersquos wonderful community spirit, what it felt like to be confined in the house for weeks, and how we entertained ourselves.We are all historians of our own time, and we should find ways to record and remember the simple, but important, things we have felt and encountered during this time of crisis.Because memory fades, and as the fate of the Bickers Well shows,memories are not recorded or stories of them not told, they will be forgotten.And so this was why I decided to re-visit the story of the Bickers Well for my column this week.It may have originally seemed there was not much to tell about it.Yet once there was.But the memories and the stories connected to it seemed so simple and obvious at the time that nobody really thought them important enough to record or keep treasured.Now all that remains of those stories is a slab on the pavement.The technology we have makes it easier now to share and record our lives.So letrsquos use it to consciously be historians and storytellers of this dficult time to capture images and feelings, the happenings that may today seem too simple and commonplace to record, but in future will be a fascinating insight to our lives in this historic event.For me, that is the lesson of the Bickers Well."},{"url":null,"title":"winton-brewery-takes-countys-micropub","story":"Steve Holligan and David Mackinnon, from Winton Brewery, stepped behind the bar at Dunbarrsquos Station Yard Micropub at the beginning of the month.Currently, the duo are only allowed to sell off-sales, due to the coronavirus lockdown preventing customers from entering the pub, but they were looking forward to once again welcoming people inside as soon as possible.Steve said: ldquoWersquove been looking for a while to find something like this.ldquoThe Station Yard is unbelievable.ldquoWe looked in Haddington, we looked in Gullane and we wanted to stay in East Lothian, where we are from and where the brewery is based.ldquoIt was one of those things where you were scrolling through Facebook and this popped up.ldquoIt was too good an opportunity and we got in touch with Gerard McPhillips [who had created the pub alongside his late business partner David McGee] and had a really good meeting with him.

Taking the best from history and finding a way to interpret it thatrsquos interesting or unexpected.All their spirits are made by hand in small batches of less than  bottles, with a direct-fired copper pot still, and aged on-site.Since launching in , they have released three distinctive gins starting with their London Dry. Believing that classics shouldnrsquot be messed with, they have stayed true to style by creating a punchy juniper-led spirit, easing into warming spices on the palate and a bone-dry finish.This was followed by their New Tom - a modern take on the ldquoOld Tom style favoured by Illicit distillers prior to London Dry. New Tom is sweeter in character: distilled with pink peppercorns, rosehips, and tonka beans, and sweetened post-distillation with bee pollen and honey.Finally, in late , Blacklist gin was released. Setting out to create a gin with the rich smouldering character of some of their favourite whiskies - bringing together Scotlands two great spirits - they smoked juniper berries over Scottish peat to impart a deep smoky flavour to the spirit.Complimented by the addition of black cardamom, lapsang souchong tea, black peppercorns, and finally infused with activated charcoal to anchor and enhance the flavour, the result is an unconventional gin - jet black in colour - and with a heady undercurrent of smouldering peat and warming spices.All three products are currently available to via their websitewith free UK delivery during the lockdown period.See illicitspirits shop------------------------------------------------------NUDIE SNACKSNudie Snacks are a local based healthy Snacking Company headquartered in Ayrshire.

With lockdown people are finding themselves in the unusual position of being at home for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and it could be a time to experiment and push the boat out.\"I think people have a new appreciation of the craft of making things like a loaf of bread. It can take  hours to make a loaf and a couple of days to make a sourdough,\" said Giovanna. \"I tried to buy yeast in the shop this week and they had run out so it shows more people are maybe making their own.\"This week has been a special celebration in the Eusebi household as her daughter Sophia turned  and Giovanna has been providing meals for Glasgow Kindness charity which is helping to feed homeless people on the street.Her mouthwatering recipes exclusively revealed for the first time today, with stunning photos by Gerardo Jaconelli, could be the perfect treat for the family and encourage people to try something new.Giovanna added: \"Now that people are time-rich I think the focus falls on our homes. We are all eating together and it is a chance to try something new.\"I have created a fresh burrata salad this week as a special starter. And for a showstopper I have created a salt-baked fish. It is something that looks really good and is a bit of a spectacle when you crack into it.\"You cant really go wrong with it or overcook it as the salt protects it. I think people should give these things a go as they have nothing to lose.\"For a little sweet treat, Giovanna has created an Italian favourite ndash tiramisu.She added: \"I thought this menu was something that people could try at home and was maybe a special Friday night dress up meal.\"With the good weather this week Giovannas bin barbecue has been put to good use, but it was a marshmallow treat that went down well with the family.BURRATA : Fennel and anchovy saladThis is a very quick and easy starter to put together. Donrsquot be afraid to substitute any ingredients. Its important to cut the creaminess of the cheese with acidity form the orange. Salmoriglio is an easy dressing that is great for using up herbs past their best. It is also excellent on steamed greens or to marinade fish. The colours are striking and flavours inspired by Sicily.Serves Ingredients burrata or buffalo mozzarellafrac bulb of fennel or celery, sliced finely blood orange, segmented anchovy filletsMixed salad leavesCrushed pistachio to garnishSalmoriglio dressingg of fresh herbs Clove of garlicZest and juice of  lemonml of the best olive oil you haveMake the dressing: Blend all the ingredients in a food processor.To assemble: Place all ingredients except the burrata in a bowl. Season to taste. Add two-thirds of dressing. Arrange on a plate. Partially tear the burrata and place on top. Scatter over pistachios and remainder of dressing. Serve.Salt Baked FishThis is a simple, stress free way to cook fish which is a showstopper. The crust acts like an oven, sealing in the moisture, allowing the fish to cook in its on juices. Evenyou overcook it by  mins it would still be moist. This will be the tastiest fish you have ever eaten.Serves Cooking time guide: min per g whole fish approx g ndash Bass, bream, trout, turbot Salt CrustApprox - kilo of coarse saltWaterAromatics to stuff fish thick slices lemon, whole herbs Preheat oven to C F gas .Trim off fins, remove any guts of fish, you can leave scales, tail and head on.Line a baking tray with parchment.In a large bowl mix salt with water. There are no exact quantities. You are looking for a coarse wet sand texture. Imagine you are on the sea shore making sand castles!Stuff the cavity of the fish. Overlap lemon slices and pack with herbs. Experiment with herbs, its just important to fill it with something to maintain its shape and perfume the fish flesh.Use one third of the mixture for the base. Pat out into an even half inch layer. Place the fish on the bed of salt. Cover it with the remaining salt. Pat gently down until it covers the fish, like an envelope. Make sure there are no cracks.Bake for approx mins. If you have a thermometer insert it into the thickest part, it should be C, or a kne inserted into the thickest part should come away easily. Another way to test is is to remove the first spine closest to the head. If it comes out with ease then itrsquos ready. Let the fish rest for  mins. Cut round the circumference of the salt casing. You should be able to lt it off. Discard. Brush away any excess salt.To serve run your kne down the spine of the fish between the two fillets and gently lt off. Serve with wedge of lemon and drizzle over your best olive oil.Tip: If the fish is slightly undercooked, donrsquot worry just pop it back into the oven for a few more minutes .Eusebi TiramisuAn iconic, classic Italian dessert to \"pick us up\" in lockdown.

They go at it like bargain hunters rummaging in a sale. The hills are hidden by mist and as we have breakfast, the village green is empty, apart from two scampering young squirrels, getting their hourrsquos daily exercise. A glossy male pheasant hurries down the lane ashersquos late for church. Yesterday he was making a racket in the next-door garden, ashe owned the place. Once hersquos gone, nothing stirs in Hoolet until mid-morning, when a cyclist goes past, bent over her narrow wheels like a racer in a Sempeacute cartoon. Shortly afterwards, a police car drives by. The sun has burned off the mist, and by eleven it almost feels like summer. Sundays are always leisurely here, but since lockdown, they stretch to infinity.A week after arriving in Hoolet, I started a diary. It is not the sort that the writer secretly hopes will be found posthumously and published as a literary masterpiece, more a haphazard reminder of how we have adjusted to a dferent mode of living, and a record of the people and wildle around us.Real diarists have a natural ability to condense the essence of a day into a few lines, but they put as much thought into their prose as any novelist or poet. In some ways theirs is an even harder task, because it requires a special kind of imagination and flair to turn the everyday ndash each and every day ndash into something noteworthy.The proleration of citizen diarists airing their thoughts on the coronavirus crisis has turned my mind to diaries. My own random jottings occasionally refer to the crisis, but there is something paralysing about its scale that makes it hard to capture in the passing, seemingly casual way diarising requires. Instead, I am absorbed by the outdoors: the new hole Irsquove found among the roots of the beech hedge ndash foraging thrush or resident rodent  the absence of the toad that moved into our rockery two years ago and the arrival of fat, low-flying bumblebees, which zig-zag across the garden, loud as drones.The great diarists, from Pepys and Dorothy Wordsworth to Alan Bennett, donrsquot need a crisis to fill their pages, but when one comes along, their perspective is invaluable. History ndash as this awful situation one day will be ndash is at its most immediate when captured in small personal details demonstrating one inidual getting by. Thatrsquos why I enjoy diaries so much, and there are none I like better than those that are country-based.This wasnrsquot always the case. I remember as a girl a book whose flowery cover filled me with the same dread as the thought of being obliged to wear a flouncy frock. The Diary of an Edwardian Lady was a bestseller in the late s. A beautully illustrated journal it was by Edith Holden, an artist from Birmingham. Reading it now, I realise what I was missing. The drawings of birds and plants are charming, and the entries show a woman after my own heart. The one for  April, , reads: ldquoSaw two live vipers which had been brought in from the moor one of them was more than two feet long. The gentleman who had captured them handled them quite fearlessly, held up one by the back of the neck and forcing its mouth open with a stick, he showed me the two little pink fangs in the upper jaw. When on the ground they reared themselves up and hissed, and struck repeatedly at a walking stick placed in front of them.Irsquove yet to see a snake in Hoolet, so have added that to the wish list. I did once almost step on an adder barefoot as a young child, in Tarland, Aberdeenshire, where it slithered out of the tree stump I was perched on. I got a closer look some years later, on a Borders forest track, where one was sunning itself. Like a fool, I got within touching distance, thinking it was dead, before it unfurled itself like a Catherine Wheel and disappeared into the undergrowth.Living as I do with a diary anthologist, the house is filled with them. Among my favourites is the th-century clergyman, the Reverend James Woodforde, who lived in Norfolk. Better than any documentary, he brings his shire alive with accounts of chimneys going on fire, deaths on horseback, moonlit evenings when hersquod go out for bibulous dinners he later regretted. Most pertinently for Alan this past  days when, with all dentistsrsquo practices and dental hospitals indefinitely closed, desperate measures have been contemplated, Woodforde gives an account of having a tooth pulled in . It was not a success: ldquohe broke away a great Piece of my Gum and broke one of the Fangs of the Tooth it gave me exquisite Pain all the Day after and my Face swelled prodigiously. He realised too late that the chap was no longer in his prime: ldquoHe is too old I think to draw Teeth, canrsquot see very well.Country diarists record fox hunts and deer stalking, tree-felling storms, village feuds, cake competitions and frog-spawnings, but there is relatively little about the great affairs of state. During World War One, for instance, Alice Dudney, from Lewes, reports her own war against slugs with far greater assiduity than what was taking place on the western front. I donrsquot think this was because country dwellers in previous centuries were less interested in the news, evenit sometimes arrived days or weeks after events. But back then, country living was hard. What was happening on your doorstep was of more pressing concern unless loved ones were in the firing line.Itrsquos quite the opposite in Hoolet. The few conversations now held ndash through a hedge, across a garden wall, or in passing up in the woods ndash are all about the pandemic, and the best stratagems for getting by. A diary on this subject alone risks deepening the gloom. Where better to find distraction and consolation than in whatrsquos going on right outside the window  Such as the wonderful news that a blue tit has moved into the nest box on our garden shed ndash the original definition of Airbnb.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions. They do not necessarily represent the views of The Herald."},{"url":null,"title":"make-beauty-treatments-store-cupboard-staples","story":"If therersquos anything coronavirus crisis has taught us, it is that constant scrubbing will give us the withered hands of a -year-old tattie howker.Which is fine should you want your wrinkled, shrivelled hands to co-ordinate with the deep worry lines etched across your face and your lanky grey roots.However, denied access to our usual choice of pampering products and expensive beauty salon treatments, subjected to  hours a day indoors with nothing to do but scrub the kitchen worktop with bleach, our dreadful-looking skin simply matches the national mood: sad.Of course, looking flawless while in the grip of a pandemic is hardly a top priority, butwe do want to spruce up and avoid looking like a sundried raisin, help ndash it would appear ndash is hiding behind the panic-bought dried pasta in the kitchen cupboard.According to personal finance site TheMoneyPig, the kitchen larder offers a wealth of potential beauty fixes ndashwe can get over the idea of slapping good food all over our faces.It claims everyday kitchen ingredients ndash from olive oil to rice, porridge oats, even tea and milk ndash have been used for centuries to stave off the impacts of ageing, sun and bacteria, and could help keep the impact of all that modern alcohol-based sanitiser and soap at bay.Even better, whipping up a homemade skin remedy will cost a fraction of a fancy beauty salon treatment ndash handy when itrsquos not clear where next monthrsquos money is coming from.Plus,it all goes wrong, you can at least eat what yoursquove made for dinner.Among its suggestions is to follow in the perfectly pedicured footsteps of Cleopatra and embrace the beauty benefits of milk ndash a good idea at a time when dairy producers have been left with the headache of how to sell millions of gallons of unused milk.Therersquos no need to fill a bath ndash unless you really want to emerge with clean pores but smelling like old yoghurt. Instead, the site suggests mixing it with green tea as a natural toner.Should you be missing the skin-smoothing effect of an eye-watering beauty salon chemical peel, you may want to follow the online sitersquos alternative: granulated sugar, mixed with olive oil then a right good rub.For those who can spare some beer, its yeast content will help fight excessive sebum production and the bacteria that causes acne.Mix with egg whites and mashed strawberries then use as a face pack ndash or just pretend itrsquos a beery kind of meringue and eat it.While the websitersquos store cupboard treatments may seem a shade desperate, according to Claire Gray of Glasgow-based skincare specialist Ermana, there is real merit in seeking out a more natural approach to our skincare regimes.ldquoAt the moment, most of us are focused on shopping for essentials such as food and medicine, and skincare is often viewed as a luxury product, she says.ldquoBut all this time indoors and washing our hands is having an impact on our skin.For eyes strained from peering too long at Tiger King on Netflix, she has an age-old remedy: ldquoThe tannins in tea can help reduce puffiness and get rid of dark circles. Simply soak a tea bag in warm water and place on your eyes for  minutes.ldquoFor an astringent or toner, wipe a teabag over your face to tighten skin and then blot with a towel.With coffee shops closed and our espresso fix now confined to home, there is a use for all those spent coffee grounds. ldquoSimply add some coffee grounds to coconut oil to make your own at-home scrub, she says.ldquoThe coffee grains help remove dirt and dead skin cells and promote overall skin health, and the scrubbing action stimulates blood flow and can help to reduce cellulite.ldquoThe caffeine in coffee grounds has potent antioxidant properties that can help protect the skin from sun damage.While honeyrsquos antibacterial, anti-fungal and antiseptic properties mean it makes a handy face mask, so too do the fats, minerals and vitamins in mashed avocado.Pineapple is almost a skincare superfood: vitamin C, bromelain and antioxidants can help prevent and treat acne, fine lines, sun damage and uneven tone. Rub it on, leave for a few minutes and rinse off.Gray suggests therersquos even a skincare use for that bottle of apple cider vinegar lurking at the back of the cupboard. ldquoThe main ingredient in apple cider vinegar is acetic acid but it also contains lots of other natural alpha-hydroxy acids, she says.ldquoThese work together to gently exfoliate the skin by dissolving dead skin cells. Applying apple cider vinegar to the skin also delivers beneficial enzymes, proteins and good bacteria.With hand-washing a national hobby, she suggests taking particular care when choosing which soaps to buy.ldquoHandwashes contain water and any product with water has preservatives to stop it degrading. Andit says lsquoparfumrsquo on the bottle, itrsquoll have a multitude of sins.ldquoItrsquos much better to choose a natural soap, such as one made with olive oil.Helen Atherton of Edinburgh-based soap specialist, Dook, agrees that while washing hands with soap is a proven virus-killer, many harsh supermarket soaps will also wreck our hands.ldquoThe dference between a bar of handmade soap and a manufactured one is huge, she says. ldquoIn handmade soaps, the natural glycerine thatrsquos squeezed out in the industrial process is retained. So handmade soap is much kinder but will still destroy viruses.She uses coconut oil, shea butter, essential oils and Himalayan salt to make her organic soap, but strongly advises against attempting to break out the saucepans to rustle up your own bar.ldquoIf yoursquore not careful, homemade soap can go a bit rubbish ndash therersquos chemistry involved, caustic soda. You need gloves and eye protection.ldquoGet it wrong and yoursquoll end up with a soap dish full of sloppy soap or, worse, in AE.www.ermanawww.dookofedinburghThe store-cupboard spa: the everyday ingredients with magical propertiesAssuming yoursquove not already eaten the entire contents of your kitchen, you could be rustling up a very tasty skin solution.Olive oil: Adored by the ancient Egyptians for smoothing hair and skin, gently heat and massage into the scalp for a conditioning treatment, or mix with aloe vera for a hand moisturiser.Honey: Packed with natural antibacterial properties, add to a bath to help reduce inflammation or combine with ground almonds for a cleansing face and body scrub.

There is no other artist who documented Glasgow so extraordinarily during that period. Itrsquos not enough for Scottish art and big institutions like Kelvingrove to be limited to the most popular names like the Glasgow Boys, Jack Vettriano or Charles Rennie Mackintosh.ldquoPeople are very familiar with the work of the Glasgow Boys. But Glasgow has other painters. Therersquos a Glasgow Girl. Shersquos not even Scottish but came here and fell in love with the city to such an extent that she painted it throughout her short le. Eardley is a hugely important British artist and she should have a major exhibition in a British institution of note, like the Tate.Eardley was born on May , , on a dairy farm in Warnham, Sussex. Her family later moved to London and then, in , amid the growing threat of war, to Bearsden.The following year, she began her studies at Glasgow School of Art and proved fearless in her pursuit of subjects to paint. Her wanderings brought her to impoverished Townhead in the northeast of the city, where she established a studio. The paintings Eardley did there ndash particularly her famous portraits of the Samson children ndash are considered landmarks of th-century art.For her niece Anne Morrison, a Bearsden-based ceramicist, Eardleyrsquos relationship with an urban district which was facing the demolition ball is an example of just how daring and exceptional she was.ldquoTownhead was just not the area that you would go to ndash I was kept well away from it, she said. ldquoEven my brother, who was a couple of years older, said he had never been up there either. It was not the place to be. It was just the poverty and seeing what that part of Glasgow looked like. Middle-class kids just did not get taken there.ldquoShe actually caught something that was disappearing at the time, as the buildings were getting knocked down and people were getting moved where. It captured something of the city and the children there. Itrsquos not glorying it but itrsquos capturing it in a very human way.Morrison suggested that the lack of a major event to mark the centenary of Eardleyrsquos birth could have something to do with the Scottishness of her work.ldquoIt does seem right to have a celebration of her work but it does not seem to be happening, she added. ldquoHer name gets forgotten. She has not had the recognition at a UK level that she should. Thatrsquos the trouble. Shersquos a Scottish artist and she gets put aside because her subjects were Scottish as well.Laura Cumming, art critic for The Observer, described Eardley as ldquoone of the deepest landscape artists who ever lived, and among the most humanitarian painters of men, women and especially children.She added: ldquoEvery opportunity to see her work is precious ndash anywhere at all.ldquoThere have been shows in Scotland, the last that I remember was in . She deserves many more, and so the ideal would be a touring show that took in London, presenting her work throughout the United Kingdom to a new generation. Next year must not be allowed to slip by without a full-scale retrospective of her powerfully stirring and beautul work.Arts journalist Jan Patience said: ldquoThe National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh has done a power of work to cement her reputation with two major shows in the last  years, but there has been no major Eardley show for years in Glasgow, the city she called home. I believe the last one was in what was then called The Third Eye Centre in the s.ldquoAn Eardley show in Glasgow would attract visitors in their thousands and a no-show in her centenary year shows a real lack of vision.Local authorities in Scotlandrsquos largest cities said events were being organised or considered to mark the anniversary.A spokeswoman for Glasgow Le said: ldquoAs one of Scotlandrsquos most popular th-century artists we anticipate a small programme of events to mark Joan Eardleyrsquos centenary.ldquoWe are pleased to have a small number of her drawings and paintings in our collection, which includes the much-loved oil Glasgow Kids, a Saturday Matineacutee Picture Queue, on show in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. However, we do not hold the breadth of works required to stage a standalone exhibition.An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: ldquoEardleyrsquos work is showcased as one of the Our Collection highlights in Gallery  ndash Collecting Art and her work can be seen throughout the collections galleries. A number of the oils we own are on display, including a powerful seascape painted at Catterline.ldquoThe  centenary of Joan Eardleyrsquos birth presents a welcome opportunity for us to celebrate the artistrsquos strong connection with the northeast of Scotland in a number of ways.A spokesman for Leisure and Culture Dundee, which runs the McManus Gallery and Museum, said: ldquoWe have no current plans to mark the Joan Eardley centenary next year.A spokesman for the National Galleries of Scotland said: ldquoThe National Galleries celebrated the le and work of Joan Eardley in a comprehensive exhibition just three years ago, and the exhibitionrsquos curator Patrick Elliott, a leading expert on Eardley, is writing a book on Eardley and Catterline as part of the centenary celebrations. All future plans, including publication of this book and our exhibition schedule, are subject to review due to the ongoing health crisis. However, we do intend on marking Eardleyrsquos centenary next summer, in one form or another.The Tate galleries declined to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-chance-build-better-scotland---together","story":"And when lockdown in its most severe form does start to be eased, it is likely that the process will be a very slow and gradual one, with only \"baby steps\" to start with. The virus is not going to magically disappear, so our challenge is to find a way to live alongside it ndash to continue to suppress it, while restoring some normality to our lives. That will not be easy.Thatrsquos why this week I spoke about the search for a \"new normal\". A way in which we, as a society, can live alongside coronavirusin a way that keeps it under control and limits the damage that is does.This new normal will be very dferent from the lives we had before. Physical distancing and limiting our contact with others will be a fact of le for a long time to come. That is the unavoidable reality: we are going to have to learn to live with Covid-.We will all have to adjust to that, certainly until treatments and, ultimately, a vaccine can provide us with an alternative way forward.What I am sure of is thatwe keep doing the right things, there will be a way through ndash and I am also confident we can because of the compassion, determination and expertise of the people of Scotland.These strengths will help see us move through this crisis, and come out the other side. We will make that journey based on our common values, our principles and the best scientic knowledge.But as we make that journey, dficult and challenging as it will be, we can also start to talk about our destination.When things come apart ndash when the kaleidoscope of our lives is shaken ndash there is an opportunity to see them put back together dferently, and see a new way of doing things.And we can start to think together, and work together, to decide the kind of Scotland we want to emerge from this crisis.We still all face major challenges. Challenges in navigating the uncertainties that the virus has created, as well as rebuilding our economy and public services.But we can go further than rebuilding, and look seriously at social and economic reform.Before this crisis, we were focused on our mission of making Scotland a greener, fairer and more prosperous country. That has not changed. But the place from where we are starting has.I have spoken before about the fundamental conversations we should be having in our society. What do we value in the communities that we live in, and what kind of country, and what kind of society do we really want to be  We have talked about the importance of promoting wellbeing. Those considerations seem ever more important now.We must focus on how we support our people to adapt to this new world. We will have to be honest about the traumatic effect this pandemic has had on our society, and how we must all confront its impact, the anguish and loss it has caused.Our support must also be practical, such as giving people the skills to respond to the inevitable changes in the labour market.It means helping businesses deal with the transition out of this crisis by aiding their efforts to change their business models and practices, with an eye to the markets that will grow in the future.Our public services will also have to change.They will need to help families and communities recover from the disorientating shock of these times, as well as harnessing the kindness and compassion that has poured from people up and down the country.Even as Scotland begins to plan a managed transition away from current restrictions, we must still adhere to the advice ndash stay at homeyou have the symptoms, keep physically distanced, and maintain hand and cough hygiene.As and when we lt restrictions, we will need to put in place public health measures to stop an uncontrolled peak of cases that would require ato lockdown.We must also still protect the most vulnerable sections of society. Perhaps we can look at how some people could meet in small groups, in defined lsquobubblesrsquo of contact.We can also consider how we can re-open schools, most likely in a very gradual and phased way we will need to consider how we can do this while maintaining physical distancing.While we think about these ideas, our plans to recover must take account of the possibility of re-imposing restrictions, and recognise the possibility that they could be re-imposed quickly.The pandemic has changed the way societies and economies across the world operate, and Scotland is no dferent.I am confident we can start to begin considering our futures with optimism because this crisis has taught us how we can achieve rapid results under the most demanding circumstances. We have seen our NHS respond with radical action, and a new medical facility built in Glasgow with speed, skill and expertise.This crisis has also prompted us to drive change that otherwise may not have been so urgent ndash such as the increased use of online tools to reduce travel and work from home.We have also seen the great capacity of our society to work together in a common purpose.We must now take these lessons into the planning of how we recover from this crisis, and how we will live our lives in the \"new normal\" that awaits us all."},{"url":null,"title":"new-normal-first-minister-calls-united-effort-build-better-scotland","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has called on the people of Scotland to work together to create a new, better nation our of the devastation caused by the coronavirus.The First Minister said the virus had shaken Scots lives to their core but that \"there is an opportunity to see them put back together dferently, and see a new way of doing things\".But rather than just restoring what had been wrecked, Sturgeon said the crisis had presented the chance to \"think together, and work together, to decide the kind of Scotland we want\".Writing exclusively in The Herald on Sunday, she said: \"We can go further than rebuilding, and look seriously at social and economic reform.\"Before this crisis, we were focused on our mission of making Scotland a greener, fairer and more prosperous country.

We have seen the great capacity of our society to work together in a common purpose.\"Sturgeon this week became the first UK leader to discuss how le will look after the crisis has passed.UK Ministers have been reluctant to talk publicly about an exit strategy, arguing that it risks undermining the message that people should stay at home in order to curb the spread of the disease.However, there are signs that they are now looking at ways in which restrictions could be eased without risking another flare-up of the virus.One option could see people allowed to socialise with up to  of their closest family and friends, with small groups of households allowed to \"cluster\" together.This could enable family members to meet for meals or friends to share childcare. It could also allow couples who do not live together to see each other.Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunak is drawing up measures to enable businesses to reopen in a \"safe and practical way\".Provisions are said to include putting up signs telling workers to stay two metres apart and to go homethey have coronavirus symptoms.Communal areas such as canteens would be closed unless people could maintain social distancing, and firms would have to ensure there are widespread hand-washing facilities and hand gel.Former chancellor Philip Hammond said it is essential that businesses are told now what requirements they will have to fulfil when the time comes to reopen so they can begin preparing.\"If we are all going to have to wear face masks travelling on public transport, businesses need to know that now so that businesses that have the capacity to manufacture products like that can start planning to do so,\" he said.\"If restaurants, when they eventually reopen, are going to have to operate with many fewer tables, they need to start thinking about how they adapt their business model to be able to do that.\"At the moment, for too many businesses, they just dont know what the requirements imposed on them are going to look like and therefore what kind of preparations they need to make.\"Hospitals, businesses and schools in Scotland are all expecting a dferent landscape under the \"new normal\", post-lockdown le.Simon Barker, a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon in Aberdeen and former chair of BMA Scolands consultants committee, said there are still a lot of unknowns about how and when normality will be restored to services.Barker stressed that some delayed patients would have to wait until  for surgery.\"Its very heartening to have people clapping for the NHS on a Thursday but were going to need those same people to have a measure of understanding when this ends and they want their hip replacement done, and unfortunately we do not have the capacity to do everybody within a week. Its going to take months to catch up.\"New guidance unveiled from the British Retail Consortium suggests non-food retailers could introduce similar measures to supermarkets to enable shoppers toto safely browsing stores for clothes, household furnishings and beauty items, and garden centres for plants.Like supermarkets, the strategy ndash which is supported by the consortiumrsquos Scottish counterpart ndash would see only limited numbers of shoppers allowed inside shops at any one time.There will also be flexi-plastic barriers at till points, floor markings to keep shoppers separated by two metres and changing rooms and in-store cafes almost certainly closed.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, said: ldquoOur members in pharmacy, grocery and the retailing of pet food have shown during this crisis that it is possible to operate safely and responsibly in this new environment.\"With any reopening of shops in Scotland likely to be undertaken on a phased basis, once government permits trading, this new guide will assist retailers to operate safely and help get the economy moving again.ldquoIt will help customers understand changes to their usual shopping routine and indeed what is expected of them too.Pubs and restaurants are expected to be among the last businesses allowed to re-open and they will have drastically fewer customers when they do trade again.Paul Waterson, spokesman for the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, said: ldquoSocial distancing will probably mean tables being spread out, some places may have bar service only with people queuing responsibly to be served, or waiter service only.ldquoIt will be very dficult some smaller premises with a capacity of just  or  people. For them, social distancing may mean they can only have  or  people in at a time. They will have to decideitrsquos worthwhile opening.According to Ryan James, chairman of the Glasgow Restaurant Association and owner of Two Fat Ladies, some restaurants may choose to follow the lead of some European restaurants and fit plastic shields around tables.ldquoWe anticipate being in the last tranche of places that are able to open, he said. ldquoWe expect tables to have to be moved so they are two metres apart ndash in some places that could mean restaurants losing up to % of their business.ldquoI think the days of entire families of groups of  people at a time dining out are gone for the moment.Schools are already having discussions behind the scenes to lay the foundation for ato school.Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS, said: \"We could be looking at smaller class sizes or perhaps children attending in either the morning or afternoon.ldquoI think reopening is likely to involve some prioritisation of certain learning groups or part-time education in some instances to ensure that physical buildings can comply with social distancing and avoid pupils congregating while still accessing all the hand-washing and practical things we need."},{"url":null,"title":"world-view-sweden-tackling-coronavirus","story":"Once upon a very long time ago I lived in Sweden. It wasnrsquot an especially y stay, probably a little over a year or so. I had gone there with my then partner who was Swedish and whom I had met while working as a correspondent in Jerusalem, where she too was based for a time.Living as we did in the Swedish capital Stockholm, the contrast with our time in the Middle East could not have been starker.In the beginning I never warmed to Stockholm. I found it lacking in the spontaneity and colour I had so much enjoyed while in Jerusalem. Somehow it seemed tame, quiet and conservative even, despite the countryrsquos liberal reputation.As time when on, however, and I became accustomed to Swedish ways, the place grew on me. Today Stockholm has become a city I love and is home to one of my closest friends with whom on occasion I continue to work alongside overseas when not having regular online chats.These days almost iniably much of our conversation revolves around comparing notes on the coronavirus and our respective experience of lockdown.Even from the start of the pandemicrsquos impact in Europe, what my friend told me about Swedenrsquos way of tacking the virus made me sit up and take notice.Irsquom not alone in this reaction given that Sweden now has one of the worldsrsquo most closely watched and controversial coronavirus response strategies.Itrsquos a strategy that has been met with both some confusion by ordinary Swedes as well as criticism from within certain sections of the countryrsquos scientic, political and media community. So, just what is it that Sweden is doing dferently and what has the reaction been at home and away At first glance there might not seem many dferences compared to other countries responses. In Sweden as where people are encouraged to practice social distancing, work from homepossible, and avoid non-essential travel as well as visits to elderly relatives or hospitals.In fact, a survey from Swedish pollsters Kantar So carried out for the countryrsquos Civil Contingencies Agencyshowed that around % of people in Sweden say they have reduced their participation in social activities to stop the spread of the infection.But where Sweden has dfered in achieving its aims in response to the virus is that the government has relied on voluntary measures, urging citizens to act responsibly and adhere to these guidelines rather than enforcing a lockdown.All of this has given the country an air of remaining open for business, evenitrsquos not exactly business as usual. Primary schools, cafes, gyms, bars and restaurants, and most businesses have continued tothroughout the spread of the pandemic.Some critics of the policy, both domestic and international, have been alarmed to say the least, but there remains little evidence that Swedes are underplaying the enormity of the disease rampaging across the globe.The architect of the controversial policy the country has adopted, and hero or villain of the piece depending on the Swedes you talk to, is Anders Tegnell, state epidemiologist at Folkhaumllsomyndigheten, Swedenrsquos public health authority.The -year-old has become a household name in Sweden, appearing across the media and holding daily briefings outlining the progression of the outbreak with a precise, quiet demeanour.Asked last week at a press conference as to why the government had chosen not to lock down the country, Tegnell reiterated its position.ldquoBasically because we think we can achieve the same results with voluntary measures, and I think that to a great extent we have shown that we can do that, came Tegnellrsquos characteristically frank reply.This candour has been a hallmark of the countryrsquos approach to tackling the pandemic in its midst.ldquoWersquore trying this strategy out. We donrsquot knowit will work or not. If it doesnrsquot, wersquoll revisit it, Tegnell openly admitted few weeks ago.To date hersquos stuck to his guns, but not everyone in Sweden agrees or approves, pointing to the fact that more people so far have died in Sweden compared to its Nordic neighbours.At the time of writing, Sweden has , confirmed Covid- cases and , people have died. According to figures from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Sweden at face value is not doing well.By April , its mortality rates from Covid- were the tenth highest in the world, with . deaths per ,. By comparison, its neighbours Denmark, Norway and Finland ranked th, nd and st, with ., . and . deaths per ,.More than half of Swedenrsquos deaths have so far occurred in Stockholm ndash , as of April  ndash yet only % of the population lives there. Bad as all this is, itrsquos still a far cry from those European countries worst hit.Currently a lot of the anger in Sweden over its case and fatality figures has come from a perceived lack of shielding of older people. More than one-third of fatalities have been the elderly living in care homes.Just a few weeks ago in light of this death toll, Swedenrsquos prime minister Stefan Lofven suggested the government might need to review its approach amid the prospect of many more fatalities.He accepted too that the failure to protect people in nursing homes stood out as a clear weakness of the governmentrsquos strategy, contributing to higher death rates than in neighbouring Scandinavian countries.ldquoThe protection for people in elderly care should have been better, Lofven admitted last week. ldquoWe need to look closer at what has gone wrong.Some Swedes have suggested that their country is deviating from most other nationsrsquo response in order to hasten herd immunity, and in doing so risking lives unnecessarily. The public health authority denies this.Inevitably, as in countries where facing the threat from the virus, this has resulted in some confusion and a polarisation of opinion.ldquoThe mixed messages are plentul, and they seem to make people want to pick sides, dig their heels in, argue that in Sweden we have a system and it works or no, Swedes always think they know best but they donrsquot, observed journalist Emma Lofgren, writing in the Swedish edition of the online newspaper The Local.Some, however, are adamant over the stance they take. Lena Einhorn, a virologist who has been one of the leading domestic critics of Swedenrsquos coronavirus policy, recently told The Observer newspaper that the government and the health authority were still resisting the most obvious explanations for many of the deaths from the virus.She argues that the reason why there has been such a high number of deaths in care homes is not because of the homes themselves, but because of Swedenrsquos decision not to close down other public facilities and amenities.Einhorn is one of  doctors, virologists and researchers who recently criticised the health authority in an op-ed published by Swedenrsquos Dagens Nyheter newspaper.It called on politicians to break with the countryrsquos tradition of entrusting policy to its expert agencies, and to seize control of Swedenrsquos coronavirus strategy from the health authority.ldquoThe approach must be changed radically and quickly, the group wrote. ldquoAs the virus spreads, it is necessary to increase social distance. Close schools and restaurants. Everyone who works with the elderly must wear adequate protective equipment. Quarantine the whole familyone member is ill or tests positive. Elected representatives must intervene, there is no other choice, the signatories to the newspaper article implored.But despite such criticisms recent polling suggests that overall prime minister Lofvenrsquos strategy continues to have the support of Swedes. His personal popularity has soared, as has that of Anders Tegnell.In accounting for this robust public display of confidence, experts point to a number of underlying factors, not least of which is the collective trust that Swedenrsquos citizens are recognised for having in their government and officials.The country has long benefited from a politically and socially stable democracy, with a well-institutionalised rule of law, transparency, and accountability.This is a nation too with a constitution that doesnrsquot allow for a state of emergency during peacetime.In other countries where such a measure exists it allows their governments to impose tougher restrictions during times of crises, something many of them have done in their efforts to combat the pandemic.According to historian Lars Tragardh, of Ersta Skoumlndal University College in Stockholm, a strict law in Swedenrsquos constitution prohibits the government from meddling in the affairs of the administrative authorities, such as the public health agency.ldquoTherefore, you donrsquot need to micromanage or control behaviour at a detailed level through prohibitions or threat of sanctions or fines or imprisonment, Tragardh told the New York Times recently. ldquoThat is how Sweden stands apart, even from Denmark and Norway.Social solidarity among citizens is also a feature in this manestation of trust.ldquoIn Sweden, the path chosen may be less draconian but it is possibly more demanding, since it shts the burden from laws and policing to self-regulation, explained Tragardh in a recent article inexamining this trust between citizens and the state and among citizens themselves.Culture matters too in how any country reacts to a crisis such as the coronavirus ndash and Sweden is no exception.In an essay written for the New York Review of Books a few years ago examining why Sweden as a country so often evokes such a strong reaction, author Paul Rapacioli talked of the social precept in Nordic countries called Jantelagen, the law of Jante, a code of conduct which is said to restrain outward displays of success or excessive inidualism.ldquoIt is a reminder that you are no better than your neighbour. This may place an obligation of modesty on Swedes, but for Sweden itself dferent rules evidently apply, observed Rapacioli.ldquoIn ranking after ranking, whether the metric is social justice, democracy, press freedom, gender equality, rule of law, innovation, or sustainable development, the country consistently places in the top , and often in the top three, added Rapacioli, reinforcing Swedenrsquos reputation for often doing things dferently and well.Amid the seriousness of the situation, however, Swedes, like others where in the world faced with the coronavirus threat, have also responded with their own brand of humour.Currently the internet is awash with jokes about how naturally social distancing comes to the countryrsquos citizens and the many years in which they have been in training for just such a scenario.ldquoSwedes, especially of the older generation, have a genetic disposition to social distancing anyway, quipped former prime minister Carl Bildt recently, echoing the other widely held view that Sweden is,not coronavirus-proof, certainly naturally coronavirus-resistant.But all joking aside, while the country to date has stood out for its relaxed approach to fighting the pandemic, on Friday there were signs the government may adopt a tougher approach in enforcing social distancing guidelines after throngs of people headed for parks, bars and restaurants to make the most of the warm weather.Interior minister Mikael Damberg was at pains to urge Swedes not to let down their guard.ldquoIn some places and in some situations, the recommendations arenrsquot being followed, warned Damberg, while stressing that most people in Stockholm are acting responsibly.As many bars, restaurants and businesses this weekend remain open, le in the city, as my friend in Stockholm told me last week, ldquofeels strangely normal.For now, the Swedish government has held fast to its almost unique approach in tackling the virus, intoning repeatedly that it is acting according to scientic advice and data and not, it implies, according to the political considerations that are motivating some of Swedenrsquos neighbours and other countries.For the moment the countryrsquos ldquonew normal in the face of the coronavirus pandemic looks remarkably like the ldquoold normal.In tackling the pandemic on its doorstep, Sweden has certainly done things dferently.Whether it has done things effectively and well, time is yet to tell."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-missed-six-coronavirus-cobra-meetings-virus-spread-scotland","story":"The Sunday Mail revealed the First Minister skipped the crucial UK Government meetings and did not attend her first until March  -

It includes , testing kits, as well as another  million face masks.However drivers sent to collect the kit for depots in NHS Lanarkshire were refused access.At the Scottish Governmentrsquos daily press briefing, Ms Freeman was asked about the blunder.She said: ldquoThis is a really important shipment for us. It contains m fluid-resistant masks. It also has , testing kits that are important.ldquoAlso in the shipment is a million of those fluid-resistant masks which are bound for NHS Wales. So it is important.ldquoWhat we need is that it was possible that the fact that shipment didnrsquot have a label on the boxes, but had a note inside the boxes, may not be sufficient to clear them out of the airport and get them to where we need them to be.ldquoBut we took the view that it was better to have that aircraft with that important cargoe sitting on a runway in an airport in Scotland than sitting on the runway in China.ldquoSo we now have it here. It has all that important cargo.

The labelling question will be resolved this week.ldquoIn terms of the drivers being there [to take it away on Friday], we thought it was better to have them there on the basis that the absence of label but the presence of a proper note inside each of the boxes would be sufficient, and the drivers were there then to take the cargo to where it needed to go.ldquoThat didnrsquot out to to be the case but it was a sensible bit of forward-planning.:World view: how Sweden are tackling coronavirusScottish Labour health spokesperson Monica Lennon said: ldquoIf much-needed PPE is still stuck there, we need to know the reason why and when it will finally reach the frontline.NHS National Services Scotland, the health servicersquos procurement arm, said: ldquoNSS ensures the quality and accuracy of all its purchased products is a priority.ldquoWhere labelling or other detail deviates from this, we work with our suppliers to quickly resolve, using well established procedures.ldquoIn this case we are working with our partners to ensure all required labelling is is place and have confidence that thus has no delay in any product being available.A Scottish Government spokesperson added: The PPE was timed to arrive substantially in advance of when it will actually be needed for distribution - which in current trends will not be for at least three weeks."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-time-scotland-go-way-lockdown","story":"This independent group, whose membership remains a closely guarded secret, finds itself centre stage at present due to the ongoing critical issues linked to the Coronavirus. The fact that Mr Cummings and his fellow Vote Leave strategist, Ben Warner, appear to have taken part in SAGE deliberations must be of serious concern to anyone who believes in an open-minded and independent group ldquofollowing the science and arriving at decisions concerning the virus for the common good and not tainted with political overtones.From all accounts it would seem that Mr Cummings has been an active participant in discussions and decision-making rather than simply an interested observer. This becomes more sinister and of grave concern when you consider his well-publicised contempt for the NHS, record of electoral fraud and more than a passing interest in the field of eugenics. Mr Cummings was allegedly an advocate of a herd immunity strategy for the UK in early March, which was mirrored by the Prime Ministerrsquos ldquo take it on the chin ramblings as the Government tried to figure out how to cope with the virus without losing support or damaging the economy. In short, Mr Cummingsrsquos presence on SAGE whilst denying a place for the chief medical officers of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales is firm evidence that the Conservative Government is placing unfair political pressure on the group to ensure the science matches their political message both for the pre and post- lockdown periods.The First Minister has opened discussions about what a gradual ending to the lockdown may look like in the weeks and months ahead whilst at the same time, influential Conservative groups like the  Committee has stressed that businesses must be allowed to restart the economy as soon as possible, eventhere remains a signicant tangible risk to le. Government pressure on our experts must not sacrice lives for party ideology and wealth creation. Economies bounce back but, sadly, people do not.Whilst Nicola Sturgeon has talked of using Angela Merkelrsquos Germany as a model in future planning, the Prime Ministers first post-inidual virus communication was with President Trump, a public advocate of disinfectant injections to cure the virus.It may well be time for Scotland to erge from the UK Government in easing the lockdown in the immediate future. I trust that the Scottish Government will take dficult decisions based on the science available and for the welfare of the people. I have no such confidence in Mr Johnson or his amoral colleagues and advisers.Owen Kelly, Stirling.THE SNPs Commons leader, Ian Blackford, was arguably correct to criticise Boris Johnson for missing five Cobra meetings earlier in the year. What therefore will be his response to Nicola Sturgeon missing six such meetings in January and February She seemingly felt it more important to be playing netball or popping into a primary school ndash all self-publicised on social media. Ms Sturgeons spokesperson complains she sometimes doesnt have much notice of the crucial meetings. Ms Sturgeon: more than , people have died from Covid- so far across the world ndashworth some last minute diary rearrangement Martin Redfern, Edinburgh EH.NICOLA Sturgeon made it clear in the days leading up to last Thursdays press briefing that she would not be able to publish definite times and details about Scotlands journey out of lockdown, and I am sure that none of the grown-ups Ms Sturgeon was addressing expected her to suddenly pull up the shutters on our shops and and open all the pubs.I must disagree with Allan Thompsonwhen he accuses Ms Sturgeon of talking a lot but saying nothing. She made it clear that any steps which would be taken would be small and tentative, and that she was not going to take chances with the lives and health of Scotlands people. She did say that possible initiatives might allow some pupils toto school, in a safe and phased way, and that some businesses might be allowed to re-openthey could guarantee the two-metres-apart rule. The First Minister also urged people to read Coronavirus : Framework for Decision Making which is on the Scottish Government Website, and sets out the approach which will guide Ms Sturgeon and her governments decisions on transitioning out of lockdown.In opening this conversation with the public, Ms Sturgeon offered us all some hope, and the prospect of a light at the end of a very dark tunnel.Ruth Marr, Stirling.DIED \"with\" Covid-, or died \"of from due to\" it  I am getting confused.Until recently I thought the dference was made clear by the adage that more men die with prostate cancer than of it, and that sloppy reporting in the media was to blame for the blurring of the line.But now it appears the health authorities themselves, and not only in the UK, have questions to answer their political masters too.For example, the White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator has admitted to counting deaths as Covid- that really had other causes: ldquoIf someone dies with Covid-, we are counting that as a Covid- death. Which means the number of those really dying of it is much lower.So why the trashing of our economy through this excessive lockdown  Sweden has  per cent fewer deaths per million than the UK, despite its light-touch measures. Is our Government perhaps on a power high, enjoying curtailing civil liberties such as being out without \"reasonable excuse\", while some of their class have been rumbled ignoring the instruction In the winter of  , England alone lost , people to the flu, yet neither the Government nor the media batted an eyelid. All businesses and shops remained open, as did schools, restaurants, charities, churches, parks, and everywhere .If Westminster and Holyrood persist with their stubborn, inflexible diktats, the long-term effect on public health will be far worse than the virus. Only a healthy economy can finance a sound NHS.George Morton, Rosyth.WHILST accepting the requirement to adhere to the guidelines in order to keep us safe from this horric virus, I must point out the serious and obvious inconsistencies emanating from Government with regard to those guidelines.For instance, prior to the lockdown, it was possible to play golf in wide open spaces in the fresh air and it was easy to adhere to the social distancing and yet, at the time of writing, golf courses are closed I have just visited our local BQ store, which is open to the public with adherence to social distancing measures and this obviously involved shopping in an enclosed area which, with due care, presented absolutely no problem at all.There are many other examples of such inconsistency which the Governmentsfail to recognise and this is not conducive to good mental health with such unnecessary and illogical confinement being forced upon us.Unless and until good common-sense prevails, I fear that we could be heading towards civil unrest and disobedience on a major scale. Are you listening, Nicola Sturgeon James F McGilvray, Edinburgh EH.I FULLY understand, and completely accept, the need for the ongoing lockdown, and I follow all the rules as set out by the Scottish Government.But there is no advice coming out of the Government other than \"stay home\" or lsquoself-isolatersquo, to protect our Health Service.After four weeks, even minor illnesses or irritations are becoming a major issue and there is no advice on how to deal with any of these. How can anyone deal with foot issues, dental problems, eye irritations or back painwe have no access to chiropodists, dental practitioners, opticians or chiropractors because they are not allowed to go about their normal businesses  With very little access to our GPs, and the pharmacist no longer in a position to offer helpful advice or remedies, how are we expected to cope with worsening \"minor\" health problems These are issues that need to be addressed in the very near term, and with a high degree of urgency, or the lock down is going to lead to an epidemic of illnesses that need not have developedproperly treated.We need targeted advice and help.Francis Deigman, Erskine.TO all those whinging about the economic damage being caused by the Covid- shutdown: maybe, just maybe,we hadnt made the economy take first and foremost priority over everything  in our lives, we wouldnt be in the current mess were in right now Previous generations can plead ignorance, but ndash especially after recent \"near misses\" with HN and SARS ndash in an age of mass literacy and the internet, for these events to happen on our generations watch is unforgivable.When all this is over,once more we place \"the economy\" ndash the omnipotent god of the godless ndash on the highest pedestal exalted and above all other considerations, cutting corners and turning blind eyes to risks for the sake of \"the \", well deserve a worse pandemic than this with bells on.Mark Boyle, Johnstone.NEW Zealanders shared the UKs relief when Prime Minister Johnson came out of intensive care, and we were proud when he singled out a Kiwi nurse, Jenny, and her Portuguese colleague, Luiacutes, for their skill and dedication. The New Zealand health system has many fine nurses who would like the experience of working with the NHS in Scotland, where, like my daughter, they have family links.The irony of Mr Johnsonrsquos heartfelt praise is that the UKs nurse registration requirements are so tough as to put off many qualied and experienced Kiwi nurses from even trying.The application fee of NZ is a monthrsquos salary the language test is notorious for failing even those who communicate very well in their native English and the practical competency test must be taken in the UK. As a result, the NHS has missed out on many fine Jennys. Other countries, including the Republic of Ireland, are more welcoming. A change in the UKrsquos system would be a fine thing to come from this tragic pandemic.Dr Richard Gordon, Christchurch, New Zealand.Read more: Letters: Government must focus on care homes to help bring us out of lockdown"},{"url":null,"title":"richard-leonard-not-time-tinkering-around-edges","story":"The lockdown has forced some rethinking about public health, but also about the economy. The first budget from the new Chancellor Rishi Sunak was awash with borrowing and spending promises that would have been considered heretical by the Tories mere months previously. Beyond that, state intervention in the economy, abhorred by the Tories at Westminster and used as a begrudging last resort by the SNP at Holyrood has ed. For too long the economic strategy of UK and Scottish governments has been confined to a narrow, market-orientated horizon. The scale of this crisis and the threat it poses to the livelihoods of so many demands that this horizon is rethought. This is not a time for tinkering around the edges - this is a time for real change.Last week the Scottish Government published their ldquoState of the Economy report. According to the report the Scottish economy will face a collapse in output of some  per cent, a crash unparalleled in recent history and twice that inflicted by the  financial crisis. The week before the Office for Budget Responsibility warned that UK GDP will drop by  per cent and unemployment could rise by two million by the summer. This should leave no one under any illusion about the scale of the challenge we face.So while emergency relief for businesses and workers is welcome, we also need an economic plan as part of a new social contract with trade unions and employers. The last few weeks have shown the potential for change, the importance of co-operation but also the deep-seated inequalities which are a feature of our economy. Which is why restarting the old economy and relying on the market just will not work. Returning to the old ways of working, the old injustices, the old unfair distribution of economic power and prosperity, the old balance between the public and the private sector, and the old employment insecurities cannot form the foundations of the new economics we need to build.The magnitude of the change required is huge but it is the only way to restore economic confidence. In practical terms it means understanding that manufacturing is critical and greater self-sufficiency in a more erse economy is essential. The PPE crisis is just one reminder of why this matters. It means an extended role for local government in the direct provision of services like care for the elderly, and new investment in the pay and conditions of those whho provide it. That means an end to austerity, and radical new thinking like the creation of a Scottish Care Service to go along with a fully funded National Health Service. Across the public sector we must see procurement used for community wealth building, rather than to fuel the profits of a few global corporations. It means a signicant increase in the resources of the Scottish National Investment Bank as part of a wider industrial strategy to grow indigenous businesses, not as part of a case by case rescue service, or simply in response to market failure, but as part of a proactive way of working with unions and employers in the planned development of our economic base. It means harnessing the expertise in our higher and further education institutions, but it means harnessing the expertise of workers in the workplace too in new forms of economic democracy. And it means a new spirit of determination after the lockdown to re-prioritise workersrsquo rights, health and safety at work, end the low pay long working hours culture, stamp out zero- hours contracts and the gig economy and to apply solutions which reduce our carbon emissions.With interest rates now at a record low, monetary policy has run out of road. The Fiscal Commission has stated it is incredibly dficult to forecast weeks ahead, let alone years. But what is certain is that we cannot afford another decade of austerity and that will mean exploring options like a wealth tax and taking much tougher action to clampdown on the current industrial scale of tax avoidance and evasion.Active state intervention is needed to support ailing companies and provide a helping hand to workers in times of trouble. As time wares on it will become necessary for government to take a leading role in re-structuring our economy alongside business and trade unions. Economic planning is going to be essentialwe are to restart and reform our economy, and to tackle inefficiency, waste and exploitation.We will get through this crisis. But we must ensure we get through this together and no one is left behind."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-volunteer-group-feldy-roo-brings-birthday-cheer-isolating-pensioner","story":"The pensioner is one of thousands during lockdown who has also been helped by daily meal deliveries from Perthshire community group Feldy-Roo.Mrs Warren is one of many brilliant characters on their rounds and the Feldy-Roo delivery team presented her with a card signed by all the team with a box of chocolates.

Nor yet do I yearn to feel a stf breeze around my Cairngorms. But it seems there are those with no such qualms, folk who traipse hither and also yon, letting it all hang out.According to the latest intelligence, the number of folk joining British Naturism, the nudie body representing nudie bodies, has risen by  per cent since the coronavirus lockdown began.With their brains boiling in the recent hot weather, normally upright ratepayers have apparently taken to stoating aboot their gardens in the scud, and have now acquired a taste for the peculiar practice.In a discombobulating development, therersquos even to be a World Naked Gardening Day on May . You just have to hope theyrsquoll be careful with their secateurs when approaching folkrsquos sprinklers.The new development has caused alarm among influential sectors of British society. In an editorial, the Daily Star newspaper thundered: ldquoBlimey. What is this reserved country coming to That is a good question, well put. The paper says, correctly, that naturism conjures images of old men playing tennis and volleyball, but adds that this seems set to change.If that is indeed the case, Irsquod be worried about the younger, er, members. These tend to have minds of their own.Still, live and let live and all that. Naturism has quite a venerable history by now. Its origins are usually traced to the Fellowship of the Naked Trust, founded in India in  by an English civil servant attached to the British Raj. And they say no good came of the Empire.Back in Blighty, the movement proved particularly popular with ldquoalternative folk, such as socialists who believed in sharing their assets, and vegetarians not averse to displaying their meat and two veg.Despite that, naturism has long had a reputation for being cranky ndash it is popular in Germany, for example ndash and,you would care to peruse your subscription copy of Health and Efficiency magazine, you will see that it does not attract many supermodels.All the same, you would think it might still attract the wrong sorts, people with ulterior motives. However, these tend to be easily exposed.To be frank,we have more hot weather and further lockdowns, I am concerned that the British people will truly go doolally. I can picture scenes of our newly authoritarian police orices chasing wide-eyed, wobbly-bellied, naked people down the street. Not orices. Officers. Jeezus.My own feeling is that naturism, as with other weird cult activities such as cycling and jogging, is all very well as long as it is practised in the privacy of onersquos own home.I, for one, have no wish ever to see naked old men pinging their dead rubbers at tennis or, worse still, asking folk to pump up their deflated volleyballs.Never knowingly understoodPOOR old John Lewis.

Er, this news just in: No. They. Wouldnrsquot. Stop talking tripe.John Lewis lost it years ago, becoming too expensive, too geared towards the waxed jacket brigade, too complacent, and too much about coffee.Nobody even knows what its daft, dated motto ldquonever knowingly undersold even means any more and, when they put it through Google translate , they find that, particularly in these days of online shopping, itrsquos utterly meaningless anyway.The internut is awash with folk highlighting items that can be bought much cheaper where. As with its self-consciously snooty sister, Waitrose ndash where your normally expected shopping of  quid turns out nearer  ndash in John Lewis some of the prices are eye-watering.Last time I was there, the price tags on designer duds in the menrsquos clothing department made me giddy. And Irsquom a man renowned for self-control and sobriety.There was a time when John Lewis represented the epitome of British civilisation. It was accessible to all, a pleasant place full of quality items, staffed by polite, contented assistants.It can be the same again.

With evocative names such as Englishmanrsquos Skelly, Kneestone, Tullyboth Craigs and Lochaber Rock, without the lightshiprsquos protective forces, they could easily rip the hull of a passing vessel and leave it for dead.After more than half a century of serving the seas, new systems of protecting those at sea saw her light dimmed and her horn silenced.Now, although a little rusty andwith her red paint faded as she sits in Victoria Dock at City Quay, Dundee, the North Carr Lightvessel is on the brink of a new chapter.Recently, for the first time in about four decades, a bright light againshone from her defunct lantern towerndash a dazzling blue LED beam specially fitted to pay tribute to frontline workers, from NHS to mariners bringing food and goods across the seas.As well as a shining beacon of support, the light has heralded a new era that is set to see the North Carr Lightvessel undergo extensive repairs and refurbishment to eventually take her place alongside RR Discovery and HMS Unicorn as another of Dundeersquos seafaring tourist attractions.A major project is underway to see the former Northern Lighthouse Board vessel lovingly restored, while at the same time offering work experience and training to people with a range of disabilities and social challenges.Once at risk of being lost for good, she will eventually be put to work once again, providing a focal point as a community hub and training school of waterborne activities.According to lighthouses historian Peter Gellatly, who volunteers with Dundee-based charity Taymarra, which is behind the lightshiprsquos restoration, the project will ensure the last vessel of its kind in Scotland can shine again.ldquoWe are a nation of rich maritime history, and this ship is part of that heritage, he said. ldquoShe was built in Glasgow when the city was a main shipbuilding hub, she was part ofa lighthouse service that is second to none and is a link in that chain of important maritime heritage.ldquoIt would have been such a shame she had been lost and to have the opportunity to stop her deteriorating and maintain her for future generations to visit and learn from is really important.Built in  by A  J Inglis Ltd at Pointhouse Shipyard, at the spot where the River Clyde and Kelvin meet, she measured ft inand ft in breadth with the name lsquoNorth Carrrsquo painted in brilliant white across her red hull.One of just two vessels of her type at the time, ndash the Abertay lightship was the other ndash she took up her position inthe Forth close to the turning point for ships coming from the north and bound for the Tay, or from the south heading for open water.Her position was crucial for many years the North Carr Rocks had claimed vessel after vessel.

strategy Test, track and trace means testing people for coronavirus, tracking the spread of the virus, then tracing the people an infected person has come into contact with.If someone tests positive, they will then need to isolate for at least seven days, while high-risk contacts could be asked to self-isolate.ndash How will it help combat the spread of the virus Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said the strategy could help to suppress the transmission of Covid- in a way that then allows less stringent rules.:What coronavirus restrictions are in place around the world But Mr Hancock has also said that coronavirus cases need to drop substantially before the next phase of isolating infected people and their contacts can be truly effective.The theory is that once lockdown measures have reduced the infection rate, it will be easier to use the test, track and trace approach to keep track of new cases.ndash What is the first stage Crucially, people will first need to knowthey have coronavirus.The Government has pledged to carry out , tests a day by the end of April, and has widened the eligibility criteria to include all key workers.The only tests currently available check whether a person has coronavirus by looking for antigens.They do not show whether a person has previously had the virus, as reliable antibody tests have yet to be found.ndash What happens next The Government wants to track Covid- in the population to try to understand the current rate of infection alongside how many people have developed antibodies to the virus.Mr Hancock said , people will take part in the first phase of a large-scale testing study, with plans to expand it to up to , over the next  months.For the study, initial findings from which are expected in early May, all participants will be tested to seethey currently have coronavirus, while adults in , of the households will provide blood samples to find out what proportion of the population has developed antibodies.Once someone has tested positive, contact tracing will be essential to slow the spread.ndash What is contact tracing Contact tracing is the process of reducing virus transmission by identying and alerting people who may have been exposed so that they can protect themselves and others around them.Once someone has tested positive for coronavirus, clinicians will gather information about places they have visited and people they have been in contact with to get a detailed picture of who might be at risk of infection.People could be asked to self-isolatethey are at a higher risk of infection, PHE added.ndash How is this being rolled out To help with contact tracing, , people are now being recruited who will help noty those who have come in contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus.An NHS app is currently being developed which could identy people who have been in proximity to a smartphone user who subsequently develops coronavirus symptoms and tell them to self-isolate.ndash How will the app work Using Bluetooth Low Energy signals, the app will log each time it comes into close range of other devices also running the app.The app keeps an anonymous record of all these logs securely on a userrsquos phone.:Members of public to get chance to ask question at No  daily press conferenceIf someone develops symptoms of Covid-, they can use the app to inform the NHS, which will then trigger an anonymous alert to any other app users the infected person came into contact with by analysing the collected logs.The app will then advise what action to take, including telling people to self-isolatenecessary.ndash When is the NHS app expected to be released A date for the apprsquos release has not been confirmed and it remains in the development and

However, he urged the Justice Secretary to reflect on what was happening in England and Wales, where court services were making use of telephone, video and other technology to allow remote hearings and procedural business to take place.Kirkwall Sherf Court has been closed due to the coronavirus crisis, with emergency business transferred to a ‘hub’ in Inverness. However, concerns have been raised about the impact of this transfer, as well as obstacles in the way of securing new ship orders and Powers of Attorney.The Justice Secretary acknowledged these concerns, and offered to pursue the issue with the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service.Mr McArthur said: “Nothing is ‘business as usual’ at the moment, and the well-being of court staff and the wider public has to be the number one priority.  However, there are many aspects of civil court business that we cannot afford to put on pause.“Over recent weeks, I have been contacted by local solicitors in Orkney, extremely concerned at the dficulties they have faced in getting urgent business completed.  Delays in getting a new ship Orders or Powers of Attorney in place, for example, can have serious consequences. Vulnerable people rely on effective and timely court processes that make sure their rights are properly safeguarded.“In England and Wales we are seeing technology being used to enable more court business to be undertaken. There is no reason why a similar approach cannot be adopted in Scotland.  Indeed, Sherf Courts already conduct procedural hearings by tele-conferencing.“The justice secretary insists that progress is being made, but has offered to take up these concerns with the Scottish Court and Tribunals Service.

When asked about whether certain regions of Scotland might undergo a more localised approach, the First Minister said she wasn#t ruling out anything that might help us deal with the virus.#Today I am seeking to start a grown up conversation with the public about the complex decisions that lie ahead of us as we look beyond lockdown,# she said.“As we have done all along, we will seek to inform the public with the best scientic advice possible, but the science will never be exact and we are in uncharted territory so we also need to make careful judgements and be prepared to adapt and change course as we go.“We want to ease restrictions, but we cannot rule out having to reapply them should the virus run out of control.#Nicola Sturgeon said she and her colleagues would be relying on the latest data to inform them of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing.“Every day we see evidence that this virus causes real harm, but so too do the lockdown measures we are taking to contain it,# she continued.#This is causing harm to the economy and living standards, to children’s education and to mental health and wellbeing.“That is why we need to try to find a better balance than the one we have now, but as we do so we cannot take our eye off the need to suppress the virus and minimise the damage it does.“It is only when we are sure the virus is under control that we can even start to ease any of the restrictions because the virus will not have gone away.#Nicola Sturgeon has advised everyone to take part in the conversation about how we might leave lockdown.

Until late last year, a suitable vessel proved dficult to source, said the council.It then became known that the Nordic Sea, which operated on a number of passenger routes in the far north of Norway, had become available.Following visits and sea trials involving Orkney Marine Services and Orkney Ferries staff, the vessel was considered as a suitable replacement for the Golden Mariana.As the Nordic Sea was operating under a Norwegian Passenger Certicate, it was known that a number of requirements would have to be met before she was considered ready for a UK passenger certicate.With surveys now completed and a works list developed, the decision to complete the purchase was made and the vessel departed Bergen for Orkney yesterday morning, Thursday.On arrival, the vessel was handed over to Orkney Islands Council, but due to Covid- restrictions and the need for some works to be carried out to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication, it will be a while yet before the residents of Papa Westray are able to benefit from their new passenger ferry.The purchase of the new vessel was part funded by the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland.More details in The Orcadian Marine Scene section next week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

For urban wildle, which includes mammals and birds living alongside people in towns, this will affect levels of disturbance from humans and food availability.In recent weeks there have already been reports of animals adapting to the reduced human activity including Kashmiri goats roaming around Llandudno, North Wales, troops of monkeys in Singapore, wild boars in cities across Europe and Coyotes wandering streets during daylight hours in the US.Lead researcher Professor Dawn Scott, an expert in Mammal Ecology and Conservation, will use this unprecedented time to try to collect information and answer the study’s overarching question # How have urban animals responded to changes in human activity during the COVID- lockdown The research will collect records on any observations of unusual animal behaviour during the lockdown, determine the effects of reduction in human activity in city and town centres on urban wildle, and the effects increased human activity in gardens and outdoors space is having. The data from the survey will then be combined with other data from media searches to produce a report on the response of urban animals to lockdown across the globe.Professor Scott, head of the School of Le Sciences at Keele University, said: “Urban animals have been able to adapt to our landscape and live alongside towns, cities and suburbs so we know they are already highly adaptable. This flexibility in behaviour means they can usually quickly respond to changing conditions, including the absence of humans, which is happening during the lockdown.“Across the world we have seen reports of animals roaming cities and in locations that they wouldn’t normally be seen during the day. Social isolation is an opportunity for many to learn more about nature and how we can support it. We’re asking people to take part in our study and help us discover how urban animals are responding due to our change in behaviour.”To find out more and take part in the study visit: www.keele.ac.uk wildlestudycopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years.

It almost makes a case for education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!Reading it helped me to reflect on how dangerous it is for us to accept a narrow and rigid definition of what makes for a permissible #Shetlander#,and how important it is to reject the idea that some are entitled to more of a voice in that discussion than others.Those wishing to contest the need for such points to be made should first read Malcolm#s recommended article and then reflect on how recently a SMUHA squad featured a black-faced member of the NHS.As the article points out there is a prospect that this visus will not lead to more harmonious societies.The price of the peaceful cooperation we should wish for with all our neighboursis vigilance against those who would needlessly turn us against each other.Ilove how Peter and Malcolm appear to be so in veneration of each other, just a tad too preachy for me. As for #an education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!# I would respectfully suggest a basis eduction in the STEM subjects would be of far more value to humankind. That way most would understand what a virus is, how a vaccine works. The sort of simple science stuff that lives depend on.Humanities educated, Like Boris Johson and Rees Mogg. Go for it, Peter!One hesitates to perturb so a warm a socialist embrace. However, re the linked article, any author who discusses Nazism and bigotry in one breath and then Trump, Bolsonaro and Modi in the next while omitting to mention China’s Xi Jinping or the North Korean monster, Kim Jong-un, is clearly peddling a dishonest agenda.It#s a wonder people #educated in the humanities# didn#t see that. Interesting.Having installed himself as president for le, Xi is reportedly responsible for the most appalling, vicious repression and imprisonment of a million Uighur people and the relentless destruction of their culture in China’s Xinjiang province. The “ View” is clear: “Speak out or be complicit.”“Without sustained pressure, the grotesque human rights abuses seen in Xinjiang will not just continue but intensy. The time to speak up arrived long ago. Countries should be shouting about this from the rooftops.”If you want a chilling reminder of Nazism, guys, look no further.Does anyone want to remind John the NHS is socialist in intent and inception Did he learnall this from the wonderful British Empire ,I wonder, so ,he is a poor apprentice.John Tulloch#s unwillingness to engage with the main points previously made is unsurprising.Have I missed something here  An article about testing equipment arriving in Shetland allowing results to be available in hours rather than days has very quickly turned into a debate about immigrants, racism, humanities -v- STEM Education and extreme left right wing politics. It’s not always necessary to find something to disagree about.@Stephen Johnston, I agree. That#s precisely why I hadn’t commented on any coronavirus item, here or where, until my above post. The coronavirus pandemic is a rapidly unfolding tragedy, a national and global emergency. Using it as a political football is completely inappropriate.However, there comes a point when people pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, endlessly stirring the pot of social ision and bitterness, must be challenged. Ideally, we would support those faced with tackling the crisis # at all levels # and keep our criticisms constructive. Or keep quiet and let them get on with it. Lessons can be learned later, with the benefit of hindsight, once all the facts are knownAs they say, # you won#t help, at least, get out of the way.#JT, straight from the right wing playbook# Tell them to be quiet. It#s an effective way to silence people # who could disagree that the coronavirus is a terrible tragedy after all  But#JT, How is the racism suffered every day for thousands of NHS staff not up for discussion  Why do you wish to silence that discussion Why don#t you deal with issue, rather than making a series of accusations and personal attacks What facts about racism faced by NHS staff are not known  Maybe not known to you, but lived by the people in the poem. Maybe for you racism and anti-immigrant sentiment is a political football to be put away until you see fit. But for the people who have lived with it through their lives, suffered because of it, it is a matter of day to day struggle. And yes, a political issue.When John declared that “People pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, must be challenged” I assumed that he was going to say something about Dr Mr Lt.Cdr Tinkler.For what it’s worth John, my own qualications are an HGV and PSV licence sothat’s what you regard as a superior education, you must have the mother of all inferiority complexes.Whenever anyone tries to bring up subjects like racism or social exclusion on this forum, the same few iniduals fly into an apoplectic rage and you, John, are always one of them.As someone once said:“If you won’t help, at least, get out of the way.”Malcolm Henry Johnson, O dear me, that chip on the shoulder. It was actually Surgeon Lieutenant Commander with  years training in Nuclear, Biological and ChemicalWarfare including triage and casualty care. I rejoice I never had time to waste on the humanities, more important work to do, like keeping people breathing.I know, tell me about it Ian. I for one would be fine without HGV drivers. In fact, I have been training our blessed grandson on how to handle a mule and cart . On a side note, I was exposed to radiation as a child in the s. The triage nurse was excellent and the radiation never did me any harm. So what I am saying is you are both valued by old John Thomas.I’ve often pondered the nature of predictability and wondered: What came first, the Surgeon Lieutenant Commander or the wind-up, clockwork toy To Peter Hamilton and John Thomas I say, thank you, for exemplying my point about using the coronavirus tragedy as a political football. Perfect.I hadn#t commented about NHS or care home staff. However, relatives of mine are currently benefitting from their work and their courage and conviction is truly admirable. Whatever their race or nationality, I heartily applaud it.Call me what you like. I won#t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic#Punch and Judy# food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. I invite readers to check my above points and judge for themselves.Have a nice day, boys.JT:#I won’t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic “Punch and Judy” food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. ##pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments,#Pot meet kettle.

Engaging your in debate is not an attack. Calling people who you disagree with pompous might have been though.Inspiring attempts at deflection from John Tulloch.

As founder of Wir Shetland#s UKIP, John is something of a past master when it comes to #stirring the pot of social ision and bitterness#, but we aren#t allowed to talk about that, about the complex nature or history of racism in Shetland, or anything closer to home than China it seems.Inconveniently for John though, lessons can be, and are being, learned now.These are hard times, but hard times are good times to imagine how things can and should be made better.#Now You Clap For Me# had something powerful to say.John Tulloch, however, remains somehow both vocal, but as yet, completely disengaged.A rising chorus of #Shetland for the Shets# might refocus him,anyone is feeling creative enough to write it. It goes to the tune of #We shall overcome#.I most say that over the years I’ve never been one to comment on any stories here or where on news items, but holy hell Shetland Times , what are you doing Mr Editor or moderator  A whole positive story totally hijacked by the same, apparently educated peoplethat plaster your letters, any and all topics, with the same diatribe time and time again !Argumentative boys should really just take their handbags, go to the play park and dance around them, after the lockdown is lted of course !Well done Shetland NHS for all you do for us and all that you endeavour to do to help keep us safe and healthy !!You tell them Steven! 😉Was Carmichael right to call the government#s approach ideological  Who cares  There is no room for politics in any of this.

When the tide was out, it was a grey-sanded, multi-rockpooled, playground.The entire village could be found there on a summer’s weekendwhen it appeared that everything celestial had aligned just perfectly.Hang on, rose-tinted glasses being fetched.We changed into our trunks behind towels held up by impatient fathers, determined themselves to let the sun shine, however briefly, on pale skin that hid, perennially, under jumpers and boiler-suits, the unorm of the tweed-mill and croft.Our young horizons were beginning to broaden and, like every islander before us, the sea needed to be properly introduced.These were the halcyon, formative, summer days of my youth and I was a veritable Jacques Cousteau in black, knee-, wellies.We overturned large pebbles and boulders in the pools, discovering quickly the habits of their occupants and that the miniature world, whilst of huge interest and education, was but a microcosm of what lay beyond the surf crashing not too far away with its warning roar.It was a gentle build up to boldness.We were relatively safe and required little, or no, supervision: the worst that could happen to us was a graze from a slip on the rocks, or a nip from a, larger than was wise to attempt to corner, portainn .We learned which fish were ‘horned’ or awkward to handle and delighted ourselves when we managed to capture one in our hands.Everything was done with your pals.Some of us were more adept than others at this new ‘sport’ a lack of fear, and possibly consequences, proving hugely advantageous when it came to the ‘hunt’.We broke open winkles and limpets on the rocks and threw them, defenceless, into the bigger pools and waited and watched.We experimented and we learned.We filled jars and tin cans, wandered home with our capture, and learned the dference between salt and seawater when it came to aquatic le.Usually several days later from the smell in the shed.At the time it seemed like simply harmless fun, but it was just what generations previous had done before us, and it was preparing us for the serious business ahead.The menfolk of the village all had a bamboo pole which they used to fish ‘properly’ with. The trick was to keep it wet so it wouldn’t get brittle and crack, hence the best place for hiding, and protecting, it was usually in the waterone.You might have had some guttering, we had several waterones.The post office at Knock was the place from which to procure such an item and, yes, they did them in miniature sizes too.I watched in awe as my father rigged my first ‘bamboo’.Half-way up the pole he tightly bound one end of theof tarred sisal twine that he had precisely cut just below a protruding culm .The twine was then wound around the narrowing bamboo to the fragile tip.The tip needed to be light and flexible, for casting and for ‘feel’, but strong enough not to break under the weight of anything with scales or fins.He then expertly tied off a secure fastening at this apex, leaving a working portion of twine which was brought back down the pole and loosely bound.We were, I was told in Gaelic, ‘good to go’.‘Look after it !’, I was warned.Of course we weren’t allowed, immediately, to go to ‘the rocks’ on our own: there had to be some kind of schooling before we were let loose where the big fish swam andyou fell in you’d almost certainly drown.These were the early seventies in Lewis, and the only things that knew how to swim were the creatures that you so desperately wanted to catch.We were taken, yet again, to Shinigeadh where, when the tide was full, we had our very own ‘training pond’, full of cuddies, desperate to hit the frying pan.The bodach had attached a hook to the end of the twine with about a yard of monofilament and had spent low tide filling a bag with some bàirnich , which I’m pretty sure we referred to as maoraich .The walk down to the geo, proudly behind my father and uncle , rod over my shoulder, made me proud as punch.In hindsight, yes it was a graduation.Naturally it was a beautul summer’s evening , the sun was behind us and, despite the bay being filled with grey sand, the sea seemed blue-transparent and I swear I can remember seeing the fish shoaling and darting about, ready to tease us with nibbles and tugs, each one magnied to the size of something huge.Possibly a mackerel Plucking a limpet from the bag, my father swtly extracted it from the shell with a squeeze of the thumb.He tore off the working anatomy, the gastronomic bits of the gastropoda, and popped the rest into his mouth and chewed.Not for long just enough to soften the muscular foot of the newly despatched mollusc so that it could easily be stuck onto the end of my waiting hook.It was the one ‘trick’ that I was never to repeat.I was told about the dangers of fishing too close together , the dangers of standing too close together , the dangers of waving a rod around , the dangers of getting too close to the sea .There were dangers from wet rocks , danger from extracting a fish, no matter the size, from a hook when it was thrashing around, determined toto terra-fliuch , and danger, generally, from not paying full attention, at all times, to what was going on around me.Maybe not all at the same time, but, as the night progressed, and my schoolboy enthusiasm spectacularly combined with my schoolboy errors to make repetition often and necessary, I quickly realised that to mistake ‘playing’ with ‘fishing’ could have serious consequences indeed.I was, however, undoubtedly ’hooked’.From the moment that first vibration was transmitted from fish to fingers.I’ve often wondered about heredity and whether or not certain traits get handed down from previous generations.I’m certain that in many cases they do.But we all, certainly most boys of my generation, grew up with the hand-me-down skills of our fathers and grandfathers.I never met my father’s father, the original ‘Tomsh’.He died before I was born.As a long-line fisherman working out of Portnaguran, his was very definitely not the easiest of lives.The photographer James McGeogh, a former Glasgow policeman, married the daughter of his next-door-neighbour.He is well known for his stunning photographs of the guga hunters of Ness.He found time as well to capture many other images of ‘s Lewis, including one of my grandfather in his working gear.‘Tomsh’ here was the same age in it as I am now.Check out the missing digits on his left hand.Not that I would have ever dared to answer my father back, or not pay attention to his instructions at the rocks: but looking at that picture of his father, I’m pretty sure I know why the message stuck.We all had to start somewhere.I think I managed around a half-dozen cuddies that night.Though I had to get someone more experiencedto get these huge fish off my hook.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may

years ago on a beautul clear morning we were walking to the monastery on Eilean Chaluim Chille in the drained loch in front of Whitewave in Kilmuir.High up a plane flew over leaving a thick, white vapour trail, soon to be followed by another and another. I started counting them and by the time we reached the island, over  planes had flown across, each leaving a mark in the sky.The clear blue became hazy, and the afternoon never ed to the clarity of when we began our walk.These days in lockdown, as we experience this incredible weather we have the clarity which was lost that day.With few or no airliners flying over, the atmosphere seems sharper, brighter, and maybe pollution from industrial parts spreads worldwide and in the past, found its way over to us via jet streams and high air currents.This pollution seems now much reduced.The talk now is of exit strategies and how we end this lockdown. The term “other side” has been coined and was even used in last week’s very moving front page editorial.What will the other side look like There will be many in tough situations during lock down, and for many more the future will be uncertain, and much of the stress from that uncertainty will probably revolve around financial security.A new normal will have to emerge, and we might hope that it will be more sustainable, on all fronts, both locally and globally.Some say that it was Steve Jobs of Apple computers who turned wants into needs, and empires have been built in our commercial world by making desires into needs.There seem to be business models which require constant expansion or ‘biggering’, to use a phrase from the well-known Dr Suess’ children’s book ‘The Lorax’, which is warning of the consequence of continual industrial growth.It is always worth looking at nature, even when thinking of economy and industry.Diversity is healthy in the natural world, a healthy ecosystem has an element of sustainability, but within that system, things grow and die, and more importantly are eaten, nothing is wasted.Businesses will come and go, but the reliance on a single sector for a whole community could never be healthy.The tourists are unlikely to visit Skye in the numbers they have in the last few years, and perhaps never will again.There will be no ‘go’ button pressed after lock-down, and even next season is likely to be considerably quieter. We will have to learn to exist with the reduced numbers.There is risk in business, such is the way of it, and I suspect there was a perception that investing in tourism on Skye was a fairly reliable bet.Investing to meet the seemingly never-ending demand was something even banks might have been comfortable with. Looking back at the tourist season last year, maybe it just could not have continued growing and growing.Something had to give, it is just that nobody could have envisaged such a collapse, and for such a reason.Many of us are guilty of chasing the dollar, but is it for the dollars sake, is it for needs or wants, and what do we lose in the quest I used to joke about retiring to the city “where the pace of le is slower”. The cliché of getting a work le balance sorted is never more relevant.On my few travels into Portree, I have seen parents playing football with their children in their gardens. I have seen family groups taking their daily exercise, one group having a picnic on a small cnoc above the road, being together, enjoying time together.I have seen on social media, electricians proudly showing off their first loaf of bread, and a joiner with his first batch of home brew bottled.

River Lagan.  Driver Marty McFlynn, with Ryan O#Neill riding shotgun, are delivering food to homes across south Belfast from a distribution point in the grounds of the Good Shepherd Church on the Ormeau Road.Portia Msonza lives in the flats. Originally from Zimbabwe, she has lived in Belfast for  years.The mother of three children, aged from  to , who attend St Joseph#s on the Ravenhill Road and Holy Rosary on the Ormeau Road. Her -year-old daughter Chantelle is missing her friends, but they chat online.Portia appreciates the arrival of food and other items.She is waiting for her Universal Credit to kick in. She is an agency worker, so is not furloughed on pay.It will be another couple of weeks before Portia will get any money, but it will be a loan, she added. Then another five before the first Universal Credit payment comes through. Then she will have to pay back the loan with interest.It is really appreciated whatare doing, Portia said, adding that she is more worried about the people in her homelandthe virus takes hold in a country with a healthcare system not likely able to deal properly with the spread.The next stop is also in Annadale, a woman living on her own with serious underlying health conditions. She is confined to the house for  weeks on the advice of her doctor.Friends have come around to leave food and medication, and she has broadband.Her flat is a couple of doors down from a memorial topped with a flag of the red hand of Ulster. It remembers the fallen, but with no details about the conflict in which they served.There is no way a Rosario Youth Club bus would have ever been around here back in the day, says Marty. He later admitted that also back in the day, after the release of #Back to the Future#, he was fairly ribbed.Food and other items, including nappies, toilet roll, shampoo, are sent and brought in by local residents and companies, for distribution by members of Rosario Youth Club, Rosario Football Club, Bredagh GAC, the Ormeau Road Boxing Club and Rosetta Area Community Support.Minibuses leave the centre every day to deliver to elderly people in sheltered accommodation and to inidual residents, while boxes are also picked up by Homeplus, which helps the homeless, migrant workers and asylum seekers.This grassroots effort was set up entirely by the local community, says Stephen Haughey, manager of the Holy Rosary Parish Centre, the hub of the distribution.In total, approximately  parcels were either distributed directly by this ad hoc group, or by others such as Homeplus, over the last number of weeks.On Friday, local DUP councillor David Brooks landed down with a bag and an offer of any help.Just back from South Belfast Foodbank where superb work is being done by Stephen  the team, the councillor later tweeted.Marty said the service has expanded through word of mouth.We had about  people delivering to the first week, but it has gone mental, he said.Apart from Annadale, there were deliveries to the Cregagh estate, the Holylands and Stranmillis.It is a real community effort.

But Kit Adams said he feels more isolated on ing to a Northern Ireland that bears no resemblance to the one he left just a few months ago.When the Co Down man departed his native Newcastle for a stint as a postmaster at Port Lockroy in Antarctica, the main concern back home was the effect Brexit would have on the border between north and south.Now, however, the entire island is in lockdown due to the coronavirus epidemic and -year-old Kit, who came home at the end of March, told the Belfastthat it has been a challenge trying to adapt to the culture shock of post-Covid Northern Ireland.It#s strange, but in many respects I have stronger feelings of isolation back home in Co Down than I had when I was living in one of the least populated places on the planet, he said.Even in Antarctica, we actually had quite a few people coming and going.

It was warm, dry and there was lots of chocolate.The lack of normality he now faces at home is a bit strange, Kit explained.You go away and you come back with all these grand plans to go travelling or something... he said.And then I found myself in a not too dissimilar situation than I was in Antarctica.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseKit Adams FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappKit AdamsBut he certainly sounds happy enough.It#s really not that bad, Kit said. You can still get outside, you can go for a run, you can do ious forms of exercise that I just couldn#t do in Antarctica so in many ways it#s easier.When we were in Antarctica it was  days before two of us left the island for the first time.He added: There are more opportunities here at home - you can go for a run or a cycle. I suppose it#s what you make of it, really.Although Kit, who has a Master#s degree in polar and alpine change, initially said it would be tough to single out the best bit of his Antarctic adventure, he subsequently revealed one special memory which will be hard to surpass.We got to kayak around the island on Christmas Day which was pretty special, he said.It meant that we could see the island from a dferent perspective.Recalling a December  like no other during his stint at the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust#s post office, Kit said he did not even miss not getting the usual turkey dinner.There was a little bit of snow on Christmas morning, then it cleared and it was a real blue sky day, he said. We started cooking the Christmas dinner and we had an offer to borrow kayaks from a ship that was in the area so we borrowed those, put the Christmas cooking on hold, left it on the hob and went kayaking around the island.Not many people ever get up close and personal to the penguin population, but Kit can now be counted among their number.The chicks are inquisitive and would go into buildingsyou left doors open too long, he said.Some of the adults are a bit less friendly, and more protective. But they#re fantastically funny to watch I don#t think you could ever get bored watching them and we were literally surrounded by them the whole time.Four months in one of the world#s most remote locations must be hard to follow. Asked what#s next on the agenda, Kit replied: I really don#t know.You can have all these grand plans and ideas and then a virus throws a spanner in the works.I wanted to see some places that I#d never been before. Now I#m sorting through photographs from being away.Kit said he would love to go back to what must be one of the coolest destinations he has ever visited.We#ll see how thing span out for next November, he mused.The trust has said they#ll be choosing people who#ve been before to go back ... so I#ll possibly throw my hat into the ring.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfastis a member of IPSO and subscribes to its Editors Code of PracticeIpsoSitemapContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyPaid-for content PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsAn INM Websitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus ni schools unlikely to be reopened before september","story":"Schools in Northern Ireland will not reopen until September because ministers believe parents will not send their children back before the summer holidays FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappSchools in Northern Ireland will not reopen until September because ministers believe parents will not send their children back before the summer holidaysBy Staff ReporterApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailSchools in Northern Ireland will not reopen until September because ministers believe parents will not send their children back before the summer holidays.As speculation mounts that schools could reopen in June in Britain, a Stormont source told Sunday Le that fears over coronavirus would mean fewer than % of pupils here wouldto full-time educationthey were to reopen in the coming weeks.Detailed estimates show people are too afraid to send their children back so reopening schools before September would be pointless, the source insisted.In recent days there have been indications that schools where in the UK may reopen in late May or early June.

Hopes that the May  end date for the current restrictions will see an easing in the extraordinary limits on everyday le may be dashed amid continuing alarm at the numbers still catching the virus.It comes as  new cases of Covid- in the Republic were announced last night, along with an additional  deaths.In total , people have lost their lives and there have been , confirmed cases of coronavirus.As the outbreak and resulting public health regulations continue to wreak havoc on Irish society and the economy, senior Government sources played down the prospect of any major easing of restrictions next week.And the possibility remains that the strict rules, including the closure of non-essential shops as well as km limits on exercise and cocooning for the over-s, could all remain in place beyond Tuesday of next week.The volume of new cases and number of patients in intensive care units, the capacity of the health service to cope with any renewed surge, and a ramping up of testing and contact tracing are the key factors in any decision to roll back restrictions.One source said consideration is being given to not lting restrictions at all on May , orany measures are rolled back it would be very limited.While the number of people with coronavirus in ICUs was  as of Saturday night, down from a peak of , this is still considered too high.Decisions will be taken by the country#s National Public Health Emergency Team later this week on what restrictions,any, can be eased.After that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is due to set out the Government#s plan for a step-by-step approach to relaxing restrictions over the coming weeks.Sources said Mr Varadkar will outline the action plan for when restrictions can be eased without necessarily specying dates for certain measures. Rather it will be a roadmap of sorts for rolling back restrictions in phases at the appropriate time for each action.A source said the aim will be to provide more certainty to families and businesses for the weeks to come so that they can start to plan, but it won#t all be implemented on May .Measures under consideration for an easing of restrictions include letting over-s leave their homes to exercise as well as flexibility on the km limit for others going for walks or runs.Garden centres and DIY stores where social distancing can be carried out are seen as businesses that could reopen in early phases of relaxed restrictions.Childcare staff being allowed into the homes of healthcare workers is also being considered as an early measure.However, a source stressed that even smaller movements of people being permitted leads to a risk of the virus spreading and such measures are unlikely to be taken together in one go.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The fact that young children may be unable to describe other, less obvious symptoms can make the start of a cough even more worrying.But a cough doesn#t necessarily mean Covid-, of course. As well as being caused by other less serious respiratory illnesses such as a cold, a cough may be caused by asthma, which is diagnosed in around one in  children and, unlike other lung diseases, has a far higher incidence in children than in adults.But, as World Asthma Dayapproaches, how can you tell the dference between an asthma cough and a coronavirus cough  Here, the experts answer questions about spotting the dference.My child has started coughing - what should I do GP and respiratory expert Dr Noel Baxter, medical adviser at Asthma UK, says: If your child has a new cough or their cough is getting worse, you should contact your GP to get the right advice and find out what to do next. You shouldn#t try to diagnose your child on your own.What are the main dferences between an asthma cough and a Covid- one The Asthma Society of Irelandsays: The respiratory symptoms associated with Covid- are similar to asthma - shortness of breath, and cough. The symptom which dferentiates asthma from Covid- is experiencing a new fever. Fever is the symptom that has been most common of any symptom in confirmed cases of Covid-.Baxter adds: Are other people in the home having temperatures and coughs  This could be Covid-, but remember this could also be other bacterial or viral infections of the respiratory system that are still around at this time of year.If your child is having a cough because of asthma, they may also be wheezing. This is a faint whistling sound that comes from your child#s chest. The cough will tend to be dry with sometimes a small amount of pale yellow phlegm.My child already has asthma - how do I tellit#s causing her cough Baxter advises parents to look at their child#s written personal asthma action plan, made with their health care professional.This will refresh your memory about what your child#s asthma symptoms are normally like, he says.This is by far the best place to start. After the pandemic, this asthma action plan will continue to help you and your child whenever they get respiratory symptoms in the future.Covid-, just like any other winter cold virus, can trigger an asthma attack. This would be the most likely impact of Covid- in a child with asthma. That#s good news because we have rapidly effective treatments for an asthma attack, which will be detailed in your asthma action plan.Although this is less common, your child may have a cough because the Covid- virus has caused an airways infection, which includes the more serious situation of pneumonia. So, it#s possible to have an asthma cough and a Covid- cough at the same time.What normally triggers your child#s cough Baxter says parents of children who already have asthma should ascertain whether the child has been exposed to any of their usual asthma triggers.For example, did the cough start after walking through the park where the grass has just been mown, he asks.Are they being more exposed than usual to the air freshener in your home  Have they been stroking a cat  If the cough seems to be linked to any of their usual triggers, it#s more likely to be asthma.What does your child#s cough sound like It#s not easy for doctors to tell what#s causing a cough just by its sound.There are a few situations where we can, such as croup, which sounds like a loud barking noise. While doctors might get some clues, it#s quite hard to tell what#s causing the cough just by sound, explains Baxter.How long have they had the cough for Asthma coughs may develop over weeks, whereas with Covid-, the cough starts and gets worse in hours or days, not weeks, says Baxter. If your child has had an asthma attack before, you will probably remember that the cough tends to be worse in the morning and at night, he adds. This iation depending on the time of day is quite common with asthma. You wouldn#t expect this with the Covid- cough as much.What should I doI think my child#s cough is asthma Make an appointment with your GP. Also try to keep a diary of their symptoms and take it to the appointment, advises Baxter.Getting a confirmed asthma diagnosis for your child can be worrying for many parents, he adds. But your doctor will give you a personal action plan for your child. If your child takes their medicines regularly, goes for asthma reviews and uses the correct inhaler technique, they and you can feel confident that having asthma won#t hold them back from doing anything.Remember,your child is coughing or their asthma symptoms are worsening, make an urgent appointment to talk to your GP. Getting their symptoms under control cuts the risk of an asthma attack.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It would become an elaborate weave of evidence to prove why someone was south of the border and that they were stopped.All of those things would be essential proofs and it would become very burdensome to prove all of that.Health Minster Robin Swann also expressed concerns yesterday that people were beginning to become complacent in the fight against Covid-. He said there would be no timetable as to when we will begin to exit the lockdown strategy.I think it will encourage a greater sense of ease and complacencypeople think: #Well,it#ll be all right in two weeks so it#ll be all right today#, he told the BBC.Writing in today#s Belfast , Minister for the Cabinet Office in Westminster Michael Gove said that it is entirely understandable that people want to knowan end to the lockdown is in sight, but admitted the disease will be here for some time.Read MoreMichael Gove:Opinion Thanks to the people of NI for your continued efforts to keep us all safeTragically,  people in Northern Ireland have lost their lives to this invisible killer, and it is thanks to all your efforts that the figure is not higher still, said the Conservative MP.Only once we are reassured on our five key tests can we safely adjust the distancing regime: the NHS#s ability to cope a sustained fall in daily death rates reliable scientic data showing the infection rate falling to manageable levels sufficient testing capacity, and PPE to meet future demand.Elsewhere, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has dismissed calls for an early easing of the lockdown.He said the outbreak was still at a delicate and dangerous stage. He added: We need to make sure that the next steps are sure-footed, which is why we are proceeding very cautiously and we are sticking to the scientic advice.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The initiative came from a local councillor who wanted to honour the wonderful work Pat did, said Fr Boland. And it was a fitting way to honour him. Pat was the focus for a way to express our appreciation of the amazing work people are doing on the front line, and it was a cross-community initiative all over the Strabane area.Church of Ireland rector at Christ Church Rev John White said the fact all denominations had taken part was important.As it has often been said, this disease makes no distinction, said Rev White. This is a way we can identy with those in the front line, with those in the NHS, all the staff in hospitals and those in nursing homes. It isn#t much, but it is one way we can show that we are with them.Mr McManus#s niece Aileen Mullen told the BBC the gesture was a beautul thing to do to remember Pat.Mr McManus leaves behind his partner Lena, three sons and grandchildren.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mid Ulster councillor Darren Totten had been alerted to the nurses’ plight and set in place a train of events that would reveal a heart-warming tale of community spirit.

Four fellas landed and they were painting the living room and bedrooms. “One fella, who I had never met in my le, rang me and said ‘I’m here whenever you need’ so I told him to come on ahead. He landed with dust sheets, rollers, paint brushes and all the rest.  “Bradley’s furniture landed out with a lorry-load of furniture and kitted the whole thing out with brand new mattresses, beds, bedside lockers and all. “The smaller stuff was all made up from donations that people had given. Cloverhill Oil landed with  litres of heating oil and a local fella wired up the TV aerial free of charge.” Cllr Totten hailed the effort as a fine example of community cohesion and said the positivity had helped create a space for the healthcare staff to rest from the harrowing reality of Covid-.

The annual event was due to take place in venues across the city area next month but was cancelled due to COVID-. However, Council have instead put together a digital programme that will be broadcast as a live event on the City of Derry Jazz Festival Facebook each day from Thursday May th to Sunday May th - called the Virtual Jazz Festival…Sofa Sessions. People will be able to see and hear from their favourite bands and artists, as well as taking part in some jazz dance classes. googletag.cmd.push Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Michaela Boyle said the online festival will help lt spirits. There is always such a buzz around Derry and the whole district when the Jazz Festival rolls around every year and while we will unfortunately have to miss out on that this time, I think this is a brilliant way of recreating a bit of that excitement and atmosphere in our own homes. Theres nothing quite like a bit of toe-tapping and catchy music to lt your spirits and ease les anxieties, and this revised online programme gives us all something to look forward to – which is exactly what we all need right now – and with over  artists and bands taking part there will be something for everyone to enjoy. googletag.cmd.push I want to thank Councils Culture Department for their hard work in putting this programme together. Im certainly looking forward to a bit of jiving and singing! Jacqueline Whoriskey, Councils Festival  Events Manager, said they felt it was hugely important to keep the festival going, albeit in a dferent capacity. The Virtual Jazz Festival… Sofa Sessions is an opportunity to celebrate artists from our own district and from all over the world, and we felt that now, more than ever, it was imperative that we find a way to do that. In putting together the programme we have made sure that local artists are well represented in line with the ethos of the festival. Its a really tough time for them, and for all of the artists and bands involved, given the financial hit that they have had to endure in the past few months. This is the th year of the festival, and although it will certainly be much dferent to any that we have had before, we were determined that it would go ahead in some form, and we hope tobigger and better than ever on our th anniversary next year.

Council members and senior management have been meeting regularly to review impacts on Council services, with daily updates on the changing response to the COVID- situation. It was decided that given the ongoing situation and all the guidance from health authorities regarding public safety and the restrictions regarding public gatherings it would be prudent to cancel at this stage.Announcing the decision, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Michaela Boyle, said it was necessary to look ahead and be realistic about what events can safely be delivered over the coming months. I know this will be disappointing as these are both popular events and ones which positively promote health, wellbeing and fitness, she declared.But these are exceptional times and dficult decisions must be made for the greater good.Local people have been responding well to the social distancing advice and I know people will understand that under the current government guidelines regarding public gatherings, it would not be possible to host these events without making major changes to their format that would have a detrimental impact.By making these decisions at an early stage, we can avoid accumulating unnecessary costs and resourcing in terms of planning, and we will continue to review other major Council-led events over the coming weeks.We do however want to send out a strong message regarding exercise and its importance to both mental and physical health at this time. Council is promoting smaller exercise challenges – such as the Family Home k Run Walk on May  – and the online Friday Fitness Challenge, which people can do at home, in their garden or near their home. We will continue to explore other activities and programmes in the coming weeks which will enhance health and wellbeing and offer people the chance to exercise in a safe and fun way.Please take the opportunity to get together as a family and enjoy games and activities, and the extra time we are getting to spend with loved ones.The decision was taken by members during a virtual meeting this week where they were reminded that regulations set out by the Department of Health in their Coronavirus Legislation which came into operation on March  were still in place.The announcement follows on from the decision to cancel the City of Derry Jazz Festival and St Patricks Day programme in recent weeks. Council will continue to adhere to the requirements to keep premises and businesses closed, including burial grounds and cemeteries, and to adhere to the restrictions on movement and gatherings. However, it continues to explore alternative options for the public including the launch this week of an online Jazz Festival. The Virtual Jazz Festival… Sofa Sessions will be broadcast as a live event on the City of Derry Jazz Festival Facebook each day from Thursday May thto Sunday May th- called the Virtual Jazz Festival…Sofa Sessions.For more information on all the impacts on Council services in relation to COVID- please go to www derrystrabane  coronavirus googletag.cmd.push  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Fireside selectors picking teams is one of Ireland’s national past times. This selection is based on players who took part in county senior, intermediate and junior finals -. It is based on the grade they were playing at that time. Five from each is selected. Just like putting five litres into a one litre jar. Here goes...  - Antoacutein McMullan For years it was the ‘big boot’ in defence who would do the kicking out. Distance was important. Now it has developed into an art form with the qualities being, a cool head, the ability to kick the ball through basketball hoop at a distance of  metres, safe hands and cat like reflexesrequired. Antoacutein has all the credentials. googletag.cmd.push  - Oisin Duffy A good defender is one that the forward hates playing against and the energetic Duffy was one of those prize assets. Firm in the tackle, virtually impossible to stop on the run and full of scores from his defensive position. His display in the Ulster Intermediate championship against Magheracloone, where he scored - from play, was exceptional.  - Brendan Rogers No player can change gear as quickly as the tall Brendan when he motors out of defence. He would excel in any sport and could play anywhere on the football field. A brilliant hurler as well. Seeing a forward chasing him with tongue hanging out is something were are used to. A real pleasure to watch. googletag.cmd.push  - Karl McKaigueThere is a famous film called the Quiet Man. Karl could be titled the quiet marker in defence. He has snuffed out some of the best forwards in the game and still manages to slip forward and get a point or two. Tackles the ball and not the man, so he rarely gives away frees. His anticipation of where the ball is going to drop is exceptional.  - Niall KeenanA neat and tidy footballer. His build would suggest corner forward material but he is actually a quality defender. Came through the minor and U ranks showing class all the way. His display at Croke Park in the  minor semi-final for Derry marked him as a player with a great future and he has lived up to that billing.  - Joe Gray Play anywhere Joewas the heart beat of Faughanvale teams for the most of two decades. He led a young team from the junior ranks to a solid intermediate outfit. Played and managed at dferent times and had a few games with Derry in the s. Has all the skills and a read dead eye free taker.  - Jimmy O’Connor Jimmy was ‘spotted’ by an Derry U scout when he was closer to  than . Now, nearer  than , he keeps up an amazing standard of fitness. Normally listed as a corner forward he is let loose to conduce the orchestra. Not the biggest but he makes light of that with his wide range of skills.  - Enda Muldoon Could have played on any team, in any era. Great hands and a master of the ever accurate foot pass. Always made the game look easy since he broke into a Derry minor team in . Now a qualied coach, passing on his skills to the next generation the youngsters could not have had a better tutor. A gentleman on and off the field.  - Mark Lynch From enthralling Croke Park in the  All-Ireland minor final, at the age of , Mark has continued to show quality. Stepped down two years ago after a long inter county career. Still the heart and soul of Banagher teams. He was exceptional in their senior championship run last year and the intermediate title a year previous. In his all round skills is the mastery of free taking.  - Michael McNaughtGrandson of the great Mickey McNaught who was on the Derry  National League winning team. His accurate left foot is one of the reasons why the Waterside men have become a solid force in Derry football. Can play midfield or half forward and seldom is below par. A very accurate free taker.  - Richard KingRichard broke into the Wolfhound’s senior team at the age of  as a corner forward. Now a commanding figure in the half forward line and an excellent free taker. Was a key figure in the treble winning junior team of . His rather harsh sending off against Red Hugh’s almost certainly cost Limavady the Ulster title. At  there is a lot more to come from this excellent footballer  - Enda Lynn Good enough to captain his county for two seasons. This man is a virtual scoring machine. Such is his dedication that he has been known to train on Christmas Day. His pace and tireless running makes him nearly impossible to mark. Missed a lot of action last season with an injury. Greenlough and Derry will be glad to see him back againthe action ever resumes.  - Paudie O’Neill Probably the best club footballer in Derry never to get a county call. Time after time, he would win games on his own for the Henry Joys. His scoring tallies were mind boggling but like a lot of good footballer had ongoing injury problems. A loyal club player he often played through the pain barrier.  - Kevin O’ConnorEvery year he postpones his retirement is another good year for Foreglen. From being an excellent half forward he now brings his deadly accuracy to the role of target man. A quite superb free taker who is always calm and measured. Played a leading role in their intermediate championship win last season.  - Conleith Gilligan Has to be one of the highest ever scorers in Derry club football. From his teenage years to his mid-s his quality never dimmed. Be it from frees or open play, he seldom missed the target. His pace and ability to be in the right place at the right time marked him as one of the best. His retirement left a huge void in the Shamrock’s attack. He is now passing on his skills to others.

He was impressionable. In September, he was listening intently to the wireless, as Derry launched their first bid for Sam Maguire. He wasnt just reliant on the radio waves to savour the magic. Twice a week, the Derry team would train in nearby Newbridge and he got to meet his heroes. Where the towns Credit Union now resides, John Joe Diamonds cafe was located on Bellaghys Castle Street. Tommy, now  years of age, vividly remembers the scene as his mother Cathy made plates of sandwiches for the players before they ed home, to the four corners of the county. googletag.cmd.push “When you get the county stars in your kitchen twice a week, I got to know them all well and I was friendly with them through the years,” Diamond begins. Sean OConnell would later train the Derry teams that Diamond would captain to All-Ireland glory. “I played with him too, hiscareer lasted a brave while...he mustve been  when he was still playing with Derry,” Diamond adds. When Bellaghy All-Ireland winning manager Harry Cassidy took charge at county level, he called Diamond into the senior  in the early s. He was part of the team that toured New York and Connecticut. googletag.cmd.push “We went out to play exhibition matches out there. It was an experience to get out there. We also won the Wembley Tournament two years in a row.” The semi-finals were played in the iconic stadium, with the final played out in New Eltham. “I was taking a look the other day and I think I have played in every county in Ireland,” Diamond added, of a county career that ended in . But it was the s, when he left his greatest imprint. *** In , Tommy was on Bellaghys first county U championship winning team and was a minor champion three years later. At county level, Derry minors had yet to reach an Ulster final. The first of Diamonds three years in the county minor team began in the closing stages of a game in Dungiven, with Antrim in the lead. “I remember being threw on as a late sub and two balls were kicked right over the full-back,” he recalls. “They landed in my hands and all I had to do was to kick them into the net and I think we won by a point.” After another season of consolidation, a place in the final again eluded them, but there was a crux of a team still eligible for . “We knew from , we had a good  and we didnt lose many,” said Diamond, who was made captain. When Derry defeated Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh on their way to the  minor league final, they did so without the St Columbs Derry players who focussed on winning the MacRory and Hogan Cups, under the management of former Fermanagh player Fr Ignatius McQuillan, just four years after tiptoeing onto the Ulster Colleges scene. “Then seven or eight of them came onto the Derryteam – which was some help,” Diamond added. “FrShields was the man who put the backbone into us and Sean , he put all the final touches to us, he was a great trainer.  Sean OConnell, Tommy Diamond and Fr Seamus Shields with the Tom Markham Cup “We trained twice a week up in Ballinascreen and after training we went into Timoneys for sandwiches and milk every night.” Aside from the medals and success, Diamond is grateful for the memories and friendships built up, that stood the test of time. “If any of us ever meet each other, it is a half day session. Thats the great thing about it.” They hammered Donegal in the  first round, in Dungiven, but the win came at a cost with a knee injury to Chris Brown. In the semi-final it was a dferent story and it was a narrow - to - win over Down, a game that saw Phil Friel sustain three fractured ribs. “We beat Cavan in the final in Clones,” Diamond remembers. “It was a hard, dour match and a typical Cavan match with hard hitting and not a lot of finesse about it.” Derry were Ulster champions and with the Hogan Cup now in the county, there was an air of quiet confidence as the squad headed to Croke Park. Diamonds first memory of their epic semi-final with Roscommon was giving the referee his name. “I was marking Dermot Early that day and we got booked after  seconds,” he laughs. “It was some start to a semi-final. I caught the ball and as soon as I caught the ball, he hit me. He was about two seconds late, I hit him with an upper cut and put him on the broad of his back and both of us were booked.” Derry were - to - winners and with the game in the melting pot in the second half, Early pulled a penalty wide of the posts when the Rossies were four points in arrears. “The great Miacutecheaacutel Oacute Muircheartaigh was commenting and he called it the game of the golden goals. Every one of them was hit in from  yards, absolute screamers.” It was time for one last push. Derry had one hand on the Tom Markham Cup. So too had Kerry. *** The Kingdom had the breeze and thanks to some wastefulness in Derrys attack, Kerry were a point ahead at the break. Sean OConnells pep talk worked wonders and the cogs began to turn. Tommy Diamond and Seamus Lagans performance at midfield helped them to a - to - win. “I dont remember an awful about it.” Diamond says. Earlier in the day, GAA President Alf Murray asked himhad his speech prepared with the customary lines of Irish, should Derry win. “I had no Irish, so he penned out the speech with the phonetics and I tucked it into the pocket of my shorts”. The speech mustve slipped out during the game and as he stood on the presentation podium, Diamonds pocket was empty. “I am the first man to just speak in English, I dont think it went down to well but I just had to go ahead with it,” he continued. The team stayed out in Portmarnock on the Saturday and Sunday night. Just recently Donal Mullan, son of county official at the time Paddy, handed Diamond a ticket from the post-final banquet. “The entrance admission was just  shillings,” he added. The homecoming on the Monday took nearly six hours, with crowds coming out along the route to salute the new champions. There were bonfires as the team crossed the county border. On the final leg of the journey, the victory cavalcade of cars coming to Maghera streamed all the way back to Tobermore. The Brackaghreilly Pipe band led John Mulhollands decorated lorry up Maghera street. “I remember being up on the top of the cab. They had a seat and I was tied into it and held the cup,” Diamond proudly beams. “It was some occasion for the firstchampionship to come into Derry.” Two years later, with Diamond still as captain, Derry won the Ulster U title before getting trounced by Mayo in the All-Ireland semi-final in Charlestown. “We were favourites for Ulster but we just werent ready for it ,” Diamond admits. “We were a year young and the next year we were all U and Sean OConnell was still in charge of us.” In , Derry swept all before them in Ulster, with only Down putting up any sort of resistance and Seamus McCloskeys - tally was enough to see off Monaghan in the final. Kerry came to Ballinascreen for the semi-final and trailed - to - at half-time, but had pegged the team back to a point midway through the second half. Diamond was switched to mark Brendan Lynch and a Kevin Teague goal helped swing the game in the home sides favour. Holders Mayo were shocked by Offaly in the other semi-final, setting up a Croke Park meeting with Derry. The Oaks led by nine points at the interval with the Faithful County down to -men after the dismissal of Eugene Mulligan, before easing to victory. He was the first player to captain his county to minor and U All-Ireland titles. But for Diamond,  was far from over. Despite playing three years for Derry minors, it took Diamond time to break into the Bellaghy senior team who would win seven titles during the s. He was dismissed, along with his brother Laurence, in the  semi-final win over Kilrea and missed the final. “Bellaghy had a strong  of players,” Diamond points out. “I only got my place on the senior team when Anthony Madden went to Australia and I got his place at right corner back.” There was nothing  only football and it is still the case. Karls son James is the first of his grandsons to play senior championship for the blues. The recent underage production line represents the hope in the new batch in the club. “They have the greatest facilities and have everything you would want and we have no team,” Diamond adds, referring to the -year gap since the John McLaughlin Cup rested in Bellaghy. “At that timewe had no facilities but we had teams....its a change of circumstances.” He picked up the third of eight senior medals in , but the Bellaghy adventure was only beginning. Once again, Diamond was involved in a first as the club were crowned Ulster champions in the first year of the competition. Frankie OLoane scored - in a  point win over Pearses of Belfast in the first round and it was followed up by a victory over a Newry Mitchells side that hammered Bryansford in the Down decider, thanks to goals from Sean Lee and Tom Scullion. Bellaghy beat St Josephs in the final, a combination of Ballyshannon and Bundoran, played on December  in the falling snow. “They had Brian McEnf and about  county men in total. They had a strong side and they actually, by right, shouldve beat us, but we were that dogged that day,” Diamond states. “It was a really cold day and we got a bit of a lead up against them. It was a rearguard action against the breeze in the second half but we held out.” There was no All-Ireland series until  when East Kerry won the title. Bellaghy retained their Derry title with a win over Slaughtneil in  before losing the final the following year to Newbridge. When they bounced back, it took them to their finest hour. A - to - win over Lavey saw them win Derry title number . In Ulster, they defeated Ballybofey, Ardboe and Teemore before taking on Armaghs Clann na nGael in the Ulster final. A - to - interval lead put them on their way to a facile win. In the All-Ireland series, it was a dferent story and Frankie OLoane was twice their savour. Tommy Diamond, Hugh McGoldrick and Chris Brown led from the half-back line against Portlaoise, but it was OLoane who tied the game late on, before Hugh Donnelly scored the winner in a - to - win. In the final, they took on the might of UCC and once again it took OLoane, with his seventh point of the game, to level matters late on. When Hugh McGoldrick broke up a Cork attack, Brendan Cassidy went on to score and the Tones were crowned All-Ireland champions. “Theyhad  county players, they were from all around. Moss Keane was full-back, he was a big tower of a man but Tom Quinn was too much for him.”   All-Ireland club - Tommy is on the extreme left of the front row Later that night, Cassidys lorry ferried the team up and down Bellaghy street to a heros welcome. Absent was the cup, as East Kerry didntit. “It is the sort of thing they cant take away from you,” Diamond said, of achieving the pinnacle of club football. He would later turn to management and managed Derry for  months at the end of the s, but stepped down after he felt the County Board were not allowing him full control of the team. Before that, at the start of the  season, Bellaghy were unable to get a senior manager, so Diamond put his name forward. The Tones went seven seasons without a title and werent tipped for glory. “Nobody wanted to take it. A lot of these managers, unless theyare good they are not interested at all,” he said. After winning the Derry title, Diamond took his side to Crossmaglen for the opening game of Ulster. After a battle, Bellaghy came out on top, but lost in the next round by a point at home to Castleblayney. “We shot in and shot inand Blayney went on to beat Burren in the Ulster final. I went to it in Dungannon, it was a dour match, - to -,” Diamond recalls, as Burrens quest for four-in-a-row failed. ”I said I would take themas far as I can, there wasnt much hope for them. We got them going rightly and I was disappointed we didnt win an All-Ireland with that team. I felt they were good enough.” *** Another passion is golf. He has been member of Ballymena Golf Club for  years, where he still plays with lelong friend Gerry McCann. He has been a member of Moyola, where he is now the Ranger.  Tommy andSeve Ballesteros Another friend of Diamond, Willie Cassidy, pulled off a coup in  by bringing Seve Ballesteros to play a round at the course, just months after he won the Masters. “I think it cost pound, to bring him to Moyola, he was number one in the world and Willie got him,” Diamond adds. “It is the only course in the north of Ireland I think he played on and I had the honour of caddying for him, I was the lowest handicapper at the club. “I marked his card, he countersigned it and it is up in the clubhouse for ever more amen.” A letime of memories. Aside from the current lock-down, the chat continues every Thursday night over the winter. Tommy plays cards with friends and his sons. It is a ritual. The social hub and the legacy of parents John Joe and Cathys cafe continues. RELATED - Derrys path to their first taste of September. Click here...

They had a seat and I was tied into it and held the cup,” Diamond proudly beams. “It was some occasion for the firstchampionship to come into Derry.” Two years later, with Diamond still as captain, Derry won the Ulster U title before getting trounced by Mayo in the All-Ireland semi-final in Charlestown. “We were favourites for Ulster but we just werent ready for it ,” Diamond admits. “We were a year young and the next year we were all U and Sean OConnell was still in charge of us.” In , Derry swept all before them in Ulster, with only Down putting up any sort of resistance and Seamus McCloskeys - tally was enough to see off Monaghan in the final. Kerry came to Ballinascreen for the semi-final and trailed - to - at half-time, but had pegged the team back to a point midway through the second half. Diamond was switched to mark Brendan Lynch and a Kevin Teague goal helped swing the game in the home sides favour. Holders Mayo were shocked by Offaly in the other semi-final, setting up a Croke Park meeting with Derry. The Oaks led by nine points at the interval with the Faithful County down to -men after the dismissal of Eugene Mulligan, before easing to victory. He was the first player to captain his county to minor and U All-Ireland titles. But for Diamond,  was far from over. Despite playing three years for Derry minors, it took Diamond time to break into the Bellaghy senior team who would win seven titles during the s. He was dismissed, along with his brother Laurence, in the  semi-final win over Kilrea and missed the final. “Bellaghy had a strong  of players,” Diamond points out. “I only got my place on the senior team when Anthony Madden went to Australia and I got his place at right corner back.” There was nothing  only football and it is still the case. Karls son James is the first of his grandsons to play senior championship for the blues. The recent underage production line represents the hope in the new batch in the club. “They have the greatest facilities and have everything you would want and we have no team,” Diamond adds, referring to the -year gap since the John McLaughlin Cup rested in Bellaghy. “At that timewe had no facilities but we had teams....its a change of circumstances.” He picked up the third of eight senior medals in , but the Bellaghy adventure was only beginning. Once again, Diamond was involved in a first as the club were crowned Ulster champions in the first year of the competition. Frankie OLoane scored - in a  point win over Pearses of Belfast in the first round and it was followed up by a victory over a Newry Mitchells side that hammered Bryansford in the Down decider, thanks to goals from Sean Lee and Tom Scullion. Bellaghy beat St Josephs in the final, a combination of Ballyshannon and Bundoran, played on December  in the falling snow. “They had Brian McEnf and about  county men in total. They had a strong side and they actually, by right, shouldve beat us, but we were that dogged that day,” Diamond states. “It was a really cold day and we got a bit of a lead up against them. It was a rearguard action against the breeze in the second half but we held out.” There was no All-Ireland series until  when East Kerry won the title. Bellaghy retained their Derry title with a win over Slaughtneil in  before losing the final the following year to Newbridge. When they bounced back, it took them to their finest hour. A - to - win over Lavey saw them win Derry title number . In Ulster, they defeated Ballybofey, Ardboe and Teemore before taking on Armaghs Clann na nGael in the Ulster final. A - to - interval lead put them on their way to a facile win. In the All-Ireland series, it was a dferent story and Frankie OLoane was twice their savour. Tommy Diamond, Hugh McGoldrick and Chris Brown led from the half-back line against Portlaoise, but it was OLoane who tied the game late on, before Hugh Donnelly scored the winner in a - to - win. In the final, they took on the might of UCC and once again it took OLoane, with his seventh point of the game, to level matters late on. When Hugh McGoldrick broke up a Cork attack, Brendan Cassidy went on to score and the Tones were crowned All-Ireland champions. “Theyhad  county players, they were from all around. Moss Keane was full-back, he was a big tower of a man but Tom Quinn was too much for him.”   All-Ireland club - Tommy is on the extreme left of the front row Later that night, Cassidys lorry ferried the team up and down Bellaghy street to a heros welcome. Absent was the cup, as East Kerry didntit. “It is the sort of thing they cant take away from you,” Diamond said, of achieving the pinnacle of club football. He would later turn to management and managed Derry for  months at the end of the s, but stepped down after he felt the County Board were not allowing him full control of the team. Before that, at the start of the  season, Bellaghy were unable to get a senior manager, so Diamond put his name forward. The Tones went seven seasons without a title and werent tipped for glory. “Nobody wanted to take it. A lot of these managers, unless theyare good they are not interested at all,” he said. After winning the Derry title, Diamond took his side to Crossmaglen for the opening game of Ulster. After a battle, Bellaghy came out on top, but lost in the next round by a point at home to Castleblayney. “We shot in and shot inand Blayney went on to beat Burren in the Ulster final. I went to it in Dungannon, it was a dour match, - to -,” Diamond recalls, as Burrens quest for four-in-a-row failed. ”I said I would take themas far as I can, there wasnt much hope for them. We got them going rightly and I was disappointed we didnt win an All-Ireland with that team. I felt they were good enough.” *** Another passion is golf. He has been member of Ballymena Golf Club for  years, where he still plays with lelong friend Gerry McCann. He has been a member of Moyola, where he is now the Ranger.  Tommy andSeve Ballesteros Another friend of Diamond, Willie Cassidy, pulled off a coup in  by bringing Seve Ballesteros to play a round at the course, just months after he won the Masters. “I think it cost pound, to bring him to Moyola, he was number one in the world and Willie got him,” Diamond adds. “It is the only course in the north of Ireland I think he played on and I had the honour of caddying for him, I was the lowest handicapper at the club. “I marked his card, he countersigned it and it is up in the clubhouse for ever more amen.” A letime of memories. Aside from the current lock-down, the chat continues every Thursday night over the winter. Tommy plays cards with friends and his sons. It is a ritual. The social hub and the legacy of parents John Joe and Cathys cafe continues. RELATED - Derrys path to their first taste of September. Click here...

Monaghans Gerry Mone gave Derry a torrid time in the Ulster semi-final at Casement before Joe Brolly came from the bench to give the spark needed for victory. The Ulster final saw Damian Cassidy gracefully skating over the puddles in Clones, in a game the Derry players were going to win, come hell or high water. It took a late block by Tony Scullion on Manus Boyle and Brian McGilligans intervention to deny Donegal another goal chance, when they had crafted a two on one situation. googletag.cmd.push In the All-Ireland semi-final, it wasnt until Johnny McGurks wonder pressure point that Derry would eventually rest easy against the Dubs in the season-defining clash. Anthony Tohills outstretched arms of celebration before Joxers kick went over the bar will always stick in my mind. The branch of the Derry Supporters Shop at the top of Hall Street in Maghera was thronged with people in the lead-up to the final. There was so much expectation that Sam wouldon the Monday evening. In a powerful video interview with Shane Stapleton on #OurGame, Tony Scullion touched on how he felt the wave of emotion was almost congratulating them as they departed for the final. It was a Cork team that hammered a poor Mayo outfit in the semi-final, I thought. With hindsight and on watching the final, from someone outside the camp, the mental strength was Derrys greatest asset that day. Cork had nine players who had played in an All-Ireland senior final. They had played in five, winning two and losing twice, once after a replay. Derry, while being the upcoming team and having dispatched the  and  champions on their way, they were untested on the biggest day of the season. HAMMER BLOW From my position on the Hill that day, I can still see Joe Kavanaghs number  jersey cutting through the Derry defence before hammering past the advancing Damien McCusker. It was the first goal Derry had conceded since June , that sunny day in Castleblayney when Derry fans applauded Monaghan scoring their only point of the first half. In the second half, three Farney goals had Oakleafers shaking, before getting out with a draw. Kavanaghs goal brought me back to that day. Derry never do anything the easy way. Colin Corkery won the first two balls off Gary Coleman, John ODriscoll beat Tony Scullion to an early possession. Corks running game had Derry in all sorts of trouble. Fergal P McCusker and Henry Downey couldnt get to grips with Don Davis and Joe Kavanagh respectively. When Derry eventually went on an attack, Mark OConnor won the first battle with Seamus Downey. Derry were - to - in arrears. Was Derry going to fail the final hurdle again  Brian McGilligan then won a vital possession at midfield. It was small, yet massive. Later in the attack Damian Bartons trademark disguised hand pass - where he looked one way and gave the ball the other - found Johnny McGurk who fired over Derrys first point of the game. It took a series of Cork mistakes to swing the momentum. Teddy McCarthy dropped a routine pass from Niall Cahalane and McGilligan curled between the posts. The now dominant Tohill hoovered up a loose Teddy McCarthy pass before going on a storming run to win a free and Gormley slotted over. The Oaks were now only two points in arrears and growing in confidence. McGilligan turned the screw even tighter. John Kerins had been targetting Barry Coffeys height advantage over Johnny McGurk on his kick-outs. Across came McGilligan to win a ball he had no right to. It was inspirational. The big man launched a pass forward that eventually found Damian Cassidy. Cass swung a ball into the square. Seamus Downey made up the guts of  metres to take advantage of a mix-up between Kerins and OConnor, before punching to the net. Boom. Derry were on top. Heaney nearly beat Kerins to the ball for a further goal chance and, earlier, the Cork stopper made a brilliant save to deny Cassidy. Then referee Tommy Howard made two wrong calls. Cahalane buried Enda Gormley off the ball and got off with just a lecture. Seconds later, Tony Davis was harshly sent off for a lazy lunge at Dermot Heaney, with Howard gesturing the use of an elbow. It was the wrong call. The narrative was always that the punch woke Enda up. Thats harsh I feel. There was very little ball directed into his corner before that. Everything went thought Brolly. However, it lit a fire and Gormley went on to score six points. Derry twice led by three points and when Dermot McNicholl curled over, after the interval, it shouldve been the catalyst to push on. Brolly was toasting Brian Corcoran and shouldve been used more. John ODriscoll started the second half at wing forward, with Colin Corkery in on Tony Scullion. But when Don Davis inch-perfect pass took out the entire Derry defence, ODriscoll drilled to the net and Cork were ahead. Thats where the Derry resolve was again tested. And they passed. There was no sign of panic. McGurk was allocated the extra-man role. Fergal P McCusker, Henry Downey - and later McKeever – ran the show in defence. With the extra man, Damien McCuskers outfield experience saw him use short kick-outs before they were even invented. For all their control, they failed to ask any questions of Derrys defence, but when Gormley levelled the game, the Ulster champions superior fitness carried them into the three point lead. Even then, Derry did it the hard way. With Steven OBrien now at full-forward, Cork began to throw the dice for the last time. If every the term getting over the line was used, then this was all so relevant. Derry had performed better on other days during the Eamonn Coleman era, but winning was the only thing. Failure wasnt an option and they refused to be denied their moment of glory. It was richly deserved. Its just a pity there was no back door and that Eamonn was controversially sacked. This group had so much more to offer. RELATED - Sideline View wants Derry to fast forward.Click here...

Anthony Tohills outstretched arms of celebration before Joxers kick went over the bar will always stick in my mind. The branch of the Derry Supporters Shop at the top of Hall Street in Maghera was thronged with people in the lead-up to the final. There was so much expectation that Sam wouldon the Monday evening. In a powerful video interview with Shane Stapleton on #OurGame, Tony Scullion touched on how he felt the wave of emotion was almost congratulating them as they departed for the final. It was a Cork team that hammered a poor Mayo outfit in the semi-final, I thought. With hindsight and on watching the final, from someone outside the camp, the mental strength was Derrys greatest asset that day. Cork had nine players who had played in an All-Ireland senior final. They had played in five, winning two and losing twice, once after a replay. Derry, while being the upcoming team and having dispatched the  and  champions on their way, they were untested on the biggest day of the season. HAMMER BLOW From my position on the Hill that day, I can still see Joe Kavanaghs number  jersey cutting through the Derry defence before hammering past the advancing Damien McCusker. It was the first goal Derry had conceded since June , that sunny day in Castleblayney when Derry fans applauded Monaghan scoring their only point of the first half. In the second half, three Farney goals had Oakleafers shaking, before getting out with a draw. Kavanaghs goal brought me back to that day. Derry never do anything the easy way. Colin Corkery won the first two balls off Gary Coleman, John ODriscoll beat Tony Scullion to an early possession. Corks running game had Derry in all sorts of trouble. Fergal P McCusker and Henry Downey couldnt get to grips with Don Davis and Joe Kavanagh respectively. When Derry eventually went on an attack, Mark OConnor won the first battle with Seamus Downey. Derry were - to - in arrears. Was Derry going to fail the final hurdle again  Brian McGilligan then won a vital possession at midfield. It was small, yet massive. Later in the attack Damian Bartons trademark disguised hand pass - where he looked one way and gave the ball the other - found Johnny McGurk who fired over Derrys first point of the game. It took a series of Cork mistakes to swing the momentum. Teddy McCarthy dropped a routine pass from Niall Cahalane and McGilligan curled between the posts. The now dominant Tohill hoovered up a loose Teddy McCarthy pass before going on a storming run to win a free and Gormley slotted over. The Oaks were now only two points in arrears and growing in confidence. McGilligan turned the screw even tighter. John Kerins had been targetting Barry Coffeys height advantage over Johnny McGurk on his kick-outs. Across came McGilligan to win a ball he had no right to. It was inspirational. The big man launched a pass forward that eventually found Damian Cassidy. Cass swung a ball into the square. Seamus Downey made up the guts of  metres to take advantage of a mix-up between Kerins and OConnor, before punching to the net. Boom. Derry were on top. Heaney nearly beat Kerins to the ball for a further goal chance and, earlier, the Cork stopper made a brilliant save to deny Cassidy. Then referee Tommy Howard made two wrong calls. Cahalane buried Enda Gormley off the ball and got off with just a lecture. Seconds later, Tony Davis was harshly sent off for a lazy lunge at Dermot Heaney, with Howard gesturing the use of an elbow. It was the wrong call. The narrative was always that the punch woke Enda up. Thats harsh I feel. There was very little ball directed into his corner before that. Everything went thought Brolly. However, it lit a fire and Gormley went on to score six points. Derry twice led by three points and when Dermot McNicholl curled over, after the interval, it shouldve been the catalyst to push on. Brolly was toasting Brian Corcoran and shouldve been used more. John ODriscoll started the second half at wing forward, with Colin Corkery in on Tony Scullion. But when Don Davis inch-perfect pass took out the entire Derry defence, ODriscoll drilled to the net and Cork were ahead. Thats where the Derry resolve was again tested. And they passed. There was no sign of panic. McGurk was allocated the extra-man role. Fergal P McCusker, Henry Downey - and later McKeever – ran the show in defence. With the extra man, Damien McCuskers outfield experience saw him use short kick-outs before they were even invented. For all their control, they failed to ask any questions of Derrys defence, but when Gormley levelled the game, the Ulster champions superior fitness carried them into the three point lead. Even then, Derry did it the hard way. With Steven OBrien now at full-forward, Cork began to throw the dice for the last time. If every the term getting over the line was used, then this was all so relevant. Derry had performed better on other days during the Eamonn Coleman era, but winning was the only thing. Failure wasnt an option and they refused to be denied their moment of glory. It was richly deserved. Its just a pity there was no back door and that Eamonn was controversially sacked. This group had so much more to offer. RELATED - Sideline View wants Derry to fast forward.Click here...

Michael McWilliams writes a weekly column in the Irish News called Dodgy Tackle. For this weeks column, which is in todays Irish News, McWilliams puts forward his best ever team. The criteria for selection is based on the premise that his World XI must be made up of up of players from dferent countries who have never played for the same club sides. McWilliamssfinal selection includes many of the worlds best known footballers - and our very own Felix Healy. googletag.cmd.push His full line-up is: Manuel Neur , Junior , Paul McGrath , Paolo Maldini , Felix Healy , Paul Gascoigne , Dragan Stojkovic , Zinedine Zidane , Kevin de Bruyne , Kenny Dalglishand Diego Maradona . Explaining his choice of Healy in the midfield, McWilliams states that it was a straight fight between the Derry man and the Colombian World Cup Carlos Valderrama. He writes: Carlos Valderrama nearly went in here, but when it comes to moustachioed midfield fulcrums, the Derry man gets in on a dodgy decision. And it is Dodgys decision. Hes playing at the base of the Diamond. Just across from the Sandwich Co. Pulled the strings for an early eighties Coleraine side that delighted this young fan, all shimmies and subtlety. The only things hairier than his upper lip were the legs bulging out of a pair of royal blue Adidas hotpants, briefly ditched for a pair of white ones as he led the Honduras midfield a merry dance for  thrilling minutes at the  World Cup. Swapped blue and white stripes for Candy ones later in the decade and a treble was duly delivered. Can now be seen leading punters a merry dance in music venues across the north-west. googletag.cmd.push And McWilliams had a message for anyone who believes that Colombian star Carlos should have got in to his side ahead of Healy. You can stick your Valderrama up your Bogside, he writes.

Therersquos plenty like me and we are all in the same boat.ldquoIt started when I received requests from nurses who I made their wedding or bridesmaid dresses in the past for. I ended up making scrubs for some entire hospital wards, male and female and in a iety of sizes.ldquoThat widened out to sewing for staff at local nursing homes. I just want to do something to help, particularly for nursing homes as my daughter, Abigail, works in one in Castlewellan.There is plenty of work to be done to complete her bridal orders, but Mrs Moorhead feels that her priority is for scrubs.ldquoMy weddings have been pushed back until October or November or even next year. There are things that would hamper me. I canrsquot see brides to fit them and I wouldnrsquot want to go too far ahead with orders in case some people gain weight or lose weight, she said.ldquoAlso,the wedding changes seasons, that can change the outfit ordered in style and colour. For instance, a mother of the bride might want a jacket as well or might want to lose or shorten sleeves so I feel I canrsquot go to far ahead with my orders. Brides have needed me to reassure them that everything will be alright for their big day, whenever it happens, and I can absolutely promise that.ldquoAbigail is getting married in November and her sister, Johanna, is getting married next May, so they will be the most special wedding dresses I will make in my letime. I feel that I have to keep going with the scrubs as itrsquos so important. However, I will make sure that I will provide all outfits that have been ordered from me. It has become a family affair as Mrs Moorheadrsquos husband, Joe, who also is unable to work as an engineer in the lockdown, helps with the pressing of the garments while Johanna helps with the sewing.Mrs Moorhead has been creating the scrubs from donated material, much of it brand new, and is very grateful for the donations..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar man takes Chance with move to Hong Kong 26 years later opens superstore  ","story":"AT the age of  and without a word of Cantonese, Richard Bowsie left his family and friends behind in his home village of Crossgar for a le of adventure in Hong Kong.Twenty-six years later and now a married father of two, Richard has found love, happiness as well as a successful career as the owner of two second-hand furniture stores in the huge cosmopolitan city with over seven million inhabitants.He and his locally-born we, Mavis, run nd Chance Furniture that provides shoppers in the city and online across the world a virtual Aladdinrsquos Cave with thousands of unique and affordable items - ranging from lacquered tables to pool tables, Chinese vases to Balinese drums.While other young ambitious men were told to lsquogo westrsquo, Richard went east, finding Hong Kong to be every bit as much the land of opportunity as the United States.The father of eight year-old daughter Kailey and son George, whorsquos coming five, literally changed his le in three days when he made the decision to fly to Hong Kong.From working as a leguard at the Tropicana centre in Newcastle and at the former Down Leisure Centre, the former student of the High School, Ballynahinch, had been close to completing his BTec qualication in Leisure Management at the former Newcastle College of Further Education.He ped out of his course a few months shy of graduation due to bullying. While his parents, Margaret and Ken, a well-known architect, were shocked at their middle sonrsquos decision, they were not surprised.He recalled: ldquoI had a friend who had travelled to Hong Kong three months previously. During a phone call he told me that the new international airport was under construction and work was easy to find. Three days later I arrived.ldquoI decided to go by myself as I had been trying to find an exciting job at home for a while but kept being told I was too young for the roles or lacked experience. My parents knew I was ambitious and how frustrated I was becoming with my career ambitions being knocked back all the time.Richard admitted he hadnrsquot a clue what to do once he arrived and took a bar managerrsquos job as an interim position as many of the airport workers drank there.His first job at the airport turned out to be with the Northern Ireland company, Lagan Construction Group, before going to another Belfast-based company, Rotary International, with which he worked for two years.ldquoI felt excited and nervous all at the same time when I first moved to Hong Kong, said Richard.ldquoThe first thing that struck me was the heat, after leaving cold and damp of home. Arriving in  degrees and high humidity was certainly a shock to the system, despite having been on family holidays to France most years with my family and once to America with a cross community group. The heat in Asia was a massive shock.Having grown up in a rented manse on the Rademon estate, Richard swapped a quiet rural existence for the hustle and bustle of the global port and major commerce centre. It was still under British rule and would remain so for another three years before it was handed back to China.Richard said: ldquoLanguage was the biggest shock but I made it my mission to learn the language and enrolled in YMCA lessons but also managed to pick it up from also working alongside locals.It wasnrsquot long before Richard felt confident enough to start out his own business, an electrical supply company which employed  staff.He said: ldquoI knew after the first few months that Hong Kong was going to work for me,you worked hard, nothing could hold you back, age was not an issue here. Opening a business here was very straight forward, just need a bank account and register an address.He met his we Mavis during his first month in the city and the two have been together ever since.They opened their first store in  in the after seeing a large amount of good furniture being thrown away each week and were determined to do something that would reduce the waste and help the environment. Within months, they had outgrown this store and relocated to their current , sq ft premises in Tuen Mun.The couple has recently opened a second, , sq ft premises in Chai Wan which is closer to the busy capital.Fluent in Cantonese for many years, Richard has seen Hong Kong go through many challenges, not in the least with the recent coronavirus pandemic.ldquoHong Kong has handled the virus very well, having been through SARS and bird flu before, said Richard. ldquoAs soon as we heard there was an issue over the border in China, Hong Kong went straight into prevention measures before even being advised to. Now everyone wears masks and observes hygiene measures.The preventative measures must have been successful as the city recorded zero deaths on Monday for the first time since the outbreak before Christmas.While the move to Hong Kong was the right one for Richard, he still misses home and his brothers and sisters, Simon, Gillian, Laura and William.He said: ldquoI miss the food, the greenery and, of course, my family who are all still in Northern Ireland. I miss being close to home as I have lost family members and grandparents.ldquoBut we come home as often as we can. Mavis and the kids love Crossgar, especially AJs Diner. They love the Rademon estate where we lived beside, walks down the Church Road to Kilmore and the open green fields. We have very few here in Hong Kong and any we do have are full of mosquitos.Home is always on Richardrsquos mind, as is his business.He adds: ldquoNext for our business is hopefully more expansion as I would like to start exporting furniture to other countries such as Northern Ireland.

Mr James said bluntly yesterday:ldquoThere are people who had an opportunity to say things at an early stage but did not. Now they have really pulled the carpet out from under our feet at an advanced stage. Irsquom bitterly disappointed at this kind of timing.The problem arose when the Housing Executive was in the final stages of preparing a scheme, which has been on the drawing board for several years, when it was told of the Government objections to a number of potential sites, including the Burren River catchment area and another, the most important, at the Dundrum Road end of the town.The Executive had finally got an agreement to purchase from the landowner of the Dundrum Road site and had made a final routine check with the Government departments before clinching a deal.

They have agreed with us that the water which they required was not there and this scheme would have caused serious ecological damage.Confirmation that the objectors had won the fight over the Kinahalla scheme came on Friday, when the Environment Minister, Mr Philip Goodhart, said his department had accepted the findings of the Commission which came out against the pound. million project.News that the Commission had recommended the scheme should be ped was leaked last month.

It is also my understanding that Newry, Mourne and Down Council and Northern Irelandrsquos other  councils are working closely alongside the government department at this time.Cllr Walker said he would like to see the recycling centres open again, suggesting that strict controls could be introduced to only allow two vehicles access them at any one time.ldquoI would also appeal to people at this time to keep their waste until the recycling centres are open again. I appreciate that many people who are not at work at the moment are making the most of the time they have to clean out their homes, sheds and garages and I commend them for being active.ldquoHowever, it simply isnrsquot on to load up you car with waste, drive to a secluded area and dump it. I just donrsquot understand the mentality of people who engage in this kind of behaviour.Cllr Walker also said the cost of clearing up illegal waste is borne by the districtrsquos ratepayers.ldquoWe have the ironic situation that those who dump their waste illegally end up paying for its removal viatheir rates. This beggars belief, he declared. ldquoThe stupidity of those who dump waste in secluded areas is beyond me.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe time has come for common sense and people really need to catch a grip of themselves. One of the most worrying aspectsof illegal dumping is that waste which ends up in fields is sometimes eatenby livestock which often results in deadly consequences. To those who dump their waste illegal my appeal is stop now.The local council has confirmed that it is receiving increasing reports about fly-tipping across the district since the start of the COVID- crisis. But the organisation insists that it is currently able to manage the issue within existing resources.A council spokesman said that the organisation continues to work closely with the Environment Agency which also performs a key role in addressing incidents of larger illicit dumping.On the issue of reopening the districtrsquos household recycling centres, the spokesman explained that the decision is continually being reviewed in line with government social distancing measures.He continued: ldquoFly-tipping is illegal and the council will strictly enforce this where evidence can be gathered. Responding to fly-tipping incidents also erts important council resources away from providing other essential services.The spokesman confirmed that the council is unable to remove illicitly-dumped waste from privately-owned land, explaining that where this occurs, both it and the Environment Agency has the legal powers to request its removal.He said the council will enforce this where required.The spokesman added: ldquoThe council would urge the public to avoid producing any unnecessary waste, including undertaking DIY and house and garden clearances at this time due to the considerable pressure being placed on public services.ldquoAny additional waste that is produced should be stored for future disposal at the household recycling centres once they re-open.

In a glittering playing career, the Ballykinlar man went on to win two more All-Ireland medals and established himself as one of the legends of the Gaelic football. Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals. He was the leading scorer in Ulster for eight seasons and in Ireland for three years.Now in his s, hersquos followed Downrsquos fluctuating fortunes ever since, relishing in theof the glory days in the early s, sharing in the disappointment of the barren times and casting a critical eye from the sidelines, though always with the optimistic outlook of the true fan.So what does he believe is the greatest Down team of all time Not surprisingly, given their accomplishments, hersquos largely selected his choice from his team-mates from the Sixties mdash though with typical modesty, he has not picked himself for the starting .ldquoYou have to remember that the Down team of s was the first to bring the Sam Maguire over the border, he says.ldquoThat was a really big achievement and we had beaten Kerry in the final. We had shown we were the best team in Ireland and we proved that again the following year in the final against Offaly after beating Kerry in the semi-final. We also beat Kerry in the  final, which meant that we had beaten them three times.ldquoKerry have always been the benchmark. If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 Queen.jpg","title":"Queen Karen Europe’s best  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH grandmother is a European powerlting champion at the age of .Karen Burns won the European title in France in March and set a new world record in the process.Powerlting involves three disciplines mdash squat, bench press and deadlt mdash and Karen capped a brilliant performance with a world record breaking lt of  kilos in the deadlt.Itrsquos a fantastic achievement for Karen, who only took up powerlting four years ago.The legal secretary, who has two daughters and four grandchildren, started gym classes at the age of , but within a few months made the switch to powerlting.Coached by Aaron Kelly, from Affinity Fit at the CG Fitness gym in Annacloy, she trained four times a week and was soon competing and winning medals at a national, international and world levels.She was the British champion two years running in  and .

I noticed within the first several days that I was able to breath more easily in the mornings and I was coughing much less. I am not a smoker.ldquoThe incessant pace of traffic in the street has slowed to a hush and my window sills inside my house are much cleaner. Before the lockdown, I could have drawn a line across the sills with my finger and it would have left a white mark in the soot which would gather.ldquoHaving the time that lockdown has inadvertently provided, I decided I would respond to a call-out to have-a-go playwrights to write something about their experience of self isolation.Gavin describes the scene as he pulled out the plug to let the water away. ldquoIt suddenly came to me as I watched the water drain away that it was an analogy for humanity, that we too are in great danger of being sucked down the plug hole to oblivion.So I got ready and immediately wrote the whole play sitting on the edge of my bed. It took me  minutes and I spent the next three weeks reworking it until I was happy.Central to the play is Jake, a man in his late s, who is in self-isolation and being cared for by his put-upon daughter, Martha.Gavin explains: ldquoWhile shersquos out getting groceries, he ponders upon the plight of the human race as it is metaphorically sucked down the plughole to oblivion.ldquoThroughout the play, Jake is visited by several characters mdash a City shark who represents the financial markets, a Navy er who see that humanity is in terrible trouble, the Prime Minister and God, who commands a less-than-enthusiastic Jake to build an ark and save mankind.Gavin says Jake becomes overwhelmed thinking that itrsquos too big of a job to build an ark. Hersquos not surehe has got the energy.ldquoThe play also includes two young mothers debating a brutal and radical way to build a new plug from the flesh and bone of every misfit in society, two floating dim-witted teenagers and a dancing bath plug bearing a last minute solution to the problem, said Gavin.ldquoAt the end of the play, Jakersquos lottery numbers come up and his winning ticket appears in the beak of a dove mdash the Christian symbol for peace.Down the Plughole, which reads as a tragicomedy, shines a spotlight on modern society and its impending doomlove and kindness fail to prevail.Gavin says he has taken inspiration from two comic plays, One Man, Two Guvnors by Richard Bean and Government Inspector by Nikolai Gogol, and the classic novel by William Golding, Lord of the Flies.Gavin added: ldquoJake realises that in the end money is worthless and that love and good health, which are in short supply in the play, are all that is important.Amelia Madan, head of amateur plays at Josef Weinberger Plays, said: ldquoDown the Plughole is a hilarious, ludicrous and bold play for these crazy unchartered times.ldquoWe are delighted Gavin chose to put some of the uncertainty about out fate as a species we all feel, into words, with a generous dash of delicious absurdism and a fabulous ending..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Spa.jpg","title":"Spa Wells LOL provide gift packs to health workers  ","story":"LOCAL Orangemen have been looking out for frontline workers during the current public health emergency.Members of Spa Wells Orange Lodge distributed free gt packs which included Easter eggs and cosmetics for health workers based at two local nursing homes.Approximately  staff who care for elderly residents at Fishbourne House and Spa Nursing Home were thrilled to receive their pamper packs and thanked the lodge for thinking of them in the current situation.Lodge member John Aiken said they were delighted with the success of their community project and added they are currently working on another similar community-based initiative..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11296099.jpg","title":"family party hold maud celebrates th distance social distancing","story":"PLEASENOTEIt is a tough time for our entire community and especially the business community.

This would be known as Serious Condition Criteria.While widely welcomed, what was not made clear was Departmental staff have discretion around who meets criteria and can overrule a claimantrsquos medical evidence.A number of enquiries were submitted to the Department under a Freedom of Information request.The responses are concerning.The Department stated legislation does not refer to serious conditions but rather whether there is a relevant change of circumstances. The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who are unlikely to ever move into work: ldquoTook effect from  September , but did not result in legislative change.The Department was asked about the right of appealing a decision rejecting a claimant for Serious Conditions Criteria, who responded: ldquoThere is no automatic right of appeal against a determination which is embodied in or necessary to a decision. , a claimant has a right of appeal against an outcome decision rather than a determination, which is merely a component of the outcome decision.This was complicated for non-legally trained or represented claimants, so questions were put around full compliance with the Disability Discrimination and Human Rights.The Department responded stating it: ldquoDoes not hold any information relating to this hellip.may have been undertaken by DWP.A copy of the risk-assessment template used by the Department in instances of considering Serious Condition Criteria, was requested, but: ldquoNo template existsInstead, the response referred to assessment procedures where Departmental Healthcare Professionals advise on the re-referral period, and consider whether a claimantrsquos condition meets: ldquoThe new severe conditions criteria andno further assessments are required.However, the claimantrsquos own medical professionalrsquos opinion around Serious Condition Criteria could be over-ruled, with this decided by: ldquoAn Administrative Officer appointed by the Department.In respect of providing the legislation or guidance which permits the Department to overrule clinical opinion provided by a claimant seeking consideration under the Serious Condition Criteria, the response referred to ESA Regulations , which: ldquoProvides for the redetermination of whether someone has limited capability for work. The time period in relation to this is not set down in the legislation but is largely at the Department Decision Makers discretion ndash usually based on available medical evidence including medical reports from ATOS hellip The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who would be unlikely to ever move into work, took effect from  September  but did not result in legislative change.As the Freedom of Information request was answerd prior to the restoration of devolution, the Department was asked with a Minister now in post, to comment on current processes around Serious Condition Criteria decision-making and in particular, how it can by discretion supersede a medical diagnosis by a claimantrsquos clinician. It was also askedprocedures are under review andthere is intention to bring forward legislation to allow for scrutiny or challenge.A spokesperson said: ldquo Anyone claiming ESA will be automatically assessed for the Severe Conditions criteria at their Work Capability Assessment by a Healthcare Professional. If the personrsquos condition or its al effects meet the criteria, the Department will be advised that no further assessments are required.In response to the overruling of clinical decisions, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe Work Capability Assessment looks at the al effects of a personrsquos condition, rather than the diagnosis itself. It is not a supersession of the opinion of their clinician.This dfered to the response provided prior to the Minister taking office, which appeared to show the Department was permitted to over-rule the evidence of claimantrsquos clinician.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reality is we will look at the medical evidence. The Northern Ireland Executive will have its own flexibility and we may see across the country some iations we saw some iations going into lockdown as well. Itrsquoll be a decision that all four nations take together based on the evidence, he said.Mr. Lewis said he was aware of the complexities of Northern Irelandrsquos Border with the Republic of Ireland amid the pandemic, explaining that he has been meeting with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle OrsquoNeill and Taacutenaiste Simon Coveney.ldquoEven where there are dferences in the approach between the Republic and the North,there are,we know that we can make sure we are clear with residents why those dferences are there.ldquoThe challenge of having iations within Northern Ireland is how we manage that.An investigation in The Sunday Times at the weekend featured a Whitehall source claiming the government ldquomissed the boat on testing and PPEand ldquojust watched as the death toll mounted in Wuhan, China.The report also claimed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson missed five crucial COBRA meetings in the Cabinet Office in London.When asked to respond to these serious allegations, Mr. Lewis said: ldquoI didnrsquot recognise some of what I saw in the Times.ldquoI was in the Cobra meetings in January and February COBRA meetings are chaired by the Secretary of State in the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms. Itrsquos a place, not a thing.ldquoWe were making decisions the scientists and medical experts were making decisions at that time and planning was going on. This is the point to judge it now when we have two months more evidence is dangerous and a misleading thing to do.Turning to PPE which has been an issue in Fermanagh, Mr. Lewis used his own constituency of Great Yarmouth as an example of where there has been ldquono problems with accessing equipment.He added: ldquoWersquove had gowns sent over to the UK, OrsquoNeills [sportswear] converted to gowns, there is gin distillery in your part of the world producing sanitisers.ldquoWersquore shting five and a half million pieces of PPE across to Northern Ireland. Wersquove been able to supply that itrsquos in good order. I am talking to the first minster every day that.Mr. Lewis said the priority of the United Kingdom government is to make sure ldquowe donrsquot hit the second peak of the virus.ldquoOne of the most damaging things economically would be, as well as health wise, to start coming out of lockdown ndash restaurants, pubs, whatever start opening again ndash and suddenly you have to close down again and thatrsquos not viable.ldquoI think itrsquos right to be cautious about this wersquoll make that decision in a few weeks.ldquoThe science is shting on this the experience is changing. I am cautious about predicting what will be in a few weeksrsquo time.He believes the government could ldquoflatten the curve of Covid-people continue to stay at home, adding: ldquoWe want to see past the peak, you donrsquot want to see a downward trend and ease up as all you do is let it shoot back up again.ldquoIf you think back to the beginning there were some quite scary numbers being put about by some experts about what the deaths might be. Now any death is too many and we have sadly lost people, friends and family who have gone through tragic experiences recently, and the figures are nowhere near those numbers we saw at the beginning.ldquoThatrsquos because the public across Northern Ireland and the UK have done a good job generally of following the guidelines which means we can flatten that curve, he said.Mr. Lewis explained that he had personal experience of people close to him who had been diagnosed with Covid-, including his parliamentary private secretary.ldquoSomeone I know lost a member of their family this week, I have a few people in family who had the disease.

There is a transition period where you are not really the Archbishop of Armagh but you want to be as helpful as you can and you are also I suppose trying to work out what and how you are going to approach the task.The Archbishop-Elect explained the three facets to the roleHe said there was the appointment of Bishop of the Diocese of Armagh, which has a larger population with a great number of large towns in it than Clogher Diocese.In addition, there is the role of Primacy of All Ireland, considered lsquoFirst among equalsrsquo acknowledging there is another Primate in the southern province but to some degree to be an ambassador for the Church of Ireland.He added: ldquoThe third element is your place within the wider Anglican Communion which I have relatively little experience of. You become a member of the Primatersquos Meeting which is one of the instruments of communion within Anglicanism. There are a number of ways we hold ourselves together, the Lambeth Conference, the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Anglican Consultative Council and more recently, the Primatersquos Meeting.So what type of church do you see under your leadership ldquoItrsquos dficult to speak for the church as the Church of Ireland General Synod is the body which has that authority. There is a saying that the Church of Ireland is synodically governed and episcopally led. What the Archbishop of Armagh can do is to speak to the Church and suggest can concern itself with. It sets a bit of a tone as well. Itrsquos about its spiritual le and its own governance and the need to acknowledge that like probably all institutions and all bodies some bits of it do well and some do not do well some bits are growing and some bits are shrinking some bitsvery well and some bitsnot so well and to maybe try to discover that the bits that do not do well could do a bit better, in terms of spiritual le and acknowledging there is a huge ersity within Anglicanism and to remember that thatrsquos all part of the Anglican heritage.ldquoThere are obviously particularly challenges at the moment, what the church says to society and what it does for the society in which it is placed. You cannot pretend it doesnrsquot live in a political context. Politics is not something that just happens in Parliament. Democracies are places where political discussion or dialogue are about what we can do together or decisions which are deeply embedded. There are institutions which are recognisable bodies in civil society such as the business community, trade unions, voluntary sector and churches are one of those. I think they have their particular things to say and its perfectly legitimate for them to say it.ldquoThe big imponderable at the moment is coronavirus and we have no idea how deeply that will affect the patterns of society. We could come out the other side of that challenge a changed society, with maybe small changes and maybe some very profound changes. Of course the other big external issue is Brexit which involves the relationships between the dferent regions within Ireland and the United Kingdom.ldquoI could be in both parts of that jurisdiction in one day praying for good governance for both of them and for their leaders, he said.In terms of reaching out to people in the Church of Ireland, the Archbishop-Elect recalled how a Northern Ireland Le and Times survey revealed around  per cent of people in Northern Ireland attend church at some point. He said the heyday for attending church was in the period from the late th Century to the period to the middle of the s. But he thinks current attendance is ldquoback to the old norm with fewer people committed to regular churchgoing.He rightly points out that churches are among the very few inter-generational bodies with people of dferent ages attending.The Archdeacon-Elect says people in very small rural parishes are committed to their churches in the sense that they are contributing to their community who feel it is being enriched with their presence. He said the church finds its place in the community.ldquoThe second challenge is what we are for ourselves as a group, as a faith community, how we build up the church, which canrsquot live in isolation but we have our particular family traditions - how we contribute to the ersity of Ireland, how we build up the church to be confident communities of faith and not hesitant or fearful or invisible communities of faith.He said for the Church of Ireland, there was tremendous heritage from Anglicanism.ldquoThe Church of Ireland has a particular way of doing things, liturgically. Liturgy is both the expression and source of our belief. Our vocation may be to hold together what on the face of it appear to be contradictory things is maybe one of our roles in religious and spiritual le. I have no ideait is the best way to be a Christian but it is our way and it seems to contribute something to the catholic church, the wider church.ldquoHarry McAdoo, a well-known Archbishop of Dublin and a great scholar, once said, lsquoIf I hadnrsquot been born an Anglican, I would have had to become one.rsquoThe Archbishop-Elect leaves Clogher Diocese after forging and maintaining good relations with other denominations.He said: ldquoI think the vast majority of committed Christian people see more in common with other Christian traditions than separating us. There is a very long history of ecumenism in the diocese of Armagh as well. There is a long association and friendship with Archbishop Eamon Martin and I hope we can continue to build relationships and friendships.The Archbishop-Elect trained for Church of Ireland ministry after a career in industry in which he held a senior role in Shorts and was for a time, Assistant Director of the CBI in Northern Ireland.ldquoThat probably give me some skills in organisation and about leadership. Irsquove been very lucky here. Irsquom not very fond of the word lsquoleaderrsquo in the ecclesiastical world but one of the things a leader does is to build a team around him. It is almost a contradiction in terms to be involved in a leadership role in Christianity, to do it on your own.ldquoThere are certain things as a bishop that end with you. There are plenty of lonely moments in that sense where you have to make decisions. But by and large business acclimatised me to working with all sorts of dferent people from all sorts of dferent backgrounds in dferent ways and to experience what every parishioner experiences, normal working le with those pressures.As Bishop of Clogher the new Archbishop-Elect held a number of positions nationally and internationally representing the Church.He was the Church of Ireland contact person to the Churches of the Porvoo Communion which represents the Scandanavian and Baltic Lutherans as well as the Spanish and Portuguese Anglicans and other Anglican churches and provinces from these islands making contact at senior level travelling with them.He has also held senior roles on the Irish Council of Churches, the national ecumenical instrument and also the Irish Inter-Church meeting, the latter which includes the Roman Catholic church.He said those bodies were important especially as ecumenism was becoming bland and it was important to keep going and keep talking.These inter-church bodies contribute to providing resources for churches around Brexit, homelessness, welfare reform and subjects churches would be expected to have a voice in.ldquoI enjoyed that hugely, I am coming to the end of that, six years in total two years as vice-President, two years as President and two years as outgoing Vice President. I will be involved again as a member of the Church Leadersrsquo Meeting.The Archbishop-Elect says of his time in Clogher Diocese ldquoItrsquos always been an aim of mine wherever I have worked to try to create a family atmosphere where there are degrees of mutual respect and degrees of mutual accountability. I remember saying that the diocese of Clogher is big enough to do thingswe all pull together in the same direction and small enough for everybody to be necessary for that to happen and to be accountable for what the contribution is. If you treat people with respect, then relationships are easier.ldquoBy and large I felt people were for me rather than against me. It helpsyou are reasonably interested in people and their families and what they do and acknowledge that as an important factor in their faith. Whoever the next Bishop of Clogher is theyshould allow him or her to be his or her own bishop of Clogher and not that they should be like me, Brian Hannon or Michael Jackson or like St. Macartan.The Archbishop-Elect says he enjoys reading history and poetry and in terms of music, takes particular pleasure in the tradition of Anglican anthems . He does admit to particularly enjoying the Psalms which are poetry.The Archbishop-Elect acknowledges that his mother who had a profound influence on his le, reciting the Daily Office at home and was happily committed to God and His Church and would have sung the Te Deum while washing the dishes. One of her favourite biblical phrases was from the Gospel of St. John, Chapter  ldquoI come that you would have le and that you might have it more abundantly.Relaxation for the Archdeacon-Elect is visiting one of his favourite places, the Ulster Museum to see the collection of Irish Art and reading.ldquoThe thing I am looking to reading most is I took possession of the third volume of Hilary Mantelrsquos Wolf Hall trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, lsquoThe Mirror and Light,rsquo an historical novel, he adds.The Archbishop-Electrsquos we Mary teaches in Enniskillen Royal Grammar School and his daughter, Dorothy, is at the University of Oxford.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Many parents are having to juggle working from home with home-schooling, and it is no surprise that Dr Justin Williams, a psychiatry expert at the University of Aberdeen, has concluded that stress amongst parents is growing as the lockdown continues. Most parents are not trained to educate their children, many will not have the time or the expertise to do so, despite many schools providing online educational tools. Trying to educate your child while doing your job effectively is surely not feasible in the medium or long term.There is also the obvious impact on children. If schools here don’tuntil September, that will be the best part of half a year wiped away from a child’s education. That is vitally important from both an educational and social perspective.Of course it would be unreasonable and unrealistic to flick a switch and expect schools toexactly as they operated before. A staggeredat some stage for dferent age groups has been mooted, while reducing classroom numbers might make social distancing easier to achieve.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Planning when and how schoolsacross the UK must surely be a key part of the government’s lockdown exit strategy. \"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland have six. As was pointed out by Ben Lowry , around the Mournes, much of it is overrun by single dwellings.I can only conclude that the main reason we do not have a national park is because of the culture that exists here. I do not care how much money people have, but when planning decisions take away large swathes of the countryside and wildle habitat, it then becomes all of our concern.This is not an orange and green issue, but one of protecting the beauty and wildle of our country for generations to come.John Mulholland, DoaghBen Lowry: The RHI scandal has been a reflection of the struggle to keep good people in politics"},{"url":null,"title":"nspcc young people can be lonely home ","story":"Sam McBride: Riven with ision, this Executive’s deadly contradictions are growingFreephone witness appeal line launched by investigators after -year-old man dies in NI car parkNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensCoronavirusNewsOpinionLettersNSPCC: Young people can be lonely at homeAt a time when children and young people are stuck at home, it is still possible for them to feel lonely.By LettersMonday, th April , : am\"\"Letter to the editor : Johnston Press ResellAnd because the majority of schools are closed, children are without the support network so readily available to them in a traditional classroom setting, and they may be venturing online to find solace.New research from the NSPCC shows that lonely children who are relying more and more on social media are twice as likely to be groomed online.More than , young people from across the UK, aged between  and , were surveyed by the NSPCC last year, with % confirming they had sent, received or been asked to send sexual messages to an adult online.

Please try again later.Submitting...But there is more evidence that some politicians are already looking beyond the current crisis to what it will mean for their political aspirations.In comments reported by The Sunday Times yesterday, Ms McDonald said: “When Brexit happened, people said this is an accelerant in terms of the unity debate, because it was so obvious with the danger to the border.“I think this dwarfs Brexit in terms of reflecting the danger of partition, the fact that it’s not sustainable, and the necessity for us to work as one island.”The Sinn Fein leader went on: “It’s astonishing we have an all-Ireland single policy for animal health but not for public health.“Everything we do to keep people safe has to be on the understanding we are a single population on a small island and have to look after each other.”Ms McDonald, who only ed to work last week after recovering from Covid-, said that Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill had “some pretty tough conversations to get the northern system in tandem with what was happening in the south” and added: “Yet again we see how vulnerable we are when we have two jurisdictions, two systems, on the island.”However, Dr Kyle said: “To try to make a political point here is really facile it’s premature. Rather than making political points, we should be focusing our energies on working together and not bringing ision ...people are playing party politics at this stage, I think that is very foolish, opportunistic and a bit crass.”Dr Kyle said that so far the health service in Northern Ireland had “dealt well with a dficult situation” but that there should be practical cooperation wherever it was needed without attempts to make political gain.He said that the pandemic needs to be dealt with on a global basis, with “all countries working together”.The east Belfast councillor said that would mean that “it is of course better to work in a cooperative manner with the Republic of Ireland. But similarly, it would be better for Ireland to work with the UK cooperatively”.He added: ”We need to have a sense of working together – both the UK and Ireland – because both our nations are so closely connected.”The veteran former GP also questioned those politicians who are urging Northern Ireland to follow the Republic because Ireland is an island.He said it was too soon to pass judgment on how the UK and Ireland had handled the emergency.“In retrospect, there will need to be a review of what has happened but in this situation people are trying to anticipate the future without all the facts in front of them, so decisions are based on the best information we have and people in good faith are trying to reach the best conclusions they can for the welfare of the public.“To pretend the south of Ireland is handling this well and the UK has made a hash of it is a rather ill-informed judgment because we are not yet at a point where we can review things properly and we are not comparing like with like – dferent population densities, dferent public transport systems, dferent demographic profiles, dferent proportions of black and ethnic minority populations who are particularly vulnerable, dferent levels of poverty, and so on.“To make the case that the pandemic strengthens the case for Irish unity is rather foolish. “What it does is strengthen the case for nations working together in a collaborative way.”—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

If your dog stays where they are, wait a moment, then go back and reward them with an extra treat.Increase the distance you move away and the time you wait before ing with the extra treat. You should soon be able to leave the room and close the door or gate. Progress to spending more time in a dferent room. Build this into the daily routine.It’s important that your dog remains relaxed. If they show signs of distress, leave them for a shorter period, or don’t move as far away, next time.Rachel Casey, Director of Canine Behaviour and Research at Dogs Trust, said: “For many of us it has been great to spend so much time with our dogs during lockdown andmostly our dogs love us being around too. But all this extra attention could potentially create a ticking time bomb of separation anxiety for our dogs. If they expect us to be about all the time, it will be more dficult for them to cope once we go back to our normal lives and aren’t in the house  .“Now is the time to act to avoid future problems – and it’s easy to do. Just make sure that you factor in time apart from your dog each day to help them be able to cope when alone – this could be separated from you by a door or child gate for an hour or two whilst you’re working or home schooling the kids. By organizing your dog’s day, with time apart, play times, exercise, other activity sessionsand quiet times, you can make sure that your dog maintains their ability to cope with the dferent aspects of ‘normal’ le when we get back to it.”For more ideas on how to keep your dog occupied visit www.dogstrust.org.uk--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

However, four weeks have now passed our Council has not met.“Given that the NI Assembly and the WestminsterParliament are still meeting, we believe that as with the previous special meeting, appropriate social distancing measures can be put in place and a meeting should take place in the WJ Mayes Hall.“It is our view that the full Council should be meeting at this crucial time as it is the elected members who are responsible for the direction and decisions being made for the organisation.“Party leaders meetings are good forums for discussion but they are not a placefor making decisions and we respectfully request that members are allowed to fulfiltheir democratic duty to govern the borough.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

INPT-. : -TONY HENDRONNNLocal MLA Jonny Buckley said: “I’m relieved that the Northern Ireland Executive have now come to the collective decision of reopening our cemeteries in a controlled manner.“This has been an extremely sensitive issue for grieving families and I am glad that Executive Ministers have reconsidered their stance.“Please keep safe whilst visiting the cemetery and adhere to social distancing rules.”Local MP Carla Lockhart said: “I know this has been heartbreaking for many families who have lost a loved one. Please await Council guidance on opening times and guidance on regulations.”Councillor Paul Berry said: “Let’s think of all those people who had loved ones die due to COVID and other health related illnesses but who couldn’t visit their loved ones grave . A very tough time for many many people.”SDLP Upper Bann said they were awaiting further details of opening hours and how it can be managed with social distancing but added: “For many people this visit is very important to them as part of their grieving process and something which they did on a daily basis prior to the pandemic.“The lockdown has robbed them of that special moment in the day where they go to visit the resting place of their loved ones.”Cemeteries were closed when social distancing measures were introduced towards the end of March .The NI Executive met on Friday afternoon and agreed that cemeteries throughout Northern Ireland could reopen.“This is about balancing public health concerns with the basic human need for people to visit their loved ones,” said First Minister Foster.Mrs Foster stressed it remains vitally important that the public remember they must continue to adhere to social distancing guidelines and wash their hands.Sinn Fein and the Alliance Party had previously supported the decision to close cemeteries across Northern Ireland.However, deputy First Minister and Sinn Fein vice-president, Michelle O’Neill, said the decision to re-open cemeteries came about because they had “listened carefully to the genuine distress of families who have not been able to visit the grave of a loved one”.“I understand that there’s a fine balance and making sure that people do not face additional burden in terms of their mental health and well-being and also our role in making sure that people are not put at further risk from the transmission of coronavirus,” she said.“So the opening of graveyards would only be permitted where there are those in charge of burial grounds that can ensure that we have compliance with the regulations and appropriate social distancing.“We continue to keep these issues under review,” she said.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1587656147249.jpg--marts_to_reopen_gradually.jpg?158765614700","title":"marts to reopen gradually ","story":"THE Department for Agriculture, Environment and Ruralaffairs has welcomed the decision by the Northern Ireland Livestock and Auctioneers’ Associationto open Livestock Marts on a gradual basis from Monday,  April.Livestock Marts closed voluntarily on  March - including Rathfriland Co-Op and Hilltown Saleyard - in response to Covid- health and safety concerns.

Part of that food supply chain is the ability to trade and sell animals.“Staff within the Department have maintained regular contact with Livestock Mart operators over recent weeks and have been reassured that robust operational protocols, developed by the Marts in conjunction with other stakeholders, will enable them to conduct business in a manner that is safe for staff, farmers and buyers and adheres to social distancing requirements.“DAERA therefore welcomes the decision to recommence sales of primestock, cull animals and store stock on a gradual basis from week commencing  April.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dadaafeaffecaa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aebdbabcecdcd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
