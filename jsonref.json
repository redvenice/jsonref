The Duke of Sussex brusquely rips up royal unity again by saying deal is NOT what he wanted, writes RICHARD KAYWere these the first cracks in the highly polished exterior, an unmistakably emotional outburst ripping up the carefully choreographed royal script and, for the first time, appearing to directly question the agreement struck with his grandmother the Queen?Privately, friends insisted he was doing no more than clarifying his position when he forthrightly spoke out about his future at a dinner in a fashionable restaurant.But others around Prince Harry fear it was a sign of something more fragile, something that has echoes of his late mother Princess Diana.With the ink barely dry on the deal that allows him to escape the straitjacket of being a working royal, Harry\u0027s sudden decision to use a private event to pass a very public judgement on it was not just discourteous to the Royal Family, but also dramatically undermined the harmonious accord it had been presented as hours earlier.         Above all Harry\u0027s speech demonstrated how raw and how unpredictable the drama over his and Meghan\u0027s split from the royals really isNo wonder there was consternation at the Palace yesterday. Above all Harry\u0027s speech demonstrated how raw and how unpredictable the drama over his and Meghan\u0027s split from the royals really is.Harry\u0027s intervention has been likened to that of a merger between two companies when, after it has been successfully concluded, the chief executive of one of the firms suddenly announces \u0027this isn\u0027t what I wanted\u0027, blindsiding directors, shareholders and workers.His remarks – included in a speech he delivered on Sunday evening at a glossy event at Chelsea\u0027s Ivy Garden in aid of the charity Sentebale, which he founded to honour his mother\u0027s legacy supporting those affected by Aids and HIV in the African kingdom of Lesotho – addressed the crisis over his future head on.Coming just 24 hours after he had apparently signed off on the agreement struck between him, the Queen and his father Prince Charles, Harry\u0027s anguish couldn\u0027t be clearer: he was telling the world that this was not what he wanted.He had, he said, hoped to continue to serve the Queen and Commonwealth and, crucially, retain his military associations.\u0027Unfortunately that wasn\u0027t possible,\u0027 he declared.For all his optimism about leaps into the future, it was a speech tinged with regret. \u0027It brings me great sadness that it has come to this,\u0027 he said at one point.           The Harry I know will be desperately torn over the repercussions of his decision to walk awaySomething, surely, with which the Queen would heartily agree.Her Majesty may be less pleased, however, that her grandson decided to speak out at all. In her own measured and generous statement the previous evening, the Queen deliberately spoke warmly of Meghan, describing her pride at how quickly the 38-year old duchess has become \u0027one of the family\u0027.And in promising that Harry, Meghan and their son Archie would always be \u0027much-loved\u0027 members of the Royal Family, she was mapping out a future in which they would not be exiled. These words were intended to be conciliatory, a peace-making gesture.Did Harry wilfully misinterpret this kindness or was he simply hell-bent on showing that his exclusion from those aspects of his royal life which mean the most to him was not his doing?As someone who has followed the fortunes of Prince Harry for this newspaper since his first day at nursery school, I would like to think that it is the latter.Less charitable voices within the Queen\u0027s household are not so sure. One figure suggested that at the very least Harry had demonstrated an act of incivility to both his father and his grandmother.This was hardly the first time Harry has so brusquely intervened as the crisis unfolded in ways not to his liking.It is almost two weeks ago that he sensationally announced that he and Meghan were quitting their frontline royal roles – without forewarning the Queen, Prince Charles or Prince William. Indeed, the first the Queen learned of it was from an evening television news bulletin.The reaction of the Queen – and Charles – since has been informed by their desire to avoid repeating the mistakes that occurred with Harry\u0027s mother over her split from the Prince of Wales.Almost exactly 24 years ago the long-term discussions about Diana\u0027s future also erupted into the public consciousness with the princess accusing the Palace of playing \u0027ping-pong\u0027 with her.It concerned her status as a orced woman outside the Royal Family and also pivoted on a title, in her case the style Her Royal Highness. Like Harry, she viewed the handling of her issue quite differently from the Palace.Royal officials claimed she had offered to surrender the HRH title without duress. Diana angrily disagreed insisting it had been a \u0027pre-condition to any orce negotiation\u0027.The Palace hit back with a chastening statement oozing with disdain, which spelt out that it did not \u0027say something specific on a point like this unless we are absolutely sure of our facts\u0027.Shattered by the ferocity of the negotiations, Diana did not fight the title issue and in the end it helped secure her £17.5million orce settlement, a sum that Charles\u0027s then financial adviser said had \u0027taken him to the cleaners\u0027, forcing him to sell his entire investment portfolio. But Diana bitterly regretted losing the HRH style and pointedly quit as patron of 100 charities as a result.She felt passionately that organisations like Help the Aged and British Red Cross Youth deserved a royal patron and that the loss in her standing as result of her title being forfeited would be to diminish them.           The reaction of the Queen – and Charles – since has been informed by their desire to avoid repeating the mistakes that occurred with Harry\u0027s mother over her split from the Prince of WalesHer only consolation was the promise from the then 14-year old Prince William that he would restore it when he became King.There are other parallels with the Sussex crisis, too. Diana was constantly linked with commercial deals, from a fragrance named after her by a French perfume house to being the face of a high street fashion brand.They offered her mega-bucks but she turned them all down – just as she did Kevin Costner who wanted her to star with him in a remake of The Bodyguard. She could have made millions but didn\u0027t.Significantly, she also resisted the constant blandishments of money-rich US TV networks. In her case she was pursued by the veteran Barbara Walters.Did all this turbulence in his mother\u0027s life resonate with Prince Harry at the Ivy on Sunday evening?Certainly, he made no fewer than four references to his mother during his brief speech, including one poignant reference to her death. \u0027When I lost my mum 23 years ago, you took me under your wing,\u0027 he said.And to be fair there was humility in his words too as he spoke of his \u0027utmost respect for my grandmother, my commander in chief\u0027.He also acknowledged how grateful he was to the Queen and \u0027the rest of my family\u0027 for the support they have shown Meghan.But that gratitude is somewhat tested by remarks made as he attempted to put his side of the story.\u0027What I want to make clear is we\u0027re not walking away,\u0027 he said. \u0027Our hope was to continue serving the Queen, the Commonwealth and my military associations, but without public funding. Unfortunately that wasn\u0027t possible.\u0027As an ex-soldier, with distinguished service in Afghanistan, quite apart from his work with veterans and the Invictus Games he founded for wounded, injured and disabled veterans, losing those Army links clearly hurts.Elsewhere in the speech, if it wasn\u0027t his mother\u0027s influence it was his wife\u0027s, who he was proud to say \u0027upholds the same values as I do\u0027.

And using an Americanism he added: \u0027I know I haven\u0027t always gotten it right, but as far as this goes, there really was no other option.\u0027Really? Some might say that after less than two years as a working royal couple, Harry and Meghan had barely got started.After all he stresses his commitment to duty and service. You can almost hear the anguish in his voice when he says at one point: \u0027We were here to serve.\u0027So why aren\u0027t they? And what went wrong in his mind that stopped them doing just that?When royal couples in the past have struggled matrimonially or with the burden of their role, the Queen has always been a sympathetic ear.But she also has the \u0027five-year test\u0027. Don\u0027t do anything hasty, let\u0027s see how things work out over five years, is her measured response. In recent years both the Duchess of Cambridge and the Countess of Wessex have been challenged by searching public criticism and they have emerged as two of the most reliable and popular members of the Royal Family.And what about Camilla, Harry\u0027s stepmother? No royal figure has taken more knocks in public life but she has been quietly transformed as Duchess of Cornwall performing a vital role as Prince Charles\u0027s consort.Even Charles and Diana delayed their separation at her request to try to make the marriage work.The more one looks at the whole sorry situation it does seem the Sussexes decision to walk away is one made in haste. But then everything about them has happened at speed.From that first meeting – a blind date in a London restaurant – to Harry almost immediately whisking Meghan away to camp out in the Botswana bush to her settling in to cosy Nottingham Cottage, his London home at Kensington Palace, everything has been at pace. Everything conducted like a holiday romance – him in Canada, both going to Africa, she visiting England – but with drama at every turn. And in the flash of an eye they were engaged, married and undertaking big overseas tours.Was it any wonder that after that breathless trip to Africa – its brilliance overshadowed by the spectacularly misjudged decision to complain about their life in the spotlight in a television interview – they needed a break.Seven weeks of introspection later they appeared to make their announcement without any real thought about its impact and now find themselves fire-fighting public anger and disappointment at their treatment of the 93-year-old Queen.Perhaps this was really why Harry spoke as he did. The Harry I know will be desperately torn over the repercussions of his decision to walk away. One thing he could do which would assuage public criticism concerns his promise to repay the £2.4million of taxpayers\u0027 money spent on Frogmore Cottage.Rather than have it transferred into an anonymous fund where it will be used to the repair costs of royal properties, a friend of the prince has suggested he earmark it for a specific project such as a school or a hospice.Diana would certainly have approved. When she learned of the money being used to build the Millennium Dome in 1997, she pleaded with ministers to spend the estimated £750million on a new regional hospital instead.

Ofsted introduced a new inspection regime last September, which focuses more heavily on the quality of the curriculum on offer, rather than exam results (file photo)They raised particular concerns about the effect on children from disadvantaged backgrounds.In its annual report, Ofsted also says it still has concerns about the numbers of pupils leaving schools without another to go to and the practice \u0027off-rolling\u0027.This is when a pupil is removed from a school\u0027s register without being formally excluded, or a parent is encouraged to remove a child from a school when the removal is in the interests of the school rather than the youngster.Ofsted\u0027s latest figures show that 20,000 children left their state schools between Year 10 (2017) and Year 11 (2018).For around half of these pupils, it was not possible to see where they had gone because they had not moved to another state-funded school, the report says.They may have moved to a private school or into home education, Ofsted says, but adds it cannot be sure.The report says that there are 340 schools with \u0027exceptional levels of pupil movement\u0027, of which around 100 have been inspected this year.Of the 20,000 pupils who left their school overall, 22 per cent were in one of these 340 secondaries, it adds.It does note that high levels of pupil movement are often for legitimate reasons, such as families leaving an area, pupils moving to a specialist school, parents waiting for a place in their first choice of school and parents choosing to home educate.Ofsted published five inspection reports last year that refer directly to \u0027off-rolling\u0027.In these cases, the report says, inspectors found that some pupils left \u0027to primarily serve the schools\u0027 best interests, not the pupils\u0027.The report also touches on unregistered schools, with three cases successfully taken to court and resulting in convictions.But it adds that Ofsted still urgently needs stronger powers to seize documents and for the government to tighten the legal definition of a school and of full-time education."},{"url":null,"title":"Speeding motorists face new guidelines","story":"Share this article He appeared before magistrates in August when driving his Porsche at 36mph in a 30mph zone took his penalty points total up to 12.Coogan was given a two-month rather than a six-month ban after saying the full punishment would have forced him to cancel a new Alan Partridge TV series, putting up to 20 jobs at risk. The new guidance, likely to go into operation after a three-month consultation period, tells magistrates: \u0027Courts should be cautious before accepting assertions of exceptional hardship without evidence that alternatives, including alternative means of transport for avoiding exceptional hardship are not viable.\u0027          The new guidelines state that courts should be cautious before accepting assertions of exceptional hardship.

As he unveils a powerful virtual reality artwork, he talks about needing a monster to fight – and why he’d like to be a barber‘When we filmed this,” says Ai Weiwei, “the elephants didn’t know what to do. Once they were used for labour, and now they have lost their job.” The artist is talking about the groundbreaking documentary he has just made about unemployed logging elephants in Myanmar. You watch the film, shot with 360-degree virtual reality technology, through a special headset. Turn your head slowly and your view gradually changes. Turn your head 180 degrees and the picture changes completely.“When they lost their job,” he continues, “each elephant had a few people to take care of it, so those people also lost their job.” Ai (Weiwei is his first name and means unknown or future) relates to the elephants as readily as he does to the subject of the second part of his VR project – this one about the lives of Rohingya refugees in a Bangladeshi camp.The Chinese artist and activist understands loss, displacement and existential danger as well as anybody. And what he wants to talk about today is his personal sense of threat. It’s four months since Ai quit Germany for Britain, and he is adapting quickly to his new home. He orders English breakfast tea and lays into the country that gave him refuge after fleeing China in 2015. Germany is intolerant, bigoted and authoritarian, he says. And he’s barely started.Does he really believe that post-Brexit Britain will prove a haven of tolerance? He smiles and says he’s here primarily for his son. He believes 10-year-old Lao will get a good education in Britain – and will be safe. “I don’t want him to live in harsh conditions. I don’t think Germany provides a good environment for foreigners.” He mentions that Lao was recently threatened by a shop owner there.While Ai insists he has no illusions about Britain, he still thinks it will be better for his family. “In Britain they are colonial. They are polite at least. But in Germany, they don’t have this politeness. They would say in Germany you have to speak German. They have been very rude in daily situations. They deeply don’t like foreigners.” If Britain does let him down, he assures me he’ll let us all know.We meet at an upmarket hotel in Cambridge, the city where the 62-year-old now lives. He is dressed in trademark black, head shaved and beard clipped. There is something mesmerising about him: he has the appearance of a bouncer, the manner of a priest and the language of a revolutionary. With the gentlest of voices, he continues to eviscerate Germany. “I don’t like a state or culture that so obeys authority.” Ai has never been one for obeying authority.He slurps his tea and smiles. “Germany is a very precise society. Its people love the comfort of being oppressed. In China, too, you see that. Once you’re used to it, it can be very enjoyable. And you can see the efficiency, the show, the sense of their power being extended through the connected-mind condition.” You mean there is no room for iniduality? “Yes. They have a different kind of suit: it doesn’t look like what they wore in the 1930s, but it still has the same kind of function. They identify with the cult of that authoritarian mindset.”Is he comparing today’s Germany with Nazi Germany? “Fascism is to think one ideology is higher than others and to try to purify that ideology by dismissing other types of thinking. That’s Nazism. And that Nazism perfectly exists in German daily life today.”Then there is his own experience. He mentions the three times he has been thrown out of taxis. There was no overt racism, he says, but he was pretty sure what lay beneath it all. Tell me, I say. “It’s a long story,” Ai replies, as he often does. “On one occasion, there was a strong perfume. I am sensitive to perfume, so I have to take down the window, and they say, ‘Pull up the window.’ I say, ‘No, the perfume is too strong.’ And they say, ‘Just get out of my taxi.’”Where was this? “Berlin! Berlin, every time. And another time in a taxi, the driver was listening to music and my phone rings. My mum calls me from China, I have to answer. He says, ‘Shut off your phone.’ I say, ‘This is my mum.’ He says, ‘You have to shut off your phone.’ Then he suddenly braked and me, my son and girlfriend were thrown forward.”Ai has spent his life fighting for justice. Perhaps it’s in his blood. His father, the poet Ai Qing, was sent to a labour camp in the countryside for criticising Maoist communism. Ai shows me a photo of the family home – a cave in the middle of nowhere. “My family had to live in this black hole for five years.” Ai Qing’s new job was to clean the ditch that served as the village toilet. How did he cope with his change in circumstances? “He was a man with a big heart, and had great acceptance.”Following Mao’s death in 1976 and after 19 years of manual labour, Ai Qing and the family returned to Beijing. His work was “unbanned” and he regained his prominence. “He is still considered the number one national poet,” Ai says proudly. “They call him the people’s poet. He was a really passionate, romantic fighter. A soldier. He always talked about justice, beauty and integrity. He believed in a perfect world. I believe life is a struggle for it.”Ai enrolled in the Beijing Film Academy and studied animation – one of many courses he failed to complete. He then became one of the first of his generation allowed to study in the US. He was told by his tutor that his drawings lacked heart. He never drew again. (Ai shows me a drawing of a forest he did as a student, which his father used to illustrate a book of poems. It is exceptionally beautiful). He did all sort of jobs to support himself: collecting rubbish, factory work, carpentry, babysitting and barbering.He befriended beat poet Allen Ginsberg, went to the same parties as Andy Warhol, whose work he adored, discovered Marcel Duchamp and dadaism, and began transforming readymade objects into art (including Hanging Man, a homage to Duchamp made from a wire coat hanger).Ai returned to Beijing in 1993. Since then there is little he hasn’t done in the name of art, protest and fun – often in the same work. So we have the 100m hand-painted porcelain sunflower seeds that filled the floor of the Turbine Hall in London’s Tate Modern the gorgeous Forever Bicycles sculpture composed of 1,254 stainless steel bikes and Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn, in which he smashes a 2,000-year-old vase. His art delivers social critique as visual puns. With the sunflower seeds he suggests we are all different despite appearances with the vase he destroys history just as Mao did and with the bikes he comments on cultural uniformity.Some work is more solemn: a list of names of the 5,219 schoolchildren who died in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake (obtained from a year’s research) the documentary Human Flow, in which he visits refugee camps around the world and reflects on man’s inhumanity to man. Other work has transformed the landscape – Ai co-designed the Bird’s Nest, as the 2008 Olympic stadium in Beijing became known, though he has since said he regretted creating such a monument for the state and has never stepped foot inside the finished building. And some work, if it is work at all, is just plain bonkers, such as the joyous video of Ai and his friends dancing Gangnam Style.With the Bird’s Nest, he became famous as a dissident artist and seemed untouchable, protected by his popularity. Then in 2010, he claimed to have been beaten by police while trying to report a previous incident, in which he was punched in the head by a policeman, leading to him suffering a brain haemorrhage. “I was hours away from dying,” he says. That same year, the authorities tore down his government-funded studio. Rather than protesting, he turned the event into a piece of performance art, holding a crab feast to celebrate the act of destruction. (This was another classic Ai pun. He xie, the word for crab, sounds just like “harmonious” in Mandarin – a word used by the government to describe society, and reclaimed by critics to mean censorship.)In 2011, Ai was jailed and told he faced 13 years in prison for subversion of state power, but was released after 81 days and given a $2.4m (£1.5m) fine for tax evasion. The money was raised by supporters worldwide. Ai’s passport was confiscated and he was placed under house arrest for four years. When his passport was returned, he left for Germany, where he had been offered a professorship at Berlin University of the Arts.I ask if he thinks he would have been an artist if he hadn’t grown up in China. “No,” he says. “No, I would not be an artist because an artist is not something I would have rated as important. My interrogator in the secret police once asked me, ‘Weiwei, if we don’t give you so much pressure, you would never be so famous, right?’ And I said, ‘Yes, you are right. It takes an enemy to make me a soldier. If I don’t have a great monster to fight, who am I?’”Ai is clear about the purpose of his art: it is not primarily aesthetic or cerebral, it is political. “If my art has any meaning, it is as a tool for freedom. If I see people victimised by authoritarianism, I am a soldier in defending their freedom. I can be as brutal as any animal to protect the essential value I love.”As I’m talking, I notice him taking a picture with his phone. Was he taking a photo of me? He laughs. “No, the camera is taking the photo.” He has been doing this for years wherever he goes. Ai really is gloriously eccentric. Whether his selfies are in the name of art, entertainment or bearing witness, it’s hard to know. I’m not sure he even knows.Ai has spent a great deal of the last five years filming displaced people (and now animals) in the world’s troubled spots. And he’s exhausted. He thinks his days as an artist may be coming to an end. For 15 years, he adds, the world has treated his work with respect, and that is never good for creativity. “I almost don’t think of myself as artist now,” he says. “My curiosity is getting less and less. The art culture institutions say, ‘Oh, Weiwei have a show next year with us.’ I’m suddenly very privileged, but now I’m getting tired.”Privilege does not sit easily with him. You sense part of him would like to return to his days in the cave with the family, or struggling on $3 a day in the US. Will he retire? He looks at me in disbelief. “I cannot say I’ll retire, but maybe I’ll disappear.” Where to? “Maybe I’ll disappear in Cambridge!” Will he go back to China? “I want to. My mum’s old and I want to see her. I’ve not seen her for a few years.” But he worries that he may be arrested or have his passport confiscated.So what would he do if he stopped making art? He smiles mischievously, slurps his cold tea and takes out his phone again. He shows me four short films of young people with trendy haircuts. Their hair is entirely shaved on one side, then they flick their heads and magically they have a full head of hair. “When I was young I used to cut all my classmates’ hair. Three days ago, I cut the hair of these four students.” He looks so chuffed with these “optical illusion” haircuts. “I did four in 20 minutes. I am a proper professional! I may open a barbershop in London.”He seems to be getting more into the idea by the second. “I think it is more fun to be a barber than an artist,” he says. Couldn’t he mix art with barbering? He shakes his head vehemently. No, he says, definitely not. “You would never mix such a holy profession with art.”• A trailer of Omni will be shown at a  event with Ai Weiwei on 30 January at Cadogan Hall, London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cde6d82463999465d08cecc89ffe4d3e9c45d6a/134_407_3714_2229/master/3714.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a9472198ed87f5cb44ee513ee2073a0","title":"dior judy chicago feminist banners","story":"Would buildings resemble wombs? Would God be female? Would there be violence? This collaboration between the new woman at Dior and the great feminist artist had some terrific bannersOn Monday, Dior’s haute couture show took place within the mighty womb of a female deity, created by formidable American artist Judy Chicago. Guests were seated within a custom version of an unrealised sculpture the influential feminist had first proposed in 1977 as Inflatable Mother Goddess. Chicago’s proposition “What If Women Ruled the World?” set the tone for a fashion collection inspired by proto-feminist heroines dating back to prehistory.Embroidered banners, three-metres high, posed follow-on questions: “Would Buildings Resemble Wombs?” “Would God Be Female?” “Would There Be Violence?” “Would Both Women and Men Be Gentle?” It was a spectacular backdrop for the fashion show, though Chicago pointed out that the sculpture and its hangings were more than that. “We made art,” she told the New York Times.This is not the first time Maria Grazia Chiuri, artistic director of Dior, has looked to women artists for inspiration. For her second collection, models trod the runway in Breton tops embroidered with “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?” in tribute to art historian Linda Nochlin. Ever since, feminist art has been as much of a house signature as the bar jacket.The springsummer 2018 couture show paid tribute to sexually upfront surrealist Leonor Fini. Last spring, ready-to-wear was shown surrounded by Italian gender provocateur Tomaso Binga’s naked Mural Alphabets. The setting for the couture show last June was designed by the magnificently forthright and inventive Penny Slinger: the collection closed with a golden dress shaped like a doll’s house in tribute to the British-born artist’s psychologically charged work.These spectacular collaborations are not gimmicks. As an art nerd they may excite me, but I don’t kid myself that the fashion world will necessarily thrill to collaborations with less-known octogenarian feminists. These are not easy or flippant references: internationally renowned, Chicago is a better-known exception among those whose work Chiuri has celebrated on the runway. For all, the Dior collaboration offered a wider audience – and, I imagine, a welcome injection of cash toward the end of uncommercial careers. As Chicago has pointed out: “It’s no fun to be old and poor.”Chiuri is to be congratulated. As the first female artistic director of Dior she has a highly visible public platform and is using it to celebrate work she is passionate about, and which she believes deserves a larger audience. Not only is she supporting women artists, whose work continues to be underrepresented in museum collections and undervalued at auction, in celebrating magnificent older women she resists the fashion world’s obsession with youth.Is it weird for a feminist artist to work with a fashion brand? Only if you believe that fashion and feminism can’t be bedfellows. Does fashion promote unrealistic beauty and body ideals? Yes, but no more so than social and network media. Does it engage in the oppression of women through reliance on a casual, unregulated workforce, much of it female? Often, yes. These are all wider social and industrial issues that need to be addressed on a wider social and industrial level. (Chicago’s banners, incidentally, were made with the Chanakya School of Craft, a nonprofit organisation based in Mumbai.)Fashion is also about play, identity, challenging ideas of beauty, celebrating well-made things, sexual allure and the transmission of coded cultural messages. Chicago – who sports violet hair, dark purple lipstick, sharp suits and eye-catching jewellery – is not shy of the transformative effects of colour, form and beautifully crafted objects. She celebrates women as sexual beings, as creators, as mothers and caregivers, and has recently explored the process of ageing and the prospect of death with great frankness.The very reason that Nochlin felt the need to pose her question “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?” – and by extension the reason that Chiuri has felt it important to celebrate women at Dior – is that the art world has been, and continues to be, bedevilled by systemic prejudice, of which sexism is only one component. It seems to me no more anomalous for feminist artists to engage with the fashion world, for all its faults, than an art industry that has for decades failed to adequately engage with and value their contribution.The impulse to question the validity of support offered to one woman by another perpetuates a destructive ideal, according to which no feminist gesture can ever be adequate, no cultural contribution sufficiently pure. Cherish the support. Learn from it. Emulate it. As Nochlin wrote at the end of her famous essay: “While great achievement is rare and difficult at best, it is still rare and more difficult if, while you work, you must at the same time wrestle with inner demons of self doubt and guilt, and outer monsters of ridicule.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bebc03efec20ac606b50bc26cac423d537e893e3/0_0_2351_1581/master/2351.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9f3351c62d88cdee783fa3568e94753 1010w","title":"the volunteer jack fairweather review","story":"This astonishing account of Witold Pilecki, a member of the Warsaw resistance who tried to incite rebellion in the camps, won the Costa biography awardJust after Witold Pilecki’s arrival at Auschwitz concentration camp in September 1940, Deputy Commandant SS-Hauptsturmführer Karl Fritzsch addressed the 5,000 prisoners: “Your Poland is dead forever and now you are going to pay for your crimes through work,” he declared. “Look there, at the chimney. Look!” he shouted. “This is the crematory. Three thousand degrees of heat. The chimney is your only way to freedom.” In case anyone had not got the message, guards then beat a man senseless with clubs in front of them all.A former cavalry officer in the Polish army, Pilecki was a member of the resistance in Warsaw. When news reached them in July 1940 that a concentration camp had been opened in a former Polish army barracks near the town of Oświęcim, Pilecki volunteered to be captured and taken to the camp – which the Germans called Auschwitz – in order to gain intelligence about what was happening there and to organise a break out. Few men had returned alive from Auschwitz and it was an incredibly brave decision. When a prisoner learned that Pilecki had volunteered to be there he was astonished: “If what you say is true you’re either the greatest hero or the biggest fool.”Pilecki quickly began organising an underground network in Auschwitz, but conditions were far worse than he had imagined. There were constant beatings, humiliations and a starvation diet, all designed to break down bonds between prisoners and to destroy them psychologically as well as physically. According to Pilecki, “some slithered into a moral swamp. Others chiselled themselves a character of finest crystal.” He was certainly in the latter group.By October prisoners were dying at the rate of about a dozen a day. Pilecki managed to smuggle a message out to the resistance in Warsaw about the “monstrous torture” being endured by prisoners. He was confident they would act. On Christmas Eve the guards put up a tree in the camp festooned with lights: “For a joke, the SS had stacked as presents under the tree the bodies of prisoners who had died that day in the penal company, mostly Jews.”Despite Pilecki’s optimism, as the months turned into years it became clear that help was not coming. Yet he did not give up. Each time someone escaped or was released, they carried reports for the Warsaw resistance. In October 1941 he detailed the gassing of Soviet prisoners using Zyklon B: “He had witnessed the creation of the camp’s first gas chamber with the power to kill on an industrial scale.”Next he reported on the creation of a new camp nearby, called Birkenau in German after the silver birch copses there. From the spring of 1942, trainloads of Jewish men, women and children arrived at Auschwitz to be gassed 35,000 would be killed that summer alone. Later he would write: “I would say that we have become animals … but no, we are a whole level of hell worse than animals.”The resistance in Warsaw passed on his reports to the Polish government in exile, and they begged the allies to act. The evidence that Auschwitz had become the “epicentre of a vast, mechanised genocide unparalleled in human history” was there. But neither Roosevelt nor Churchill “considered that the murder of Jews demanded a direct response”. Once, after the Polish government in exile had again asked the allies to consider bombing Auschwitz, a British diplomat said tetchily: “The Poles are being very irritating over this.”Journalist Jack Fairweather’s account of Pilecki’s bravery, endurance and humanity is the well deserved winner of the 2019 Costa biography award. As he says, Pilecki’s story is “essential for our understanding of how Auschwitz came into being”. The concentration camp was transformed into a death factory before Pilecki’s eyes. During nearly three years in Auschwitz, he risked his life to reveal the camp’s true horror. His heroic attempts to alert the world to what was happening were only fully revealed after the fall of the Soviet Union and the opening of the Polish state archives.Eventually Pilecki escaped from Auschwitz with two friends in April 1943. They travelled more than 100 miles on foot and Pilecki was shot in the shoulder by a German guard. Back in Warsaw he found that few people knew about the underground organisation he had created in Auschwitz and even fewer were aware of the camp’s role in the mass-murder of Jews.He wanted to lead an attack on the camp, but the resistance refused. When he discovered that the leaders of the underground he had formed back in the camp had all been shot “he was devastated”. He believed he had failed to convince people that what was happening in Auschwitz was “evil” and that there was a moral imperative to confront it.It wasn’t until the summer of 1944, when allied forces had landed on the beaches of Normandy and Soviet planes were above Warsaw, that western leaders acknowledged the significance of what was happening at Auschwitz. By then Pilecki had just completed his 10th report on the camp. Five thousand Jews a day were being gassed, so many that the crematoria couldn’t cope and there were giant funeral pyres of corpses.After the war, Pilecki returned to Warsaw to set up a new underground organisation hoping to liberate Poland from its new communist rulers. In March 1946 he returned to Auschwitz, which had just been turned into a permanent memorial: “He’d come looking for answers but found none.” Instead he turned to writing in order to understand what had happened. But Pilecki was forced to acknowledge “that the horrors of the camp might never be comprehensible, even to a prisoner like himself who had suffered within its walls”.The following year, he was arrested by the secret police and accused of treason. He was tortured and interrogated more than 150 times in six months: “He told them the truth, he told them lies, he told them what he thought they wanted to hear.”Eventually he signed a confession and appeared in Poland’s first Soviet-style show trials in March 1948, accused of being a traitor and of “threatening society and our wonderful youth”. During a break in the trial he had a brief conversation with his wife, Maria, telling her: “Auschwitz was just a game compared to this. I’m very tired. I want a swift conclusion.”Refusing to beg for forgiveness, he told the court: “I tried to live my life in such a fashion so that in my last hour, I would rather be happy than fearful. I find happiness in knowing that the fight was worth it.” He was executed with a bullet to the back of the head on 25 May 1948.Pilecki died believing he had failed. Yet as this compelling study of his remarkable life shows, he did more than anyone to reveal the true horror of the camp: “It was the allies that didn’t listen.”• The Volunteer is published by Ebury (RRP £7.99).

What most non-members don’t know is how many members have no clue which faction is which either. The shorthand “centrist”, “hard left” and “soft left” is deployed because life, itself, is short, but the common assumptions about each fail to explain almost anything about the way the contest is unfolding.Why, if the hard left was united and organised enough to see off every challenge to Jeremy Corbyn, did it struggle to choose a candidate, and observably fracture as soon Rebecca Long-Bailey’s campaign was under way? How has it found itself presenting someone with such a mild political hinterland as the only true-left name on the ballot? She didn’t join the party until 2010, and became an MP after a politically unremarkable career as a solicitor. Why did Clive Lewis, the obvious bridge between hard and soft, fail to make the ballot? How did the soft left, seen as the least reactive element of the compound, the emollient middle child, manage to get three candidates – Lisa Nandy, Emily Thornberry and Keir Starmer – on to the list? Why, if the centrists are so pragmatic and sensible, so all-about-the-win, did they hit upon Jess Phillips, a wildly impractical candidate who has now dropped out?It makes so little sense that we look for answers among the assorted personalities, and there are indeed plenty of reasons why Jon Lansman, John McDonnell and Len McCluskey might fall out. But that’s only a fragment of the story. Long-Bailey has emerged as the Corbyn-continuity candidate, endorsed by Momentum, with the heavy lifting of her campaign undertaken by Lansman. Unite has yet to endorse, but its support for Long-Bailey is considered inevitable. What’s emerging is a bid that is extremely well-organised in terms of data and resources and yet absolutely riven with internal strife, with former Corbyn and McDonnell staffers joining, then swiftly leaving camp RLB, after clashing with Lansman.The hurdles her campaign faces are threefold: first, Momentum is not a snug fit with long-standing hard-left groups such as the People’s Assembly, Stop the War and Socialist Action. It draws its members from the student movement and the political movement, the World Transformed, and it contains plenty who reject the first principle of the old school, which is obedience. (This was plain when members were balloted before the Momentum nomination, giving them only one choice: endorse Long-Bailey as leader and Angela Rayner as deputy, or don’t. Both were endorsed, but Rayner very narrowly so, and on a very low turnout.)Second, McDonnell – whom no one could call a traitor to the Corbyn project – is conspicuously failing to get behind the idea that Labour has only one possible successor in the wake of fractious relations with Unite in the runup to the election. Last, the hangover from Brexit has further shattered the hard-left coalition, as the internationalists in Another Europe is Possible got passionately behind Lewis, and are now ided themselves on whether to rally behind Starmer or Long-Bailey.The broader pro-Corbyn coalition is more fragile still. The support of the soft left – which accounts for most Labour members – was vital in Corbyn being elected leader. This has been completely erased, pincer-style, by both the centrists, who painted the era as a hard-left takeover, and the hard left, who were happy to take the credit. The soft left has always been decisive, and it is no longer boxed in by limited choice, as it was in 2015. At the grass roots, it is strongly leaning towards Starmer, and it is this, rather than any resurgence of the centre, which explains his early and consistent lead in all members’ polls. He is a highly recognisable figure to Labour activists, going back to the 1980s: anti-militant but also anti-triangulation, socialist but not purist, the antithesis of the career politician who came to define the 00s.Starmer has also attracted support from the right of the parliamentary party – Jenny Chapman, the former vice-chair of Progress and ex-MP for Darlington, is chair of his campaign. I don’t share the disquiet some on the left feel about that. It is entirely natural for some pragmatists to turn a blind eye to the radicalism of his politics of justice – environmental, social and economic – in response to the need for pluralism and effectiveness. It doesn’t mean he is wearing that radicalism for effect.The conundrum of the centre is fascinating. The least fissiparous group – it prides itself on its ability to stay united – it ought, in theory, to be the most effective. But its relentless focus on electability lands it at the assumption that the party exists to meet the rest of the country where it is, bang in the centre. Since this space has no ideological definition, this means accepting and trying to embody the dominant narrative. Before 2010, when the narrative was the centre’s own, it was able – via Progress and Labour First – to generate ideas, many of which were half-baked, but at least they existed.Trying to reach meaningful conclusions when “common sense” is defined by the political right is much more difficult, and leaves it with a slew of contradictory imperatives – it absolutely must have a mirror-Johnson, a “world queen”, a celebrity, a clown who is also fiscally credible, a leaver who is also a remainer, a working-class woman who can also appeal to the identities of Tony Blair’s politically homeless middle class, a fearless defender of the dispossessed who also accepts the need for austerity. The centrist conception of what the left leadership should look like is so complicated yet so shallow that, in a way, Phillips, who was doing an impossible job at least with gusto, was its best possible iteration. They could have ended up with Lorraine Kelly. Yet you can see in the warmth of the some other candidates as she stepped down that this was a hospital pass that few felt she deserved.It would be asinine to call for unity when I support Starmer (“we can all be friends, so long as we line up behind my guy”). Yet if we separate which of these isions are about power and which are about ideas, all these gulfs look more bridgable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddb77483d29cde2658630e1d9fffae3c5a3427f8/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d3843913ec94e99e7323ae8fec9f1aa","title":"north backed brexit feel costs tory mps","story":"Boris Johnson and his ministers have made huge promises for the United Kingdom after we leave the European Union next week, particularly for “the north” – that unfamiliar land which can now be mined for Tory votes, if no longer for coal.Conservative MPs elected in former Labour strongholds have pledged to “hunt like a pack” for infrastructure improvements – of which there has been no sign over the past decade of Tory government. The north is promised bounty from the “shared prosperity fund” – the cynically named, back-of-an-envelope replacement for EU structural funds, which for decades have invested billions in Britain’s regions to encourage economic revival.Transformation is promised for when Brexit is “done”, yet there is still no acknowledgement that the most severe economic threat to the north is Brexit itself.The risks highlighted by government impact assessments – which Theresa May was so reluctant to publish – remain, with the north and Midlands facing the greatest peril due to the significance of their trade with Europe. And the chancellor Sajid Javid’s insistence that Britain will erge from EU industrial and social standards puts the risk to the regional economy at the more serious levels calculated by those assessments.Blighted as many areas have been by job losses and severe public spending cuts, it is nevertheless a caricature to depict the north and Midlands as barely rebuilt since the mines, shipbuilding and other heavy industries were dismantled under the Thatcher government in the 1980s. Efforts have been made over three decades to regenerate deindustrialised areas – including investment, consistently, from the now-disappearing EU funds that are specifically targeted at deprived areas of Europe. British policy has been patchy, never enough, and was further undermined from 2010 by Tory governments withdrawing swathes of funding, and abolishing regional development agencies.Yet the modern industries that have been established during this period, of which car manufacturing is the strongest example, have based their operations on Britain being a member of the EU.These downturns would affect companies in all sectors, putting hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk – such as in the ceramics industry, which still directly employs 22,500 people, many in its traditional Staffordshire heartland. The new year has already delivered a bracing blow to 283 steelworkers in South Yorkshire, where Liberty Speciality Steels cited “issues around Brexit” among its difficulties when announcing the redundancies.Johnson’s new MPs have gushed about knocking on doors in Sedgefield, Blyth Valley and Redcar, and finding people impatient for the Brexit they voted for in 2016. But when the MPs talk to people involved professionally in their constituencies’ economic development, they will find them almost unanimously alarmed by the prospect of leaving the EU.In the north-east, the region’s CBI, Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses, Entrepreneurs’ Forum, Northern TUC, local authorities and its four universities signed up to a call for continued access to the single market – which seems impossible now – in order to lessen the economic damage.Nissan itself, which employs almost 8,000 people directly in Sunderland, gradually escalated the seriousness of its warnings, before saying emphatically last October that a no-deal Brexit would make its UK operation unviable. The day after Johnson’s election victory, a company spokeswoman said it is “still waiting for clarity on what the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU will look like”.The efforts of UK business organisations, trades unions and other experts to explain the EU’s benefits and the risks of leaving have been bulldozed by three-word slogans, preceded by years of misinformation, all gleefully fuelled by the current prime minister. He may never be held to account for that, or for his new pledges to the north, but as he now moves to get Brexit done, his promises are finally set to collide with reality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40a42a2299a6b44456b74732a4d05bedfced62e0/0_0_4979_2987/master/4979.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cfb1b6381e9a863be1c3e8e9cd91124","title":"teachers tell us if you think the planned pay rise is enough","story":"If you are a teacher working in England we would like to hear your thoughts on salaries in the profession In light of the government announcing plans to raise salaries for teachers in England, we’d like to find out whether this measure is enough to stop teachers leaving the profession.

Jonathan Simms had been diagnosed with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), a cruel and fatal neurodegenerative condition that gives sufferers an average of one year to live.After receiving the drug pentosan polysulfate, Jonathan lived for another 10 years, defying all medical expectations. The court ruling made medical history: until that point the drug had only ever been tested on animals, and the legal decision opened doors to treatment for other patients.Key to Don Simms’s success in the courts was that he had been able to access the latest medical research findings on his son’s disease online, which was how he heard about the new drug.It’s a story often retold by Graham Steel, a former vCJD patient advocate and long-time campaigner for open access science – the principle that academic research papers should be made freely available to everyone.Around the same time as the Simms case, Steel made it his mission to gather and disseminate relevant research papers to other vCJD sufferers after his brother, Richard, died from the disease. “That was 18 years ago,” he says. “Yet there are still the same barriers stopping people from reading about research – from learning about the treatment they need.”In other words, hiding research papers behind a subscription paywall – as is the case for an estimated two-thirds of all research – could be killing people. There are countless examples of how failure to share science openly can have a devastating impact on public health.It’s happening now: the outbreak of coronavirus in China prompted the director of the Wellcome Trust to call for medical findings to be shared freely and widely to prevent the spread of the disease and improve treatments for patients. “Access to the most up-to-date information based on the most robust data possible helps countries understand the likelihood of future spread of the virus,” he says. The consequences of keeping research locked away can be devastating. In 2015, a group of senior health researchers, including the chief medical officer of Liberia, published an open letter in the New York Times declaring that the Ebola pandemic that killed more than 2,200 people could have been prevented if it weren’t for paywalls, given that an article published in a subscription-only journal in 1982 had warned of the risk. But the journal’s closed access model meant the paper’s reach was limited: medics on the ground were not sufficiently warned and further research was not undertaken. So why is it taking so long to transition to making research content free? For one thing, the publishing community is yet to agree on how to fund such a system. If readers or the institutes they work under are no longer paying to access papers, profit must be made elsewhere – most commonly by charging the authors themselves a fee for the cost of publication.Others argue that the entire research community has been slow to transition because of a lack of interest or understanding. According to Steel, a common misconception remains that the general public has no need to access research, with some academics claiming that medical studies present complex findings that are at best useless to the common reader, and at worst misinterpreted.“There’s a lot of misinformation out there for ‘cyberchondriacs’ to find, but I would say: let the reader decide,” counters Steel. “By stopping patients from reading scientifically sound, peer-reviewed papers in full, you’re really just leaving them to nothing but the rubbish that exists online already.”But change is afoot. Starting this year, Wellcome will require any medical research it is funding which is considered to offer possible public health benefits to immediately be published on an approved open access platform. The wider open access movement has also shifted a gear since September 2018, when a group of European research funders unveiled Plan S: an initiative now backed by more than 20 public funding bodies across 13 different countries, including the UK’s public funding agency, UK Research and Innovation. According to the policy, researchers undertaking work financed by taxpayer money must make it available to read online for free at the point of publication.The deadline for this was recently extended from January 2020 to 2021, after smaller publishers complained that they would be unable to transition their business models in time. But Robert-Jan Smits, Plan S’s founder and former special envoy of open access for the European Commission, says this was the point. “Having a short deadline forced people into action: I threw a stone in the pond and as a result made not just some ripplings but mega waves.”While some resistance to the plan remains, and there are questions to be resolved about how the policy can work internationally, negotiators say they have witnessed a shift in attitude over the past few months. “For a long time the debates have have been around why open access is a good thing. By and large that is now accepted, and the discussion is centred around how we can make it work for everyone,” says Liam Earney, of research network consortium Jisc.Earney negotiates open access publishing deals that will help both publishers and academic bodies in the UK make the transition financially viable. He is confident an agreement will be reached: “It benefits everyone to work together.”He adds: “As governments make data-informed decisions that will impact the rest of the world, having research more easily available to policymakers can only be a good thing. The grand challenges that we are trying to address around climate change, countering false information and facts, will be better served if the best research – and crucially the data associated with it – is openly available.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/749606117f427ed866bc206c93c721e86c825704/0_171_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3315d3b4a5fc49b54fb6b60338fb4788","title":"do you have a favourite tree share your pictures and stories","story":"As part of a new series, we’d like you to tell us about your favourite tree and why it’s special to youAs deforestation continues to threaten green space around the world, and the ’s Christmas appeal launches to tackle it, we’d like to celebrate our trees.Outside of their ecological value, many of us have sentimental attachment to trees.

About 2,000 people responded saying they wanted to be considered for the assembly, and the 110 members were picked by computer.They come from all age brackets and their selection reflects a 2019 Ipsos Mori poll of how concerned the general population is by climate change, where responses ranged from not at all to very concerned. Of the assembly members, three people are not at all concerned, 16 not very concerned, 36 fairly concerned, 54 very concerned, and one did not know, organisers said.The selection process meant those chosen could include climate deniers or sceptics, according to Sarah Allan, the head of engagement at Involve, which is running the assembly along with the Sortition Foundation and the e-democracy project mySociety.“It is really important that it is representative of the UK population,” said Allen. “Those people, just because they’re sceptical of climate change, they’re going to be affected by the steps the government takes to get to net zero by 2050 too and they shouldn’t have their voice denied in that.”The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen:• Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest.• Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load.• Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.\u0026nbsp • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050.• Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels. The UK climate assembly differs from the French model in that it was commissioned by six select committees, rather than by the prime minister. Their views, which will be produced in a report in the spring, will be considered by the select committees but there is no guarantee any of the proposals will be taken up by government.Allen said it was rare for members of a citizens’ assembly to get locked into dissent. She pointed to the success of the Irish citizens’ assembly in 2016, which helped break the deadlock in the abortion debate. “This climate assembly is going to come up with recommendations that are going to be really invaluable in highlighting public preferences,” she said.Jim Watson, a professor of energy policy at University College London, is one of four experts who will guide the members of the public in their decision-making. He acknowledged the scale of the challenges they faced in finding solutions to reaching net zero by 2050, which he said was “a hell of a job”.As well as four experts to the assembly, a panel of advisers including representatives from the Confederation of British Industry, Trades Union Congress, National Farmers’ Union, environmental NGOs and renewable energy companies have helped provide the questions on which assembly members will be asked to give their views.The assembly will meet for the next four weekends. On the third weekend they will begin making decisions about ways to meet the net zero target.A spokeswoman for Extinction Rebellion, which is calling for the government to create and be led by the decisions of a citizens’ assembly on climate, said they welcomed the fact that such assemblies were being used in mainstream politics. “However, because it is not commissioned by the government it is not what we are looking for. We want something with real teeth, that has actual power to influence policy,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16ea6d27d059111e7dbff89c3dafb52355ecaff1/1288_59_2746_1648/master/2746.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76d4a5b06319cdeaecf7a32a8efb9225","title":"uk climate scientist corrects australian mp craig kellys blatant misrepresentation","story":"Prof Sandy Harrison tells the Liberal on his Facebook page that his misuse of her study should not go unchallengedA leading UK climate scientist has used the Facebook page of the MP Craig Kelly to correct his “blatant misrepresentation” of a study she co-authored on a 70,000-year history of bushfires in Australia.Kelly, a serial denier of climate change, has been using the 2011 study to claim rising CO2 in the atmosphere can’t be linked to Australia’s bushfire crisis, because the study had shown total area being burned was going down while CO2 is rising.But Prof Sandy Harrison told  Australia: “I am a working scientist and I do not routinely engage in arguments on social media, but I do not think that the misuse of scientific analyses should be allowed to go unchallenged.”Kelly picked a sentence in the study that said all regions of Australia had shown reduced fires “during the last 50 years”.Kelly wrote: “Yet again, the truth is the exact opposite of the Alarmist narrative peddled in the media and swallowed, hook line \u0026amp sinker by the naive and gullible.”But Harrison, of the University of Exeter, told  Australia the study was about historical changes, and “not about the modern situation”.She said: “The paper explicitly shows that climate warming intervals in the geologic record are characterised by more fire, all other things being equal, and thus demonstrates exactly the opposite to Mr Kelly’s claim.”“Specifically, in many regions of the world, including Australia, human transformation of the landscape through the introduction of agriculture and infrastructure results in reduced fire spread and a reduced burnt area.”She said a reduction in burnt area over the last 50 years “does not negate the fact that climate warming is going to lead to increases”.She said that “landscape fragmentation” had been countering the impact of global warming on the spread of fires, but added “the number of large and intense fires has gone up”.In her comment on Kelly’s Facebook post, she addresses Kelly directly, telling him his “reading of the science is partial”.Her comment reads: “The controls on fire are complex, but two things we know for certain are that other things being equal increased temperature lead to increased fires. Hence, since increasing atmospheric CO2 leads (amongst other things) to increased temperature, the ongoing climate changes we are experiencing will lead to increased fire.“It is, alas, not difficult to predict what will happen if politicians continue to take a partial and prejudiced view of the science. They will continue to ignore the fact that the evidence shows that, even if there has been a reduction in area burnt in the recent historical periods, there has been an increase in fire frequency and severity associated with human-induced climate change. And that the risk of catastrophic fires will continue to increase.”She added: “As a scientist, my job is to tell you the facts. Your job is to act on them.”Kelly has been prolific in his Facebook attacks on the “climate alarmist cult” and the “prophets of doom” in the past few weeks.In the past 24 hours, Kelly has posted six times, attacking climate campaigners at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland as “prophets of doom”, promoting Donald Trump’s attack on alarmists, attacking environment activist group Greenpeace, and other posts claiming “fake climate news”.Senior government MPs have tried to distance themselves from Kelly’s views, after he gave an interview earlier this month on the UK’s Good Morning Britain show in which he was described as a “denier”.While Australia continues to be devastated by bushfires, Kelly has launched angry attacks on climate scientists, often in all caps.On 3 January, Kelly linked to a blog by a UK group known as Principia Scientific International, which has previously claimed that CO2 is not a greenhouse gas.Responding to Harrison’s comments, Kelly has given interviews defending his statement, and repeating his original points. On Facebook he called the study an “inconvenient fact for the climate alarmist cult” and said the responses to it had been “pathetic”.Kelly wrote: “These researchers should be out their attempting to correct the harmful myth held by climate cultists – yet they appear too frightened to admit the facts of their own research.”In defending his original post, he pointed to another study by Prof Stefan Doerr, who is currently the editor in chief of the International Journal of Wildfire.But last week Doerr joined colleagues to carry out a “rapid review” of the science on bushfires, saying: “The fact that fires are increasing in areas within or near closed canopy forest is the key issue of concern. This is one of the land cover types where direct impact on societies is greatest.“It is also important to highlight that most studies predict increased lightning activity in a warming atmosphere, which further exacerbates wildfire risk.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50d3167d91be28c193217562f7f0f79c1948fa0b/0_0_2837_4256/master/2837.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a9928b22594f4cca6c8cd6bbbb568a7e 1400w","title":"everton newcastle united premier league match report","story":"Carlo Ancelotti clasped his hands to his chest in sheer disbelief. He was not alone. The Everton manager has inherited a team with a reputation for throwing points away but this was a spectacular and staggering implosion even by their standards. Two goals up in the 94th minute, in complete control against a Newcastle team devoid of attacking intent or options, yet held to a draw thanks to two goals in the final seconds from Florian Lejeune.Steve Bruce cavorted on to the pitch in celebration of the heist before offering a sheepish handshake to his counterpart. “I lost the final of the Champions League after being 3-0 up,” the former Milan manager said. “So it can happen sometimes.” It seems to happen to Everton frequently.The hosts were cruising towards a third win in three home Premier League games until a chaotic finale fuelled by weak goalkeeping from Jordan Pickford, poor game management, careless defending and Newcastle’s refusal to concede defeat.The tale should have been one of redemption for Moise Kean, the 19-year-old striker who scored his first Everton goal in his 22nd appearance for the club and produced a display that earned a standing ovation from the Goodison Park crowd.The match also provided another demonstration of Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s growing prowess as he scored his 12th goal of the campaign but it will be remembered for Everton conspiring to find another ridiculous way to squander points, confidence and momentum.At 2-0 down Bruce introduced defenders Lejeune and Fabian Schar to audible grumbles from the away section. “Do you think I really wanted to do that?” the Newcastle manager asked. “We’ve got nothing else.” Both were asked to play out of position and Everton could not handle the extra physical presence that muscled into their penalty area at set-pieces.Pickford failed to deal with a 94th-minute corner that resulted in Lejeune scoring with an acrobatic overhead kick. It should have been no more than an impressive consolation. But Everton offered Newcastle a second bite by conceding possession and cheap free-kick. Ancelotti’s substitutes, Oumar Niasse and Tom Davies, were both culpable and after Schar plus Isaac Hayden both threatened Pickford’s goal, Lejeune forced the ball over the line with the England keeper standing yards behind it.“There’s no disputing we were second best for long periods and it was a real struggle but we hung on in there,” Bruce said. “We lack in certain areas but you can not fault their fight or endeavour.”Ancelotti took consolation in Everton’s overall performance, much improved on recent showings, and the contribution of Kean but he should note that the lapses that cost his team victory are a recurring theme with this group of players. “It is true we could have stayed more focused on set pieces and it’s true we could have been more focused in the last minutes but I think the team played a fantastic game for all 90 minutes,” he said.One of his many considerable tasks as the Everton manager is to nurture the raw talent that prompted the club to pay up to £29m for Kean in the summer. The Italian continued that process by handing his young compatriot only the fifth start of a difficult debut Premier League season and Kean repaid that faith with a fully committed display. His first Everton goal was a merited reward.The breakthrough for the teenager and Everton owed plenty to the ingenuity of Bernard. The Brazilian took possession midway in the Newcastle half after Calvert-Lewin flicked on Djibril Sidibé’s searching ball. He released Kean with a deft lob over the visiting defence and, though the striker’s first touch gave Hayden chance to intervene, a sharp finish with his second touch beat both the wing-back and Martin Dubravka. Kean understandably erupted in joy, sliding on his knees in front of the Gwladys Street, while Ancelotti responded with a thumbs-up to the goalscorer.Calvert-Lewin provided the cushion of a two-goal lead when Lucas Digne threaded a perfect pass into his stride in the second half. Jamaal Lascelles was unable to intercept at full stretch and the Everton centre-forward, his England credentials extolled by Ancelotti on the eve of the game, swept it inside the far post.Everton wracked up a procession of chances for a third with Calvert-Lewin, Yerry Mina and Mason Holgate all going close. A foul by Calvert-Lewin on Emil Krafth appeared to result in a mobile phone being thrown on to the pitch but that was the least of Everton’s problems when Lejeune suddenly, inexplicably, transformed the game in the dying seconds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b229bf0f04602dbee8f4e6d60f82a6de97ab0cc4/0_4_2739_1643/master/2739.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b91193227c29ca51785bc1682b93f10","title":"sheffield united manchester city premier league match report","story":"Sergio Agüero came off the bench to restore normal service for Manchester City, securing a win with a sharply taken goal when the defending champions appeared in danger of being held for a second game in succession.Certainly before Agüero’s introduction there had been little to choose between the sides, which is as much a compliment to Sheffield United as a criticism of City’s performance. And then there was Gabriel Jesus’s first-half penalty, saved by Dean Henderson. The striker has been unsuccessful with all three penalties he has taken for club and country this season, and if Pep Guardiola is going to persist with using Agüero sparingly he may like to consider giving someone else a turn from the spot.“I am definitely going to reflect on it,” the City manager said. “It’s not just Jesus, Agüero and Sterling have missed too, and in tight games like these penalties can make a big difference. We knew this was a tough place to come but we put in a solid performance and the big plus was the performance of Aymeric Laporte. I think he is the best left-sided central defender in the world, and when a player like that is out for five months you are bound to miss him.”City welcomed back Laporte a few days earlier than anticipated and nearly lost him again after a mere 12 minutes when Mo Besic was booked for an untidy challenge that left the defender in a heap, though after receiving attention he was able to continue. City retained Fernandinho in a back three to match up with the home side’s formation, yet United almost found a way through in the opening minutes when Oli McBurnie played Billy Sharp behind the City backline. United briefly held a numerical advantage but Sharp was unable to pick out John Fleck with his cross.It was United’s turn to get lucky midway through the first half when Chris Basham miscontrolled on halfway to leave Raheem Sterling sprinting clear. The winger supplied Riyad Mahrez on the right and moved up to meet the return pass with a first-time shot, only to see Henderson e to his right to save.While it was a good stop by the goalkeeper United had been opened up, and from a position near the penalty spot a more accomplished finisher, Agüero say, might have scored. Henderson came to his side’s rescue again just minutes later, when Nicolás Otamendi came up for a corner and managed to improvise an aerial volley that stayed low and on target but was kept out by the goalkeeper’s legs.Henderson’s finest moment was still to come, because 10 minutes before the interval the goalkeeper on loan from Manchester United kept out the penalty. City had perhaps been a tad fortunate to see it awarded. Mahrez appeared to be losing control of the ball on a slalom through a crowded area by the time Basham arrived to bring his progress to an abrupt halt. With Agüero on the bench Jesus stepped up to take the kick and put it at a comfortable height for Henderson to save. The goalkeeper was a yard off his line when the ball was struck and VAR could theoretically have ordered the kick to be retaken but as applause for Henderson’s heroics were still ringing round the ground as the game restarted the officials wisely opted not to start a riot.The home crowd were incensed enough by half-time as it was, after seeing Ollie Norwood booked for a foul on Fernandinho when the City player had already got away with a couple of similar tactical offences without punishment.By the time the Brazilian did receive a caution, right on the stroke of the interval, he almost appeared to be asking Lee Mason to take action by piling into McBurnie from behind with no chance of winning the ball.The travelling support had been singing Agüero’s name for some time before he was sent on with 23 minutes remaining. The effect was close to immediate, for with 17 minutes left the visitors were in front. All it took was one measured Kevin De Bruyne pass, expertly placed between Jack O’Connell and John Egan, and a typically well-timed Agüero run to meet the ball and tap it home. United would have been doubly aggrieved because, moments before, McBurnie had narrowly failed to connect with a similarly inviting cross from Enda Stevens after Kyle Walker had lost the ball, though replays gave the impression a goal might not have passed a VAR offside test.“When top sides come here we want them to go through the mixer to get a result,” Chris Wilder said. “We went toe to toe with City and that’s something to be proud of but they have real quality and they won through a world-class pass and a fabulous finish.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80e3a2b96f64d95aa81b970946ff4c5ec31b50dd/0_0_4641_2785/master/4641.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef974091ab96bb135ec479e37a451422","title":"david luiz arsenal chelsea red card philsophical matters","story":"An encouraging display at Chelsea poses a question: is no David Luiz a more effective defensive tool than David Luiz?They laughed at the idea David Luiz might bring spirit and a fighting mentality to this Arsenal team. Well, he found a way here.Not the orthodox way. Rather, in a way that involved removing himself from the pitch for 64 minutes of this slightly wild 2-2 draw, the opening act in one of the more robust and indeed quietly encouraging Arsenal performances at Stamford Bridge of recent years.In the process Arsenal’s defence posed an interesting philosophical question. Could it be the case that a David Luiz-shaped hole, the absence of David Luiz, is more defensively resilient than the actual, material David Luiz? Is the hypothetical David Luiz, an entity best expressed as (David Luiz – David Luiz) more effective as a defensive rallying point than the real thing?What is certain is that on a ground where Arsenal have in the past been alarmingly supine they recovered from losing a man, equalised twice and showed further signs of the kind of rigour Mikel Arteta has been working to instil.This is of course the real story here. Red cards aside, Arsenal’s manager will be heartened by the performance in the final hour. Arteta played in the infamous 6-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge, the first of those gruelling collapses of the late-Wenger endgame. The future is still wide open but something was gained here, something cast off.It is a story that begins, as it must, with The Incident. David Luiz’s game in numbers: 26 minutes, two fouls, four inaccurate long balls. Almost all of that time was taken up in a bruising duel with Tammy Abraham.David Luiz’s first act was to punch and kick Abraham to the ground, leaving him clutching the small of his back. It is an underrated David Luiz trait, in among the crossfield punts, the dribbles, the flowing mane. He’s also a solid B+ clogger.For a while this was a good battle, one that favoured the younger man when he could stretch his legs and gallop free. And then it happened. Shkodran Mustafi was David Luiz’s enabler. As the ball bounced in midfield Mustafi attempted a backpass. It was a truly terrible pass, not just badly executed, but badly conceived too, with Abraham reading it in an instant.The Chelsea man pounded off in pursuit. The Chelsea fans began to rise, feeling something strange, the inverse of all their own David Luiz moments, the other side of this thing. So this is how it feels. Thank you, thank you Shkodran, for this moment of healing.David Luiz thundered back, Abraham nicked the ball around Bernd Leno. The tackle when it came wasn’t cunning or “professional”. It was instead wholeheartedly doomed, a slide from behind that brought to mind one of those Hollywood westerns where some unsmiling sheriff splinters his way through the saloon doors with a single punch.Stuart Attwell pointed to the spot. Seconds later there was an even bigger cheer as the red card was brandished. In that moment the whole tableau almost felt a little obvious, a little cheesy, like an at-Wembley-stadium final tour bonanza, the Eagles creaking into their 10,000th calloused rendition of Hotel California. Really? This again?There was a circularity too. David Luiz’s last red card came here in a blue shirt in the same fixture three years ago. More notable, these are David Luiz’s only two Premier League red cards. This is an extraordinary achievement given the sheer volume of fouls and oddities in that time.Perhaps it’s also evidence of some improvement as a defender. He was at least in the right place to hack his man down from behind.As Jorginho slotted away the penalty the narrative seemed set. The hope with David Luiz had always been that his best qualities – leadership, physicality, a winning mentality – could be soldered on to the Arsenal exoskeleton. At times it has seemed the opposite is happening. Arsenal-ness has been injected into the veins of David Luiz like some banned laboratory experiment, creating a potentially fatal super-David Luiz.Something has shifted though. True, this was David Luiz’s third penalty concession of the season, more than any other player in the league. True, the teamsheet had suggested the depth of Arteta’s task, a triple-bolt of David Luiz, Mustafi and Granit Xhaka promising all the impenetrable defensive resilience of a bead curtain. But there has been a sense of the stitching being pulled a little tighter.Here Arteta was up on his feet repeatedly, screaming at his players for failing to track overlaps on the flanks. Arteta wants clarity, tight spaces, units playing in concert all over the pitch like men roped together on a mountain.And steadily they marched their way back into this game. Gabriel Martinelli ran 60 metres in a dead straight line and finished beautifully. César Azpilicueta scored after a moment of defensive brain fade, only for Héctor Bellerín to curl in an improbable equaliser with his left foot. Chelsea were poor at Stamford Bridge.But Arteta will take encouragement from the point and from the feeling, once again, of shapes being formed, of a structure struggling to assert itself, solidifying here around that David Luiz-shaped hole."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0829d774d9f26248946b1df7e2b4cb3bacf9e93/0_89_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4e6f23472af9a55d7faf9e62650655a","title":"what happens when we dont believe women","story":"Not listening to women’s experience of abusive men – and of other areas from health to the economy – harms all of society It’s become a grim ritual among the women I know: as soon as there is news of another mass shooting, we wait to hear the inevitable story about the shooter’s history of hurting women. (The shooter is always a man.) Sometimes he’s been violent to his mother or grandmother. More often, police reports reveal his history of abusing his girlfriend or wife.But almost always he practiced his violence on a woman long before he planned his massacre, and within a day of the slaughter we’re sharing this history with impotent grief, asking again and again, what will it take to take women’s lives seriously? If we took women’s lives seriously, if men who abused the women in their lives faced any kind of real consequences, would the people we are now preparing to bury be alive today?That’s a complicated question, tangled up with gun politics and our failed criminal justice system. But the core reality remains stark: it’s impossible to contain the suffering that stems from discounting and disbelieving women.If we refused to accept the daily suffering of women and girls at the hands of men who claim to love them, we would have a federal policy removing guns from abusers, and we would ensure that it worked in practice. And we would have a lot fewer gun deaths. Period.It’s vile to have to make this argument. It should be enough that women are hurt. But it’s not. Women’s pain is expected, part of the wallpaper of life. In her indelible essay “The female price of male pleasure,” Lili Loofbourow points to the chasm between what men and women define as “bad sex” to illuminate this basic fact of modern culture: if men find a sexual encounter boring or unsatisfying, they call it “bad”.But we’re not. And when you don’t listen to us, we’re not the only ones who pay the price. Our national failure to take women seriously is a public health crisis, and not just because of bad guys with guns.Take, for example, the medical establishment’s long-documented refusal to take women at our word about the symptoms we’re experiencing. Whether we’re suffering from acute and chronic pain, mysterious weight loss or gain, neuromuscular conditions, or depression and anxiety, we’re suspected of being melodramatic, told that all we need is an attitude adjustment and some self-care.The result? Increased healthcare costs, lost workplace productivity, and the worst maternal death rate in the developed world. This last cost is borne disproportionately by black women, who are treated as even less trustworthy than white women. And mistrusting black women has this massive public health cost as well: if Congress and President Clinton had listened to black women in the reproductive justice movement in 1994, we could have fixed our healthcare system decades ago.Or consider that if we could simply all agree to believe trans women that they exist and are the experts on their own gender identity, the sky-high rates of murder and suicide in the trans community (a recent study found that trans girls have nearly double the suicide attempts of their cis girl peers) would surely be reduced, as would the elevated rates of housing and job discrimination, sexual violence, and street harassment they are currently forced to suffer.Imagine the lives and livelihoods that would have been saved if we had listened to Brooksley Born. In 1996, as the new head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, she realized that the derivatives market, if left unchecked, would eventually cause a catastrophic economic collapse. She spent years trying to get powerful men like then-Fed-chair Alan Green and treasury secretary Robert Rubin to help her sound the alarm. Instead, they fought her every step of the way, until she finally gave up on them and released a report about her predictions on her own. It was ignored and derided by the powers that be. A decade later, the very dynamics she warned against caused the Great Recession.The list seems endless. If we trusted poor women, we wouldn’t withhold aid from their kids to prevent them from procreating as some kind of “scam”, and poor kids would grow up with better nutrition, more stable family dynamics, and better education. If we trusted women to make their own reproductive decisions, we would have unfettered access to safe, reliable birth control and abortion care, and that would likely decrease poverty levels, improve women’s mental and physical health, and create better outcomes for the children they choose to have.Consider how brief and unimportant the Flint water crisis could have been if Michigan officials had trusted the mothers of Flint when they said their water was suddenly undrinkable. How many kids would have grown up without lead exposure? What could those kids have achieved without the lifelong cognition problems and emotional challenges that can result from childhood lead poisoning?And of course, any discussion of the public health costs of disbelieving women must address itself to Hillary Clinton. It was so hard for voters – including white women – to believe in Clinton as a leader that we are all now suffering through the age of Trump. One chilling experiment suggests that the simple fact of Clinton’s gender could have cost her as much as eight points in the general election.We don’t need science to tell us that it was more believable to almost 63 million US voters that Trump, a man who had never held a single public office, who had been sued almost 1,500 times, whose businesses had filed for bankruptcy six times and who had driven Atlantic City into decades-long depression, a race-baiting misogynist leech of a man who was credibly accused of not only of sexual violence but also of defrauding veterans and teachers out of millions of dollars via Trump University, would be a good president than it was to imagine that Clinton, a former first lady, senator and secretary of state and arguably the most qualified person to ever run, would be a better leader.It is not an exaggeration to suggest that every public health impact the Trump administration is having on us – and the list is long and includes making quality healthcare access less accessible for millions, enabling rapists to roam free of consequences on American campuses, and literally speeding up catastrophic climate change by pulling out of the Paris accords – can be linked to our stubborn unwillingness to believe a woman about her own competence, or even just her assertion that a man is dangerous.The truth underlying the public health crisis of women’s believability is even worse than it looks. That’s because social researchers have long demonstrated that it’s not just that we hold women to much higher standards than we do men before we believe them. It’s more perverse than that: we prefer not finding women credible. As a culture, we hate to believe women, and we penalize them for forcing us to do so.In other words, as women’s credibility increases, especially in ways that defy gender norms, their social likability decreases. They become shrill bitches, ball busters, too aggressive, too bossy, such intolerable know-it-alls. It is not enough that we demand women clear a much higher bar than men do to prove their trustworthiness. It’s that we’re mad when they manage to succeed anyway. And we’re all paying the price for that anger.Some of the losses are literally immeasurable. I know of no woman who doesn’t house inside her the nagging feeling that maybe what she has to say is not that important, or will cause too much trouble, or will put her in danger. I know of no woman who has not at least some of the time allowed that feeling to prevail, to smother her impulse to speak. I am haunted by the losses to humanity those infinite silences represent.What inventions and innovations are we suffering without? What tragedies proceeded un-prevented? What kindness and community are we starving for that we could be sustained by, had women not silenced ourselves? For that matter, what offerings could we be benefiting from if women simply didn’t have to work so hard to prove our credibility to ourselves and others? How many hours of our lives have been stolen from us in this way?And yet still today, how many women does it take to overcome the credibility of one man? It took 60 for sexual abuse allegations to become credible against Bill Cosby. For Harvey Weinstein to be credibly accused of sexual harassment and assault, the number is more like 80. For some, we have yet to find the number. Over a dozen accused Donald Trump of sexual assault and he is still the president of the United States as of this writing.Ultimately, the systemic disbelief of women is less about actually seeing women as untrustworthy, and more about fearing what happens if we are able to step into our full power. Not that this distinction matters in practice: do anti-abortion activists really think women are so easily duped by doctors, or is it just more convenient for them to blame “doctors” and posit women as frail-minded and in need of protection than it is to admit that they just want to dictate what we do with our own bodies? Do we not believe that trans women know themselves better than we do, or do we just fear how destabilizing it is to admit that gender is a construct? The damage is done either way.But it’s important to understand how deeply rooted this dynamic is. As has been observed of many oppressive institutions, the delegitimization of women’s authority isn’t the unfortunate side-effect of a broken framework. It’s the grease that makes the entire system go. Women’s erasure is an essential part of the deal powerful men have always made with the men they would have power over: let me have control over you, and in turn I will ensure you can control women. It’s the same bargain white women make when they support misogynist white men in power: if I acquiesce to you demeaning me because of my gender, you will at least allow me to demean others because of their race.But those who refuse to take women seriously rarely admit – to themselves even – what they’re really defending. Instead, they often imagine they have more “rational” concerns. Won’t innocent men be falsely accused? Will women have too much power? Can we really assume women are infallible? These are less questions than straw men, a sleight of hand trick drawing our focus to a shadowy boogeywoman who will take everything you hold dear if you don’t constrain her with your distrust.There is one meaningful way in which the fearmongers are right. Because the existing power structure is built on female subjugation, female credibility is inherently dangerous to it. Patriarchy is called that for a reason: men really do benefit from it. When we take seriously women’s experiences of sexual violence and humiliation, men will be forced to lose a kind of freedom they often don’t even know they enjoy: the freedom to use women’s bodies to shore up their egos, convince themselves they are powerful and in control, or whatever other uses they see fit. When we genuinely believe in women’s leadership capacity, men must face twice the competition they previously had to contend with. And none of us, whatever our gender, are immune from the tremors that can come when the assumptions at the foundation our social contracts are upended.But while we’re constantly obsessed with how risky it is to trust women, what we most of the time fail to consider is the cost of our ongoing mistrust, the cost of missing out on the unfettered power of women. A world in which we treat women as de facto credible is not a world in which men are doing women a favor. It’s a world in which everyone benefits from women’s increased power and knowledge and talent, one in which we recognize that addressing women’s suffering makes it more possible for people of every gender to thrive. The data bear this out in every sector: when girls and women have access to secondary education, their communities and future children have better outcomes. When women are well-represented in the top management of companies, those businesses do better. Even movies that pass the Bechdel test do better at the box office than movies that fail it.Seeing women as fully human may cost men certain kinds of oppressive power, but it pays idends to the human race in nearly every other way. It should be enough to believe in women simply because it’s better for women. But for every time it isn’t, remember this: the costs of disbelieving us are astronomical, and no one escapes the bill.From Believe: How Trusting Women Can Change the World (28 January, Seal Press), an anthology edited by Jaclyn Friedman and Jessica Valenti"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/757c23d8121b08eb86d6fc285a13a63b9dd0ad09/0_21_3828_2297/master/3828.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93ba57766552f0d10ae53d6c71e08150","title":"ethos hotel oxford emergency help out of hours","story":"I had an appalling experience at a four-star hotel in Oxford in November. I’d booked a room at the Ethos Hotel through Booking. Around midnight we were woken by water dripping through a light fixture in the ceiling. There was no landline and no mobile phone signal. Reception, across the road in a different building, was locked. I dialled the hotel number from the street and was answered by a call centre in Cheshire. The operative initially said nothing could be done, then tried to call the US-based hotel proprietor who didn’t answer. After much discussion he used Googlemaps to direct me on a five-minute walk to a flat in the next street where the duty manager lived. It was unsettling knocking on a stranger’s door in the freezing cold in the middle of the night. No one answered. I had no choice but to return to the room and try to sleep while the water dripped. The next morning I raised the issue with the receptionist who said it was beyond her remit and that I should email the proprietor in the US. I did and received an apology for the “inconvenience” and offering a free upgrade and one free night if I booked a two-night stay in the future. It did not address the key issue that there was no out-of-hours contact. What if there had been an emergency? I am astonished that a four-star hotel can get away with such behaviour.Managing director Simon Walshaw’s response is prompt, defensive and inclined to apportion blame to you. He insists there is always an emergency contact located in the flat that you were sent to, but that, unknown to him, the member of staff on duty that night was knocked out by prescription pills for stress and failed to hear you at the door.He denies it takes as long as five minutes to walk to the flat and accuses you of “taking an instant dislike” to the manager on duty the following morning, claiming that your “screaming and shouting” demands to know why no one had been available frightened her into defensiveness.He claims that the leak was caused by loose sealant on the shower above your room and that it was fixed during breakfast. And he details his altruistic support of staff.“The reason for the issue was the extenuating circumstances of our employee and her new medication,” he says unapologetically.“However, in light of this incident, we are reviewing our internal procedures, and will implement a more reliable system so that this never happens again.” These “extenuating” circumstances were not mentioned in the initial apology emailed to you, nor were the allegations, which you deny, that you intimidated the receptionist.It’s unclear how guests are supposed to know of the staff flat when it has no sign and is not mentioned on the website or check-in details and when the out-of-hours number connects to a Cheshire call centre.An Ethos Hotel reviewer on Tripadvisor states that she had to find another hotel at 1am when she could not get her room pass to work and could not get help. Other reviews, months before your stay, mention shabby bathrooms and elderly sealant which explains the leak you experienced.Booking takes a more sympathetic approach. “Having been made aware of this customer’s experience, we sympathise fully and have offered a full refund as a gesture of goodwill,” it says. “We have also removed this property pending an investigation.” If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

Two years of parliamentary warfare over Brexit had left deep scars on the personal relationships that once formed the glue for Corbyn’s radical political project.Speaking to many of the leading figures in Labour’s election campaign, a picture emerges of tactical spats, mixed messages and frayed tempers – not least Corbyn’s own.Many of the senior players were the same as in 2017 – the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, chaired the daily 7.30am calls to set the agenda for the day ahead the policy chief, Andrew Fisher, oversaw the manifesto the former Corbyn aide Karie Murphy led the operational side of the campaign, and Milne was in charge of strategy and communications. Jennie Formby, handpicked by Corbyn to be Labour’s general secretary, oversaw management and budgets.Yet this group had been on different sides in the painful dispute about Labour’s Brexit stance – McDonnell and Fisher were instrumental in helping to persuade Corbyn that backing a second referendum was the only way of safeguarding the leftwing political movement they had built. By contrast, Milne and Murphy – as well as the Unite union’s chief of staff, Andrew Murray, and the Corbynite PR Steve Howell, both of whom sat on the election strategy group – believed that fateful decision would cost Labour dear in leave-supporting seats.And this difference of analysis continued to reverberate throughout the campaign. There was a strongly held perception in Labour’s HQ at the outset that Labour still had more work to do to pacify remain voters, after its switch to backing a second referendum.As for leave voters, many of whom were heavily concentrated in a swath of Labour-held seats being targeted by the Tories, the plan was to change the subject – focusing as much as possible on other issues, including public services and the NHS.“It felt like the People’s Vote campaign in there,” said one senior member of the campaign team, who recalled being warned, in respect of Labour leave voters: “We don’t want to prod the beast!”Howell, who had overseen Labour’s digital campaigning in 2017 and was brought in this time to look at targeting and polling, was alarmed by the prevalence of the view that Labour could win by focusing on remainers.He and other sceptics about Labour’s shift towards a referendum always felt it was fruitless to try to skirt the issue. “In the end, you can’t just fight a battle and ignore your opponent. You can’t just say: ‘We’re fighting at sea’, if your opponent is mounting a land invasion,” said one party strategist. Even Labour’s attack line on the NHS – focusing on the risk that it would be handed to Donald Trump as part of a trade deal – had an anti-Brexit undertone to it. And focusing on austerity, which still featured heavily in Corbyn’s stump speeches, was perhaps a less potent weapon against a Tory party that had ditched Philip Hammond’s rigid fiscal discipline.“That was one of the things that we were a bit caught on the hop about: Boris suddenly started throwing austerity overboard. He had deprived us of our core message,” said the adviser.Labour’s approach to targeting was almost a mirror image of 2017’s. Then, Corbyn and his lieutenants blamed the excessive caution of party officials for blunting their attacking edge.This time, they began with an ambitious list of 96 targets – 66 of which were attacking seats, and 30 defensive.That was partly because the job of any opposition is to get into government, and it would have appeared defeatist to target fewer seats than Labour needed for a majority.But the campaign team also hoped some of the magic that propelled them to such a close result in 2017 would spark the campaign into life again: the rousing rallies, Corbyn’s comfortable-in-his-own-skin authenticity, Tory missteps. “We were all too hypnotised by our achievement in 2017, and we thought that however bad the situation was, once the campaign got going we would catch up,” said one party source.Some events – including an upbeat launch at Battersea Arts Centre, and the unveiling of the manifesto at Birmingham City University, where Corbyn held the document triumphantly aloft against a dark pink backdrop – almost recaptured the buzz of two years earlier. But veterans of that election remarked that the crowds in 2019 were generally smaller this time, and failed to build as the weeks went on.Labour’s manifesto itself was a casualty of the fractious working relationships that dogged the campaign. Milne was widely viewed internally as the most important single decision-maker in the 2017 campaign. But this time, a day before the crucial clause V meeting at which the manifesto was to be signed off, he had not seen the final printed version.Key policies had been thrashed out in discussions, including among the strategy group – but Fisher’s policy team kept a firm hold on the finished document, and his relationship with Milne had been badly frayed by the Brexit battle.“No one really knew what was coming until it emerged, from a process only really accessible to Andrew Fisher and John McDonnell,” said one Labour source. “And so major policies were coming out – free broadband, Waspi women – which really nobody knew was coming.” But Labour’s policy wonks insist they were just doing what they could to fill the hole where they felt an electoral strategy should have been. Unlike in 2017, policy and strategy were working in silos.The general election was Fisher’s final job for Corbyn, after he resigned in September, with an email leaked to the Sunday Times in which he gave a blistering critique of Labour’s incompetence, including what he called “a blizzard of lies and excuses” about the party’s failure to come up with a strapline for its conference until the last minute.The same indecision dogged Labour’s election slogan. “It’s Time for Real Change” was meant as a riposte to Johnson’s phoney claim to be offering a fresh start for Britain, but was the outcome of a fraught debate, including external consultants and focus grouping, and as such was little loved by anyone.As the campaign went on, and anxiety increased at the risks Labour faced in defensive seats, “Labour Is On Your Side” took over – though one insider laments with hindsight that voters in leave seats who felt the party had betrayed them over Brexit appear to have been moved to respond with “fuck off”.The “grid”, overseen by the combative Murphy, and discussed at a 10am daily meeting, was packed with policy announcements: but there was scant sense of a theme or direction for each week or phase of the campaign.“They had all these policies drafted and waiting, and that would lead the grid – a different policy announcement every day,” said one member of the campaign team. “I think it was pretty obvious that there was a lot of throwing a lot of stuff at a lot of walls and hoping it would stick.”As the campaign went on, and reports flooded into the Victoria HQ from anxious candidates in defensive seats, those who had always believed Brexit was Labour’s overriding challenge felt increasingly vindicated – and alarmed.On Sunday 24 November, about halfway through, the strategy group met to review how things were going – and agreed it was necessary to make more of a pitch to leavers – and to resource defensive seats more generously.As a result, Howell recommended adding another 16 seats to the target list, and it was decided to ask Labour’s regional directors for more recommendations – a process that resulted in a further 21 seats being put on the list, taking the total to more than 130, though not all of those were fully resourced.The group also decided to focus more on Labour’s bread-and-butter offer to working-class voters in leave-supporting communities – including giveaways such as free prescriptions and social care – and to extend the party chairman Ian Lavery’s campaigning Brexit bus tour.But in the event, much of the following week was overshadowed by Labour’s record on tackling antisemitism. On Tuesday, as the party prepared to launch its race and faith manifesto, the Times splashed with a letter from the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, claiming Corbyn’s handling of allegations of anti-Jewish racism meant he was “unfit for high office”.At the Bernie Grant Arts Centre in Tottenham that morning, Corbyn was more than half an hour late for the race and faith event, and the MP Dawn Butler filled the time by reciting the lyrics to the Labi Siffre classic (Something Inside) So Strong, to a bemused audience of hacks, who bombarded Labour aides with questions and requests. Until the last moment, it was unclear whether she and Corbyn would take questions from journalists.Later that day, the Labour leader recorded a pre-planned interview with Andrew Neil. Corbyn was at his most petulant, as the broadcaster challenged him to apologise over antisemitism, grumpily interjecting “will you let me finish?” – a clip of which found its way on to that week’s Have I Got News for You.Colleagues say that throughout the campaign Corbyn was keener to be personally involved in day-to-day decisions than in 2017 – and grumpier, sometimes even angry if he felt his views had been disregarded.Labour tried to use a moment of political theatre to seize back the agenda the next day, by staging a press conference where Corbyn dramatically held aloft a 400-plus page leaked dossier suggesting the government was ready to put the NHS up for sale. “These uncensored documents leave Boris Johnson’s denials in absolute tatters!” he cried.But the impact was nothing like the furore in 2017 when Labour’s manifesto was leaked – or when Theresa May insisted “nothing has changed”, after executing a swift U-turn on her social care policy. “It worked for a day, and we had a 36-hour row about whether Donald Trump was going to buy the NHS, but that was it,” said one insider.And as the strategy group tried to hone Labour’s message, focusing on a bread-and-butter offer to leavers, some began to fear Corbyn’s straight-from-the-heart, unscripted authenticity was not the best medium for delivering it. “It’s just Jeremy, isn’t it?” said one exasperated member of the campaign team. “You judge him on a different marking scheme, almost. Did this person in this stump speech hit the five key messages to get on the evening news? No. Was he ever going to? No. I went to rallies where there was a billboard and he didn’t say what was on the fucking billboard. He just talked about whatever he wanted.”As polling day loomed, some aides would have liked Corbyn to make more aggressive attacks on Johnson, whose loose relationship with the truth was openly laughed at by the Question Time audience when the pair met in a head-to-head debate. But “no personal attacks” was one of the rules written for Corbyn’s 2015 leadership campaign by Fisher, and he stuck to it doggedly.The Labour leader told the  at the outset of the campaign, “they go low, we go high” – though one despairing party aide described it as “they go low, we go wandering across the country”.After six gruelling weeks of criss-crossing the country, including a dawn rally in Glasgow on the final day of campaigning, Corbyn watched the grim exit poll with his wife, Laura, his fiercely loyal sons – who released a statement shortly afterwards lambasting the media for treating him badly – and a few officials, including Milne.They had been on a long journey together, from the political wilderness to the brink of government, but they believed their electoral chances had been crushed, in what one rueful Labour source called, “the Brexit vice”.“This campaign was lost before it began,” the source added. “Even if nothing had gone wrong in terms of targeting, messaging, Jeremy’s schedule, TV interviews, anything – I still think we would not have won.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95356b3865f87d2d84885dcd54996a41ebb70704/0_190_5107_3064/master/5107.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e35b38fcda9367713fdab5c12706ae96","title":"dominic cummings thinktank called for end of bbc in current form","story":"New Frontiers Foundation said in 2004 the BBC was ‘mortal enemy’ of Tory partyDominic Cummings’s thinktank called for the “end of the BBC in its current form” and suggested rightwingers should work to undermine the credibility of the broadcaster, branding it the “mortal enemy” of the Conservative party.Cummings, who is Boris Johnson’s most powerful adviser, was the director of the New Frontiers Foundation when it called in 2004 for a campaign to target the BBC and the creation of a Fox News equivalent that would not be constrained by impartiality rules.Opposition MPs said on Tuesday that the views of Cummings’s thinktank would fuel suspicions that Johnson’s administration is gearing up to overhaul the BBC.The disclosure comes at a sensitive time for the corporation, whose director general. Tony Hall, announced on Monday he was standing down. Several Tories have since called for an end to the licence fee, while Labour figures have warned that the BBC is facing a dangerous moment as it approaches its 100th anniversary.The thinktank also suggested an end to the ban on TV political advertising to allow politicians to speak directly to the public in ad breaks during Coronation Street, for example, and the “development of the web networks scrutinising the BBC and providing information to commercial rivals with an interest in undermining the BBC’s credibility”.One post from September 2004 said: “There are three structural things that the right needs to happen in terms of communications... 1) the undermining of the BBC’s credibility 2) the creation of a Fox News equivalent  talk radio shows  bloggers etc to shift the centre of gravity 3) the end of the ban on TV political advertising.”Another idea proposed was that government ministers should avoid appearing on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme – a policy that has come to pass since Cummings entered Downing Street as Boris Johnson’s de facto chief of staff last year.The suggestions were made in a series of long blogposts in 2004 and 2005 by the New Frontiers Foundation, which was a short-lived free market thinktank that aimed to emulate rightwing US organisations such as the Heritage Foundation. Cummings was the director of the thinktank and described as one of two “principal staff”. It folded due to lack of support.No 10 declined to comment but a Whitehall source said it was “not particularly uncommon for special advisers to have expressed opinions before entering No 10”.There are signs that Johnson’s government is already looking at changing the BBC’s funding model, including the possibility of decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee as a first step.The prime minister first called the licence fee into question during the election campaign and Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, has suggested a move to a Netflix-style subscription system could be considered for the BBC, potentially ending almost a century of public broadcasting funded by a licence fee.Ben Bradshaw, the Labour MP and former culture secretary, said Cummings and some Tory MPs “would like nothing more than to replace the BBC with a rightwing propaganda channel like Fox”.He added: “The BBC belongs to the British public, not the government, and the public value the public service ethos of the BBC, objective and accurate information and news and the broad range of much-loved radio and TV programmes and would not take kindly to them being sacrificed to Rupert Murdoch.”Ed Davey, the acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: “The BBC is a national treasure and if Dominic Cummings thinks he has got a mandate to go after Strictly and David Attenborough he has got another thing coming.“Every politician and party will have their problems and frustrations with the BBC, but often that’s because the Beeb are doing their job. The Liberal Democrats will fight for the BBC tooth and nail.”Cummings has criticised the BBC in personal blog posts since 2013, accusing it of showing pro-remain bias, but his thinktank’s proposals from a decade earlier went much further, calling for a campaign to target the corporation and transform the broadcasting landscape to make it more favourable for rightwingers.In a post offering advice to the Tories, the thinktank said the party should copy the US Republicans by realising they were in a “culture war” in which they needed to “shape the culture actively in their favour over long periods with large efforts”.In November 2004 Cummings wrote an article for the Business, a now defunct newspaper, calling for a “campaign to end the licence fee and break the BBC’s stranglehold” and for people to “hire lawyers and investigate whether the ban on television political advertising can be overturned in the courts”.The same argument was made multiple times by the New Frontiers Foundation throughout 2004. The thinktank suggested the Conservatives “can only prosper in the long-term by undermining the BBC’s reputation for impartiality in the way CBS’s reputation is being undermined now, and by changing the law on political advertising.”It added: “The BBC is a determined propagandist with a coherent ideology. We are paying for it. We should not be. We should be changing the game.”Another post from July 2004 said the right “should be aiming for the end of the BBC in its current form and the legalisation of TV political advertising”. Another argued that the “privileged closed world of the BBC needs to be turned upside down and its very existence should be the subject of a very intense and well-funded campaign that involves bringing out whistleblowers armed with internal memos and taped conversations of meetings”.The New Frontiers posts advocated a number of ideas that Cummings has since promoted while in government office. These include the creation of a US-style research body to fund high-risk scientific projects, and reform of Whitehall.One of the thinktank’s blogposts said: “A serious Conservative government would thoroughly purge the civil service and remove swathes of the top people. Rather than pretend that they are neutral, it would be healthier for Britain to adopt the American system and have routine purges as different political parties gain democratic power.”The thinktank also made the argument that appearing on the Today programme was not helpful to ministers. “It is a mistake in general for a Conservative leader to appear on the Today programme unless he is announcing a major new positive proposal, especially if it is to answer a series of attacking questions about ‘strategy’. Today exists to try to make him look stupid and create an echo of ‘U-turn’  ‘gaffe’  ‘confusion’ stories, as with other major politicians. Effort should be erted from Today to programmes that affect the public far more,” it said.Johnson’s ministers have been banned from appearing on Today since after the election in December.Other ideas floated by the thinktank included research into “hypersonic bombers”, reducing trade tariffs “to zero, thus bringing cheaper goods for us and profits rather than disaster for the developing world”, reform of the United Nations and a closer alliance with the US.This was to involve creating with America a “different kind of networked global alliance based on free trade (not a customs union and single market harmonisation), mutual defence, and systems administrator units capable of peacekeeping and disaster relief”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7004c801df1690d6750a01f407cb4dc2484835f3/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8b9f879810dbbebec14136f7d6fa47b","title":"government loses child refugee vote in string of lords defeats","story":"Peers vote to restore right of unaccompanied child refugees to be reunited with families The government has suffered five defeats on its Brexit deal in the space of 24 hours in the House of Lords, with the heaviest defeat in a vote to restore the right of unaccompanied child refugees to be reunited with their families in the UK after Brexit.There was a vote of 300 in favour and 220 against, giving a majority of 80 in support of an amendment, proposed by the Labour peer Alf Dubs, requiring the UK government to maintain the principle of family reunion for child refugees fleeing conflict.“Either the government is mean and nasty or they are giving the impression of being mean and nasty they could quite easily change that impression by accepting this amendment,” Lord Dubs said. “We have shown very clearly that the Lords vote is based on humanitarian principles. It’s now the turn of the Commons to show what they’re made of.”The majority of children flee persecution and endure dangerous journeys across continents alone, often falling into the hands of traffickers or smugglers en route. In 2018, 3,063 unaccompanied child asylum seekers arrived in the UK, the third highest number in Europe.These are children who come here having applied for asylum elsewhere in the EEA, to join family or relatives. In 2018, 159 unaccompanied children arrived in the UK via this route. The Home Office has confirmed The UK will continue to be bound by the Dublin provisions during the Brexit implementation period.Enforced by section 67 of the Immigration Act 2016, these are unaccompanied children brought to the UK having applied for asylum elsewhere in Europe. The number agreed between the government and local authorities was 480. Other than the 220 brought when the Calais camp was cleared in Autumn 2016, the government has stated that they will not provide incremental figures but will announce when the 480 quota has been filled.This scheme was also announced during the passage of the 2016 act. These are not all unaccompanied children some will arrive with family members. The number of iniduals resettled via this route in 2018 was 688, but this also includes adults, as many children on this scheme are resettled with their families. The scheme was not designed to be a route primarily for unaccompanied children, but some children have been resettled without any family members and were placed in local authority care.In 2018, 1,072 children were granted refugee status with a further 73 granted humanitarian protection.The Home Office minister Lady Williams had urged peers not to force a vote on the issue, stating that the government was not dropping its commitments to family reunion for child refugees. She said more than 41,000 children had been granted protection in the UK since 2010 and over 5,000 unaccompanied children were being cared for in England alone.She and two other Home Office ministers had last week summoned Dubs to ask him to stop pushing for this amendment to the EU withdrawal agreement bill, but he declined. He had successfully led a campaign for family reunion rights to continue after Brexit in an earlier version of the withdrawal bill, but the protections were removed in the latest version, published after the December election.The ministers told Dubs that despite the decision to drop the measures from the bill, they would be included in the long-delayed immigration bill later this year.During the debate, Dubs, who came to the UK as a Kindertransport child refugee after fleeing Prague in 1939, said he failed to understand why the government had removed the protection from the bill.He asked the government not to “close the door” on the children affected, noting that some lived in shocking conditions in French camps, and were at risk of sexual exploitation.By providing them with a safe, legal route to the UK, peers would be “thwarting the traffickers” and avoiding the need for youngsters to take more dangerous options to get to their families, he said.The issue will be debated again in the House of Commons on Wednesday, where the government may use its large majority to overturn all the Lords defeats.Beth Gardiner-Smith, the chief executive of Safe Passage, an organisation working with unaccompanied child refugees in Europe, said: “It’s simply not good enough for the government to claim they still back family reunion, whilst taking away the legal protections that support it. All this does is create fear and panic amongst some of the most vulnerable children. The prime minister should now show compassion and agree to the Lords amendment.“Many of the children we support have lost their parents but they have grandparents, siblings, aunts and uncles living in the UK and ready to care for them. It is illogical that these children be denied safe passage to the UK, left with no other choice but to consider smuggling just to reach their loved ones, or to grow up alone without the care of their family – many surviving in camps and car parks across Europe.”The government was defeated in the Lords three times on Monday evening, on an amendment requiring EU citizens living in the UK to be given physical proof of their legal status, an amendment removing the power of ministers to decide which courts should have the power to depart from European court of justice judgments, and an amendment allowing cases to be referred to the supreme court to decide whether to depart from EU case law.On Tuesday afternoon, the government was again defeated on the Dubs amendment, a fifth time, as peers backed calls to reassure Scotland and Wales on devolution powers.The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “We are disappointed the Lords have chosen to amend the withdrawal agreement bill, which the Commons passed unamended with a majority of 99. Protecting vulnerable children will remain our priority after Brexit, and the withdrawal agreement bill reaffirms our commitment, while clarifying the role of parliament and government in negotiations. We will seek to overturn this amendment as the bill returns to the Commons.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d675423d5d1f73c0bac3bb0e13517dc623afae2/516_307_1464_878/master/1464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe70798d9a7fa4bd62c676d9c1c98f56","title":"happy fleet could electric vehicles enhance the joy of driving","story":"EVs mean cleaner cities, but could they improve the experience for drivers too? One ground-breaking partnership piloted by Audi and Addison Lee Group uncovered some surprising benefits to going electricFor companies that rely on fleet vehicles, change is inevitable. A raft of green policies have introduced zero-emissions targets, along with financial incentives encouraging businesses to adopt cleaner cars and vans, such as no vehicle tax for electric company cars in 202021.However, as well as helping the planet and improving a company’s bottom line, the “greening” of vehicle fleets by going fully electric could bring additional benefits. A recent widely reported study found that jumping behind the wheel of an electric car – rather than a traditional petrol or diesel – could also make drivers happier, calmer and less stressed too.Those findings are backed up by Audi’s own research, which found that electric vehicle drivers typically get more pleasure from the experience. According to a combination of 1,350 surveys and 2,000 minutes of interviews, the benefits include a reduction in vibration and engine noise, which can leave drivers feeling less drained after spending time in traffic. EV drivers also reported being able to perform difficult manoeuvres much more easily, and a greater sense of control. Others felt more at one with the vehicle as a result of all the technology. As one respondent put it: “It’s part of me when I drive. It has so much tech involved in it.”That Audi research is now being put to the test as part of a forward-thinking pilot partnership with the Addison Lee Group’s business class car service, Tristar.Addison Lee Group has added five new luxury e-tron SUVs, Audi’s first fully electric cars, with a range of up to 237 miles, to its premium London lineup. The aim is to offer chauffeurs, customers, and both businesses a unique opportunity to understand the real-world performance, opportunities and challenges of going fully electric to achieve a zero-emissions future.The Addison Lee Group chauffeurs underwent simple training with Audi’s electric vehicle specialists before going out to work as usual, driving premium customers around the capital.The ongoing trial enables Addison Lee Group and Audi to see how the cars perform in a real-world, business-critical situation – where running out of battery is not an option. That includes collecting hard data on mileage and usage from the car’s telemetrics, along with the driver’s subjective feedback on the challenges of adopting electric in real-world conditions, including things such as the availability of charging.The proof, though, is in the driving. So what did Addison Lee Group’s trialists make of the experience behind the wheel?“From the beginning I said that I was going to drive it the same way I would a diesel car and that’s what I’ve done,” says Alan Meere, a platinum chauffeur for Tristar. “I feel more relaxed when I get home because I haven’t spent the day fighting the steering wheel. There’s also no droning constantly in your ear like you can get with diesel cars, and you notice that especially after a motorway run. You still get the noise of the tyres but even that’s quieter.”According to Meere, who lives in Sittingbourne, Kent and has been driving for the Addison Lee Group for nine years, any potential anxiety about range soon subsided.“When I came into the pilot, my main reservations were things like whether there would be enough chargers,” he says. “Also, would living so far from London make a difference? But once you realise how good the car is, and you start to understand how to fit charging into your daily routine, that all goes away. Many service stations now have these chargers.”“Being able to plug it in and leave it overnight is hugely convenient,” says Meere. “But if I’m not home long enough for work reasons, then there are also options close by where I can charge it quickly, ready for the next day.”According to figures from Zap Map, a listing app that helps you find your nearest charge points, there are more than 10,000 charging locations in the UK. Finding nearby charge isn’t dissimilar to seeking out your closest petrol station – you learn the locations of the points you use most often.“I’ve developed a map in my head of where I can charge,” says Meere. “If I need a speedy charge, there are three places I use regularly – one at Heathrow and two near where I live. On the 150Kw points I can get close to full in 40 minutes,” he adds.This partnership has been so successful that it’s been extended beyond the initial six months. “I believe our collaboration with Addison Lee Group has been invaluable as a means of further demystifying the concept of the fully electric Audi,” says Andrew Doyle, director of Audi UK.“Although the e-tron is revolutionary as far as our brand is concerned, this project has helped to emphasise its uncomplicated, user-friendly normality to everyone who travels in one. On the one hand, it has proved that it requires minimal compromise as a daily-use proposition by meeting the understandably rigorous demands of Addison Lee Group’s professional drivers in an undeniably challenging working environment. On the other, it has driven home the fact that in terms of comfort, configuration and general usability, the car is a home-from-home for anyone familiar with a contemporary Audi.”Paul McCabe, corporate director at Addison Lee Group, says the pilot has helped to inform the group’s decisions about the fleet choices it will make as it works towards its target of having a fleet capable of zero emissions by 2022. “By generating data-driven insights, the e-tron pilot has allowed us to evaluate the real-world performance and requirements of electric vehicles in our fleet of the future,” he says.Although big change is coming, much will stay the same, and that’s a comfort for those who will experience the revolution first hand.“It’s still a car and you still just drive it the same way,” says Meere, “but it’s just more pleasant to drive. If I had the choice, I’d stay with the electric vehicle now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b554c589762cbd4d108fea72ed3bcf8cedbe873c/646_413_1251_751/master/1251.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a32d4d67e74e507fc122efad1cc75337","title":"five ways to resist the seductive allure of pointless technology","story":"When faced with shiny new tech, many companies and startups feel the urge to jump on the bandwagon, but innovating for the sake of it is rarely a good idea. Here’s how to avoid the pitfalls …Whisper it quietly, but often it’s much simpler to push an old-fashioned light switch than to shout three or four times at a hard-of-hearing voice-activated smart assistant. And, let’s face it, do workplace managers really want to install motion scanners under the desks of their employees to see who takes the longest toilet breaks?Sure, it’s obviously important for businesses to stay on top of tech advances, but there’s a thin line between innovating with purpose and innovating just for the sake of it.Ryan Abbott, professor of law and health sciences at the University of Surrey, specialises in the impact of AI, machine learning and technological advances, but even he believes that common sense sometimes makes more sense than deep learning: “It’s not clear there’s value to technology for technology’s sake and people may adopt it for the wrong reasons – maybe because there’s hype associated with it, rather than considering whether it’s really efficient to use things like artificial intelligence for different tasks.”He’s also less than convinced about all of his smart watch features: “I’m not sure I need my watch to tell me to breathe every five seconds either. I’m not sure it does much more than raise my blood pressure.”Bear in mind that there’s a litany of wonder-technology fads that led nowhere. Do you see many people wearing their computer screen in their glasses? Or using their telephones to monitor whether their toothbrush is scrubbing those hard-to-reach parts?A few years ago, the travel industry got very excited when Icelandair became the first ever airline to allow people to book flights through Facebook Messenger via a booking bot. It has quietly been retired.It’s also tempting to get caught up in the hype around the “smart city”, with its lamp-posts that listen for sounds of trouble. Even Laurence Kemball-Cook, founder and chief executive of Pavegen – which installs paving slabs that turn kinetic energy from people’s footsteps into electricity – thinks that a lot of city development is frivolous, not functional. “Everybody is talking about smart cities, but they are talking about smart for smart’s sake – Bluetooth umbrellas that tell you when it’s raining, multiple connected devices, smart watch, smartphone, smart shoes,” he says. “I’m fed up with that. Our mantra is technology that works for people.”In a world in which shiny innovations have become seductive siren calls, how can businesses resist the allure of pointless tech fads?TeamworkAbbott recommends involving the whole business in creating a new product from the start. “Make sure products are being developed by multidisciplinary teams – not just tech people who may be interested in doing something for the sake of technology but without an ultimate view of what would benefit the consumer,” he says.Explore low-tech alternativesAnother good tip is to consider whether a low-tech solution might exist to your problem before investing in the latest one. You could equip your reception with all kinds of gadgets, scanners, buzzers and heart-rate checks – or perhaps you could make a beautiful garden so everyone walks into work feeling a little more relaxed.Due diligenceOther experts suggest looking at the people behind the company of the tech you are considering: do they live their own principles or are they living the high life? “Do the founders have a purpose other than making money?” Kemball-Cook always asks. “Look at their values: I try to live as sustainably as possible. If your primary goal is making impact, all the good things will follow.”The sustainability testKeep an eye on the environmental impact of what you are doing. Prof Nikki Dibben, a University of Sheffield academic who worked on Bjork’s high-tech project Biophilia, an album that works with all kinds of tech and applications to teach elements of music and science to children, adds: “The value of technology has to be seen within a sustainability agenda. If we’re simply doing things for the sake of doing things, we are going to end up ultimately wasting resources.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4b8ddbea84a0fc7866ca0216c19ee80b2cc6622/0_138_2120_1273/master/2120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e49cbc28cf6cc78ea7bae89cc9dcb358","title":"social workers tell us how you feel about your job","story":"Take part in our survey to have your say about the profession and the wider sectorWhat’s it like to be a social worker in the UK right now?We have launched the latest edition of the  Jobs Social Lives survey into the issues affecting staff at all stages of their careers – from the frontline to management.The research, carried out by Ipsos Mori on behalf of the  and new regulator Social Work England, is an opportunity to have your say about issues including workloads, pay and how the profession is viewed.Our last Social Lives study, published in 2017, found more than four-fifths of participants were proud of what they do, and more than three-quarters said they enjoyed their jobs, but most thought their caseloads were too high.Help us to find out whether the picture has changed.

But each of these achievements was eclipsed by another, his world-record spell of 21.5 consecutive maiden overs – 131 balls without conceding so much as a single run. It was Nadkarni’s 99.94, his 501, his 19 for 90. Sachin Tendulkar said last week that he grew up hearing about the feat.It was in Chennai in 1964, the first Test against England. It was, Nadkarni said, a peculiar match, a fight in which neither side wanted to throw a punch. India batted first and declared on 457 for seven. By the start of the third morning, England were 63 for two and, worse, four of the team were suffering from food poisoning. Micky Stewart and Jim Parks had it so bad they were laid up in bed with fever. They kept a car waiting outside in case they needed to be rushed to the ground to bat. England had to stall for time till they were better, so their two doughty batsmen, Brian Bolus and Ken Barrington, decided to start blocking. And blocking. And blocking.And Nadkarni just kept bowling. And bowling. And bowling.Nadkarni had learned his cricket in Bombay, a hard school. “Bombay cricket at that time was so disciplined,” he said later. “The basic principle was to be accurate to the point of perfection.” He’d drop a coin on a length outside off-stump, sketch a chalk circle around it, and spend hours bowling at the spot. “His favourite term from where we all learned from was ‘chhodo mat’,” Gavaskar said last week. It means hang in there. “Chhodo mat. You are playing for India. That thing we learned from him.”The Chennai Test became a blinking contest. After lunch there were 12 maiden overs in a row. “Neither batsman attempted to score any but the most obvious runs,” wrote Henry Blofeld in the . “A number of half volleys were pushed back defensively.” Nadkarni gave up a single soon after he’d come on, and after that, it was maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, as monotonous as the tick tock of the classroom clock.Finally, just after three in the afternoon, Nadkarni was five balls through what would have been his 22nd maiden when the man at mid-on misfielded and the batsmen stole a single. And, just like that, Nadkarni’s captain took him out of the attack, “as if”, the Times noted, he was all of a sudden judged “altogether too expensive” to carry on. Nadkarni was still annoyed about it 50 years later. He had bowled 131 consecutive dot balls. It is one of those records that will likely stand as long as they’re playing the game. South Africa’s Hugh Tayfield once bowled 137 in a row but they were spread across two innings.The Chennai Test was a draw. So were nine of the 10 other games they played on that tour, including all the other four Tests. It was one of the most stultifying boring series ever played and yet it pulled in a total of over a million spectators. “Day after day,” Wisden reported, “the Test grounds, who capacity varied between 30,000 and 45,000, were packed. Financially the tour was a rousing success, though the nature of the play inflicted sore wounds on the game of cricket.” Back in England, they were already trying county one-day cricket as a tonic, soon enough they’d start playing it internationally too. Fifty years later, they’re still coming up with new cures.Because there is no getting around it, Nadkarni’s duel with Barrington and Bolus must have been one of the most singularly dull passages of sport anyone was ever asked to pay for the privilege of watching, a psychological Sahara of a day out at the cricket. A strange entertainment, this, and not one they’re interested in showing on free-to-air TV in the 21st century. But Nadkarni is still remembered for it, celebrated for it, all these years later, because as everyone who loves Test cricket knows, the boredom’s part of the pleasure, what would the good bits be worth without all those lovely lulls when the game drifts like dust in a sunbeam? There are days of play we euphemistically describe “for the purists”, some vanishing band of diehards, a dwindling audience of Bapu Nadkarni fans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ea0d6b3fb9b658fc7d95db82c81937e918d495e/0_80_4085_2452/master/4085.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e0ed18df801f725e1ca79c0d7d53260","title":"premiership rugby saracens come clean salary cap report","story":"• ‘Why wouldn’t they want it published? It’s a question for them’ • CEO Darren Childs insists no other clubs are breaking salary capPremiership Rugby has rejected any suggestion that other leading clubs may be breaching the salary cap following Saracens’ relegation to the Championship. The chief executive, Darren Childs, has acknowledged, however, that the champions’ repeated financial misconduct has tarnished the league and unfairly impacted on their rivals.In his first interview since the news of Saracens’ demotion was confirmed last weekend, Childs described the club’s serial cheating of the regulations as “a dark cloud” hanging over the Premiership.He said he would prefer to see Lord Dyson’s initial report into the Saracens affair made public and is adamant the rest of the Premiership is complying with the cap.“I’ve asked our salary-cap manager that question a dozen times now and there is no current investigation or anything else he is looking at,” said Childs, who joined Premiership Rugby last year from UKTV. “All the other clubs are compliant and feel really let down by all this.“I get the fact they feel let down. The salary cap is the right thing to have and they have all signed up to it. I’ve sat in a box and watched a club lose to a side where there’s a question mark as to whether they are compliant or not.“The emotion is palpable. Everyone wants a level playing field. It’s not about rigging the system in your favour and winning at any cost.”To help restore trust, Childs indicated he would like to see the report into Saracens’ cap-busting behaviour released in full, rather than withheld at the request of Saracens’ lawyers, and would like the club to reconsider its stance.“Premiership Rugby has got absolutely nothing to hide in that judgment. In fact, quite the opposite. It demonstrates we’ve got a good, well-enforced, fair salary-cap system. I must admit I am very minded to take that decision on again and look at whether we should be publishing these things. I would welcome the opportunity to set the record straight.“It is very important to stress that we have specifically not been given that permission. We cannot publish Lord Dyson’s full decision regardless of what anyone would like us to do. Saracens are not supportive of that document being published.“It was very much their lawyers’ decision that it should remain confidential. Why wouldn’t they want it published? That’s a question for them. But if they’re prepared to change their mind I would be prepared to discuss it with my board with a view to publishing it.”Childs also remains frustrated by the widespread belief that Premiership Rugby should have clamped down more swiftly on Saracens’ wrongdoing, defended as mere “naivety” by their former chairman Nigel Wray.“It’s been complex and important to get right,” Childs said. “After a number of conversations with Saracens over the last four to six weeks it became inevitable relegation was the right measure to take.“It couldn’t wait until the end of the season. We needed to crack on. A lot of people are pointing the finger at us, which is a bit tough to take, but we’re trying to keep people on a level playing field. I don’t think the existing regulations are at fault. The regs have not cheated.”Those running the league are also sensitive to the reputational damage to the sport and Childs has confirmed that, had they not accepted relegation, Saracens would have been required to open their books to show exactly how they remunerated a squad who have won three of the past four European titles and five domestic titles in the past decade.“It would have been inevitable that we would have started a forensic audit imminently had we not reached this agreement,” Childs said.“I want a dynamic, competitive tournament that people up and down the country can enjoy knowing their side has got a chance of winning. I’m not going to turn a blind eye to this stuff. I will enforce the rules and regulations to the absolute letter of the law. I’m trying to make sure this never happens again.“It has been a massive distraction for us but I hope one day we get some acknowledgement that we dealt with it in a robust way.“It would also be nice to talk about what is happening on the pitch rather than in the boardroom.”Any changes to the salary-cap regulations, such as making players’ salaries public, are to be considered in a detailed review by Lord Myners, with an initial consultation period to commence this week.“I realised there were a number of things that should be looked at and I also want a more open approach in the future,” said Childs, insisting the new commercial shareholders CVC were fully supportive of Saracens’ demotion.In the meantime he hopes the spectacle will not be diminished by the fact the relegation picture has already been settled.“We’ve got assurances from Saracens that they will maintain the integrity of the tournament until the end of the season before they go down into the Championship.“I think they are going to want to go out and put their best foot forward – there are some fascinating games still to come. The fan is crucial to this industry and that’s the bit that makes me sad. That is not something we take lightly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fc9d3e45350d14902ecd901a655b281308fc269/0_311_4506_2704/master/4506.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=429b26619ce15124051a13a0a891f033","title":"naomi osaka and cori gauff remain on collision course at australian open","story":"Naomi Osaka and Coco Gauff, two of the most precocious talents tennis has had in many years, are on track to meet in the third round of the Australian Open on Friday. The defending champion will start favourite, having beaten the American teenager handily at Flushing Meadows six months ago, but will take nothing for granted.They won in contrasting styles on Wednesday, Osaka having the easier time of it over two sets against the unseeded Saisai Zheng in an hour and 20 minutes on Margaret Court Arena, while Gauff, the youngest player in either draw at 15, had to dig deep to beat the seasoned Romanian Sorana Cirstea, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5, in a thriller that lasted just over two hours on the Melbourne Arena.“It’s amazing what different personalities can bring to the sport,” Osaka said of Gauff. “Since she is so young, she has brought so much interest and a new wave. She played doubles in one of the stadiums at the US Open last year and it was full. That is not normal and I don’t think it is something that can be taken for granted.”Gauff, still riding high after putting Venus Williams out of a slam in the first round for the second time, said courtside of Osaka: “I know what to expect in the next round. She’s a great competitor. I know it’s going to be a good one.”She paid tribute to the crowd for lifting her when she was love-three down in the deciding set. “It’s amazing. I didn’t think I’d get so much support in Australia. They cheered me on to win. I don’t know why, but I’m glad I have their support. I have that will to win.”Osaka, who entertains as much in her post-match deliberations as on the court, said after her 6-2, 6-4 win: “I got very frustrated in the second set, and it’s something that I knew would happen, but I didn’t know the scale, like, what she would do to make me frustrated. She was slicing and dicing and getting everything. I was, like: ‘Can I just hit a winner already?’”Osaka has switched coaches again, from Jermain Jenkins to Fissette, who helped Johanna Konta to the Wimbledon semi-finals in 2017 and recently left Victoria Azarenka – which is part of the merry-go-round for hired help on the women’s tour. Sascha Bajin, who hit with Serena Williams for many years, coached Osaka to her first slam in New York two Septembers ago.Bajin has since joined the exciting teenager, Dayana Yastremska, who made the final in Adelaide against Ashleigh Barty on Saturday, but lost to Caroline Wozniacki. The 29-year-old Dane, who retires after this tournament, came from two breaks down in the second set to win, 7-5, 7-5, and is one win away from a fourth-round match against her best friend, Serena Williams – if the American beats the Slovakian world No 70 Tamara Zidansek.Heather Watson won her postponed first-round match, conquering the swirling wind on an outside court, and the steady tennis of Krystina Pliskova. She struggled at the start, losing her serve twice but made it tough for Pliskova in a stubborn passage of play at the end of the set, forcing her to save two break points before getting over the line. Watson took that energy into the second set and dominated most of the exchanges, breaking to level at a set apiece.Pliskova was now fading under the consistent pressure from the back of the court, as Watson rallied her into submission in the third. The mistakes piled up for the languid Czech, who continued to go for her shots but found the net an inconvenience. A final wayward shot from the baseline ended her agony.Watson out-served her, made fewer mistakes and hit more clean winners, including nine aces in just under two hours to win, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1. It was an impressive, solid performance to go with her run to the semi-finals in Hobart last week and, given she looked stronger as the match went on, should be in good shape, mentally and physically, for Elise Mertens in the second round.“It was super windy today,” Watson said. “I felt prepared because it was like that in Hobart a lot of the days. Being the first-round match and it being postponed, I was a bit nervous in the first set, a bit tense. After the first set, I managed to loosen up, relax and start enjoying it. I thought my game improved more and more as the match went on.”She said growing up in windy Guernsey has helped her in such conditions. “I don’t mind the wind at all. The way I play – slice, drop-shots, change of pace – I think it works well in the wind. And I’m patient.”She next plays the Belgian world No 17 Mertens, who finished strongly to beat Danka Kovinic, 6-2, 6-0, in under an hour. “I played her last week, played her a few times in the past,” Watson said. “She’s a great player, very solid. It will be a tough match. It will give me confidence to know that I can beat her, especially if it gets close in those tight moments"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81dffc117879df867ac5d9a99e8281fb61c4a755/980_537_2052_1231/master/2052.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9745b1813605fd719b962f73d6a1a1b8","title":"amar ramasar west side story broadway comeback metoo","story":"A dancer accused of sharing explicit images of another dancer is starring in this season’s splashy new take on West Side Story, leading to upset in the theater communityIn the Broadway revival of West Side Story, Amar Ramasar pulls the actor who plays Anita in for a kiss and tosses her around the dance floor. He embodies his character Bernardo – sexy, intense – and his onstage girlfriend drapes over him like an accessory.At one point in the show, they burrow into each other as big and little spoons. Seconds later, she mounts him near center stage.Ramasar, 38, is starring in the Broadway revival less than two years after he was outed as a player in one of ballet’s most infamous #MeToo moments.Not everyone’s a fan of his onstage comeback.“I’m sure there’s someone equally as talented who is deserving of this opportunity who isn’t entangled in a sex scandal, you know?” said Christina Bargelt, a professional ballerina and sexual assault awareness advocate and activist. “Put in the understudy. I’m sure he’s fabulous.”“Text me those photosvideos!!” Ramasar wrote to his former New York City Ballet colleague Chase Finlay. The latter obliged, sending images of his then girlfriend, Alexandra Waterbury, performing a sexual act, bare-breasted, according to a complaint filed in the state supreme court in Manhattan.Waterbury, now 22, is a student at Columbia University who trained at City Ballet’s affiliated dance school. She has sworn an affidavit that she never gave Finlay permission to photograph her in the nude or capture her on camera while they were having sex, much less disseminate explicit images of her.“I was assaulted. Several other women were assaulted. And like, there’s proof of it,” Waterbury told the .Ramasar, in turn, shared intimate pictures of a female City Ballet corps member with Finlay, among them an image of the woman’s vagina, the complaint says. Their back-and-forth is part of a larger trove of correspondence that Waterbury unearthed on Finlay’s computer between City Ballet dancers and donors, in which men compared women to “farm animals” and “sluts” and expressed the desire to “violate” and “abuse” them.In one string of texts, Finlay suggested sharing Waterbury with Ramasar. According to photos of the messages provided to the , Ramasar wrote: “I might need blow in order to try and f*** her!” The West Side Story actor later insinuated that he planned to offer his own partner in exchange because he would owe Finlay.Beyond the texts, Waterbury has alleged that Ramasar would grope and kiss people at after-parties and gatherings. She had to ask Finlay to tell Ramasar to leave her alone because she didn’t want to be touched.On 15 September 2018, Ramasar wrote on Instagram: “Unfortunately we live in a time where allegations are taken as fact, and actions are made rashly and harshly.”A few days later, he captioned another photo: “The messages exchanged between Mr. Finlay and myself were private and sent on personal time outside of work.” He claimed that pictures he possessed of a female City Ballet dancer were of a “consenting adult” and “the photos that were sent to me I have not circulated”.Ramasar’s exile from the spotlight lasted mere months. By January 2019, he wrote on social media about his “new home”, Teatro Dell’Opera Di Roma in Italy. That February, he returned to New York to perform with the dancer Michele Wiles’ company BalletNext. And in April, he was ordered reinstated at City Ballet by an arbitrator who reportedly required him to undergo counseling but believed his termination the previous year had gone too far (the arbitrator’s decision was not made public).“As I move forward, learning, and evolving, I am eager to once again dance amongst the colleagues I respect, doing the ballets I have held close to my heart for the past 18 years,” Ramasar said at the time.By May, he was performing again as a principal dancer with City Ballet. Then, in July, a new adaptation of West Side Story produced by Scott Rudin and directed by the Tony Award winner Ivo van Hove announced Ramasar as Bernardo.In 10 months, he had gone full circle and ended up exactly where he left off: a favorite at City Ballet with a starring role on Broadway.Previews for West Side Story started in December, and the show will officially open on 20 February.“The longer he’s there, the longer he’s getting paid. The longer he’s getting a good reputation. The longer he’s kind of just, like, making all of this disappear,” Waterbury said.Rick Miramontez, a spokesman for the production, defended Ramasar’s hiring by pointing to the arbitrator’s call to reinstate him at City Ballet.“Throughout that legal process, Amar received the full support of Actors Equity Association, and he is currently a member in good standing of the union,” Miramontez wrote in a statement. “We are aligned with Actors Equity in its support of Amar’s employment eligibility and his appearance in our production of West Side Story.”But a different union appealed Ramasar’s termination from City Ballet, and a spokesperson for Actors’ Equity said it took no position on the arbitration.In terms of Ramasar’s casting in West Side Story, Brandon Lorenz, communications director for Actors’ Equity, said the union “did not make any hiring suggestions regarding any member of the West Side Story company” and “had no awareness of casting decisions for West Side Story before the cast was publicly announced”.“Equity did not communicate ‘support’ to the employer about any members of the company as part of the hiring process,” Lorenz wrote in a statement.Miramontez declined for others involved in the production, including Ramasar, to answer questions for this article.Alisa Hurwitz, a clinical psychologist who specializes in sexual trauma and writes about theater and psychology, called the choice to cast Ramasar “absolutely, unequivocally irresponsible”.Hurwitz believes that Ramasar’s fellow dancers are either in active denial about the accusations leveled against him, or they’re being made to feel unsafe because they’re in such a physically intimate situation with him. Artists who know Waterbury and are familiar with her experience reiterated those safety concerns.“If I knew that someone had been found guilty of misconduct, harassment or assault, I’d feel incredibly uncomfortable with that person being in a place where they could be partnering me, or really anything backstage,” said Jessica Altchiler, a sexual assault survivor who is currently part of a Broadway national tour.After the sexual assault awareness advocate Bargelt’s former classmates from the University of Utah performed alongside Ramasar with BalletNext last year, she wrote a letter to the school’s dance community and leadership calling him “an exploitative sexual predator” and questioning the decision-making that put her peers “in harm’s way”.“I just really didn’t appreciate that he was allowed access to my friends, who are the same age as Alex, essentially,” Bargelt said. “That seemed really not cool to me.”West Side Story features a similarly green cast. Ramasar, a 20-year veteran of New York’s most prominent stages, is the exception. The show has touted how dozens of performers are making their Broadway debuts. Some are still in college. Others graduated recently.The revival is being heralded as “one of the most eagerly awaited productions of the 2019-2020 season”.Ahead of the show’s opening night, more than 21,000 signatures on a Change.org petition are calling to “get Amar Ramasar off the stage”. The 19-year-old college student and former dancer Megan Rabin, who created the petition, said she hoped Ramasar would be removed from the cast and his firing would serve as a precedent that people who violate women will be held accountable.Chris Peterson, founder and editor-in-chief of OnStage Blog, has advocated for theatergoers to boo Ramasar during his bows. “If one person boos, not only will Amar Ramasar hear it, but everyone around you will hear it, and it becomes a palpable, effective, impactful protest,” Peterson told the .For her part, Hurwitz, the psychologist, said she would not be attending West Side Story because she did not want her money going to Ramasar and the people who hired him. Bargelt and Waterbury suggested that others follow suit.“Say nobody shows up to West Side Story. They don’t sell any tickets. And it’s all because of Amar. What do you think they’re gonna do? Fire Amar,” Waterbury said. “The ticket buyers have all of the power, whether they know that or not.”But the box office has been doing just fine. West Side Story has already broken a house record at the Broadway Theatre, where it is being performed. It has easily grossed more than $1m each week, even when one of its stars was injured and out of the show.At a Monday night performance in mid-January, a huge audience packed into the orchestra and mezzanine. When Ramasar took his bow, the actor who played Anita bowed alongside him.And no one booed – at least not loudly enough to hear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3193cd9d175e43964058d1dcf1be3eb283fb262/625_316_5670_3402/master/5670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3627c5a8a7662389952415bd2a79303b","title":"kent cobham dairy digital detox landmark trust no wifi","story":"The Landmark Trust has refurbished this historic ‘pleasure dairy’ in the Kent countryside as an ideal wifi-free getaway – some might say it’s maid in heavenLet’s face it, at some point we’ve all had a hankering to get in touch with our inner Marie Antoinette. Not so much the thoughtless “Let them eat brioche” side of the spendthrift French queen (assuming she ever said it) but her playing at being a rustic farmworker but dropping it all and heading back to the palace as soon as it becomes a chore vibe. It’s a dream few of us get to realise, though one woman who did was Elizabeth Brownlow, 4th Countess of Darnley. She lived at a time (late 18thearly 19th century) when a return to the simple life was en vogue among the landed gentry – as a response to the mechanisation unleashed by the Industrial Revolution.Around two centuries later, I found myself staying in the restored “pleasure dairy” she had built on the southern edge of the grounds of Cobham Hall, an Elizabethan country house (now a school) near Rochester, Kent. The work of prolific architect James Wyatt, it was intended to resemble an Italianate chapel. The dairy served as an elegant retreat where Elizabeth could oversee the production of butter, cream and cheese from the estate’s cows, or hold decorous tea parties for her high-born female friends, away from the strictures of a world dominated by men.This month, the Landmark Trust opened it as holiday accommodation. The trust has spent five years returning the dilapidated building into the playful, if undoubtedly fey, confection it had been in 1794-5 when erected. Working from Wyatt’s drawings, craftspeople replaced the unusual slate cladding on the brick walls, made up the sanded paint used to give those slates a look of glimmering stone, and replaced the coloured and ornamented window panes. They also rebuilt the glorious fan-vaulted ceiling and recreated the interior’s intricate plasterwork, its corbels and bosses festooned with oak leaves.I’d arrived by bike from Sole Street station, a two-mile ride that took me past the community shop in Cobham village, which was handy for picking up a few victuals. Leaving the road, I pedalled into Cobham Park, turning down a dark holloway to pass through a gap in high bushes of laurel. And there was the dairy, in the sunshine, for all the world a tiny chapel complete with gothic mullioned windows, a bell tower and views down through ancient trees to Cobham Hall.Inside, I was greeted with a patterned stone floor, an almost double-height ceiling, a collection of large, venerable-looking milk bowls and a couple of comfy armchairs arranged around a woodburning stove (an indulgent extra, given the efficacy of the underfloor heating). The other rooms, long, slim affairs, were wrapped around this parlour – a smart kitchen, a bathroom in whose deep, free-standing bath I took nightly soaks, and a room just wide enough for a double bed. This last had once been the bedroom of Sarah Hemmings, the first of a succession of dairy maids to live here.Unlike Sarah, I was not pressed into work. For much of my stay, when not indulging in writing, I was more than content to lounge about, enjoying the beauty of the interior, the play of window-coloured sunlight on the paintwork, and the serenity of the place. None of the three sounds that penetrated the walls were any the less delightful for being hackneyed: the soughing of the wind in the trees, the chatter of woodland birds and the occasional pitter-patter of rain. And, in common with all other Landmark Trust properties, there was no wifi to disrupt the peace. The comprehensive information pack had advised me there was unlikely to be any signal either. The heads-up proved academic: I had forgotten to bring my phone.Though Cobham is a village it still runs to three pubs, so we ate lunch at the 16th-century Leather Bottle, a favourite haunt of Charles Dickens, who had Mr Pickwick sing its praises. But I was happy to return to the cosy confines of the dairy. As I sat – too idle even to make up a fire – it was pleasing to reflect that by thrusting me back to a pre-digital world of quiet, uninterrupted pleasures, Elizabeth’s flight of fancy had resumed its original role as antidote to the frenzied helter-skelter of the age.• Accommodation was provided by Cobham Dairy (sleeps two, from £468 for four nights).

According to the New York Times, another ICIJ partner, PwC worked with 20 of their companies.Moritz said that from a reputational perspective, the Dos Santos story was the worst thing to have happened to PwC under his chairmanship, but he believed it was an exception and not the norm.The company, which made millions from its work for Dos Santos, previously said it was terminating any work for entities controlled by members of her family “in response to the very serious and concerning allegations”.After graduating from a British university, Dos Santos began her career at Coopers \u0026amp Lybrand, which went on to become PricewaterhouseCoopers, or PwC. She later hired former PwC staff as close advisers.They include the chair of Fidequity, the Lisbon wealth management outfit that helped administer her empire and whose data forms part of the leak. When Dos Santos was appointed to run the Angolan state oil company, Sonangol, she recruited her chief financial officer from PwC.Moritz said he was disappointed that PwC had not picked up warning signals from its work in Angola. “When we look at some of the signs that were there, we should have picked them up earlier, and that was our mistake,” he said.Moritz said the investigation at PwC would go as high as it needed to, but he denied that his own job was at risk. Appointed in 2016, he is the chairman of the PwC International Network, which supports more than 276,000 employees in 157 countries. In this capacity, he leads a network of PwC firms that serve clients around the globe from multinational companies to startups.“I’m not worried about my job, but I’m worried about making sure this organisation does what it needs to do,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbeff53ddefef7977d5d50bcde51b9e9f1a14edd/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b988cb48958f3a5d2e4bf6cf4d58b799","title":"venezuela colombia border region human rights watch","story":"Human Rights Watch report finds rape, murder and kidnappings on both sides of border, where people are unable to move freelyGuerrilla groups have supplanted state rule on both sides of the lawless border between Venezuela and Colombia, where they impose their own brutal rules on civilians, according to a new report by Human Rights Watch (HRW).In Colombia’s eastern Arauca province and the neighbouring Apure state in Venezuela, civilians are unable to move freely, forced to obey a strict curfew and taxed on virtually all economic activity. HRW documented abuses including murder, kidnappings, disappearances, child recruitment and rape.“Armed groups in Arauca and Apure also punish residents with forced labor, requiring them to work for free, sometimes for months, farming, cleaning roads, or cooking in the armed groups’ camps, which are often in Venezuela,” says the report, released on Wednesday.The groups act with impunity thanks to limited state authorities on both sides of the porous border where they impose their own rules. Two of the groups have even handed out a manual for residents of the region.Those that do not follow the groups’ strict rules pay the ultimate price. The bodies of 16 civilians were found in Arauca last year, with scraps of paper on them announcing a “justification” for the killing, the report found. “The texts accused the murdered victims of being ‘informants’, ‘rapists’, ‘drug dealers’, or ‘thieves’, for example.”Security on the Colombian side of the border was supposed to improve following a historic peace deal in 2016 with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), which had fought against the government for five decades.While that accord formally ended a conflict that killed over 260,000 and forced 7 million from their homes, little has changed on the ground in former Farc strongholds such as the Arauca province.HRW’s report claims that one of the two armed groups present there is a splinter group of the Farc’s 10th Front, which still uses the defunct rebel army’s insignia.Another Colombian leftist group, the National Liberation Army (ELN) works in alliance with the dissidents. The Patriotic Forces of National Liberation (FPLN), a Venezuelan guerrilla group that supports its country’s leftist government, is also present.“The Colombian-Venezuelan border is strategically important to armed groups due to the illegal economies that exist there, including contraband, drug trafficking, and human trafficking,” said Juan Pappier, one of the authors of the report. “Armed groups can also attack civilians in Colombia and then use Venezuela as a rearguard, something that happens often on the Arauca-Apure border.”Colombia’s president, Iván Duque, has accused Venezuela’s embattled president Nicolás Maduro of directly contributing to the insecurity by sheltering ELN and dissident Farc fighters.Over 4 million people have now fled Venezuela, the United Nations’ refugee agency reports. Many migrants, deeply impoverished, make the route through Colombia on foot, where they are further at risk of armed groups.“Civilians pay the price for the security mess in Arauca, including the Venezuelan immigrants already fleeing a serious humanitarian crisis in their country,” Pappier said.Jesús Tuta, a Venezuelan migrant labourer, crossed into Colombia at an informal crossing in Arauca. Without a passport or any official documents, he had to pay off armed groups to cross the Arauca river on a small boat. “There may be soldiers at the border, but they don’t do anything. The guerrillas control everything – they are a fact of life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0da62f03250c88a717e0beab4972cc7584b9e333/0_275_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36c54c28278a25eb7cd76746d5feb38a","title":"what does your 10 manicure really cost the unvarnished truth about nail bars","story":"Are vulnerable young Vietnamese people being routinely trafficked into the UK to work in cut-price nail salons? Amelia Gentleman joins a police raid on one shop suspected of involvement in exploitationOnline reviews for this small south-London nail bar are mixed. “Best nail bar in Peckham,” one says. Most comments, however, are more grudging. “Suppose you get what you pay for,” another concludes (customers here do not pay very much, just £10 for a full manicure). Most telling are the comments about the staff. “The younger girls and boys seem to be learning as they go” “Communication is close to none as they don’t speak English.”It is this lack of English that is one of the warning flags that has put the shop on a list of nail bars requiring investigation for possible exploitation. On a slow Thursday afternoon, the shabby venue is being raided by 20 police officers three people are later arrested on human trafficking charges and four frightened young employees are taken temporarily to a council-run reception centre, where they are given medical treatment and advice.Cut-price nail bars have become a cornerstone of the high street, flourishing as more established shops close. In the past 20 years, manicures have gone from being an extravagant luxury mostly enjoyed by a moneyed elite to an affordable treat, easily accessible to everyone. But the public awareness of what the low costs may mean for those who work there remains hazy. It is easier to associate cannabis farms and brothels with exploitation. Operating in plain sight, nail bars seem more improbable fronts for modern slavery it is very hard to link such an innocuous service with such serious crimes.Kevin Hyland, the UK’s first anti-slavery commissioner, who stepped down in 2018, says people remain confused about the presence of exploitation on the high street because they expect trafficking to be hidden. “People see the shops, they’ve been there for years, police cars drive past them, the local authority collects their rubbish, so they assume they can’t be one of the places where modern slavery happens – an offence that carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.” Familiarity can also add a sense of respectability to the premises. “The longer the shop has been there, the more accepted it is,” he says.Unease about the treatment of vulnerable young Vietnamese people in the UK manicure industry, however, has been slowly rising over the past decade. Then, in October, 39 Vietnamese people were found dead in the back of a refrigerated lorry in Essex. Ten were teenagers. Pham Thi Tra My had texted her mother from the lorry: “I’m sorry Mum. My journey abroad hasn’t succeeded. Mum, I love you so much! I’m dying because I can’t breathe.” Anti-trafficking experts believe that they were brought in to the country to work in nail bars, restaurants and cannabis farms. Southwark council has been working with the politan police on inspecting nail bars since last summer, and the operations have been stepped up in the wake of the Essex tragedy. Yet even news of these deaths has done little to dampen customers’ enthusiasm for £10 manicures.The venue in Peckham is one of five in Southwark being raided simultaneously by 100 police officers. The shop’s thin veneer of frivolity is rapidly stripped away. Inside, there is confusion as eight of the 20 officers crowd inside the narrow space between a row of battered, mismatched treatment chairs, where two startled customers are having their nails painted, and a wall lined with rainbow-coloured pots of varnish. “This is a search warrant giving police the authority to search these premises for evidence of human trafficking,” one of the officers announces. The customers hurriedly leave, while police begin attempting to interview the seven members of staff, all of them Vietnamese.Unravelling who is a victim and who might be exploiting them in this kind of scenario is not always easy. And in this operation it is hampered by a decision to allocate just one interpreter to the 25-strong team of police, social workers, immigration officers and council staff squeezed inside the shop and gathering on the pavement outside.The nail-bar workers, who are told by the translator they face questioning, look alarmed, but say nothing. By the window, a boy in a grey top, clearly a teenager, sits on a swivel chair, his hands pressed anxiously between his legs, his feet not quite touching the floor. With the translator elsewhere, two social workers try without success to speak to him.“How old are you? How old are you? You don’t know how old you are? Your age?” one asks, using the time-honoured British technique of communicating with a non-English speaker, of slowly repeating the same question, louder and louder. He replies quietly in Vietnamese, looking unhappy. “How old are you? Do you speak English? I can’t get anything out of him,” she says, with unreasonable irritation.A teenage girl, who, like all the staff, is wearing a grey top, tells officers through the interpreter that she is 17, but says she isn’t actually working in the shop, and has just stopped by to say hello to a friend as she was in the neighbourhood. “Are your parents here? You mum or dad?” a police officer asks. She shakes her head.The only adult man among the staff is very agitated, and repeatedly requests to be allowed to go to the toilet. Police refuse, concerned that he wants to get rid of something incriminating. Instead, he sits gloomily, snipping his nails, dropping the clippings on the floor. An older woman says she is worried about her baby at home, and asks to leave, but she is told that no one can go until checks have been made on everyone’s immigration status she is later arrested. One of the younger women says all the takings (the nail bar accepts only cash) are put in a drawer until the end of the day no one will give a clear answer about how, or how much, they are paid.Outside the shop, more police officers are questioning a tired-looking Vietnamese man who has been peering through the back of the building, then watching proceedings from the other side of the high street and making calls. They ask him to hand over and unlock his phone.“It’s not my phone,” he tells them, speaking Vietnamese to the translator. “Some lady just gave it to me.”“Can you just tell him I’ve never heard such rubbish in my life,” the police officer says, holding the phone in front of the man’s face to see if it would unlock with facial recognition.“Tell him we are going to arrest him on suspicion of theft of a mobile phone.” The man unlocks his phone and officers look through the 20 calls he has made and received during the 45 minutes since the raid began, establishes that a number of calls have been made to staff inside the shop and decide to arrest him on suspicion of involvement in modern slavery and people trafficking.Shortly, another man comes to the shop, pushing a small baby in a pram, and looks through the windows at the staff inside. “Is this your shop?” police ask him. He shakes his head, but when asked to show ID, police recognise him as the man named as the shop’s manager on a notice inside. Another officer takes the pram, handcuffs him and tells him: “You are under arrest for arranging and facilitating modern slavery. We’ll look after the baby, don’t worry.”The mother of the baby has already been taken from the shop to a waiting police car. “He’s been nicked she’s been nicked. Do we bring the baby to the police station?”“We don’t want that. We’ll have to take her into care.”Beneath the pram’s plastic rain cover, the baby peeps out, waving its arms around peacefully.“Is there anyone else who can look after the baby?” a police officer asks the translator to ask the man, adding in an aside: “We’re getting our money’s worth out of you … Ask him: Is there another family member? When does the baby need food and drink?”A lorry driver waiting at the traffic lights by the shop in a truck piled high with scaffolding, shouts: “Let him off!” before driving away, laughing.In total, 13 people working in the five shops are arrested on suspicion of modern slavery and human trafficking offences, and another seven are arrested on suspicion of immigration offences and possessing counterfeit goods, mostly counterfeit cigarettes. Five children and nine adults are deemed to be vulnerable and taken to a temporary reception centre. The council says later that no one was taken into care, because “police weren’t able to establish that any of the young people were children”, although 10 children were found working in Southwark’s nail bars earlier in the year and placed with foster carers. It is unclear what happened to the baby.Mark Rogers, the detective chief inspector leading the operation for the politan police’s central specialist crime unit, says he is happy with how things have gone. “Human trafficking, modern slavery and sexual exploitation often occur in plain sight, and it is often the case those carrying out these offences exploit those from less fortunate backgrounds who have travelled to our country for a better life, in the knowledge these iniduals will carry out hard, labour-intensive work to provide for themselves.”So, how can customers tell if a nail bar is not all it seems? Kevin Hyland recommends looking out for anything that doesn’t look right. “The price is sometimes an indicator but there are other signs.” Are the instructions given through a third party? Are you told: sit here, and that person will do your nails? There should be some ability to interact with the staff does the worker carry on in silence, never removing the protective face mask? Is there a man sitting at the door, behaving in a dominant way?Samantha Sweet, who runs Creative Nail Design, says it is impossible to tell which discount salons are likely to be exploitative. “If we knew more about the discount places I think we would choose different places. Some of them are absolutely fine and employ people legally. But I don’t think the general public think about it they think – well it’s dead cheap and dead quick.” As a benchmark she said the average gel polish treatment should cost at least £25. But, she says “part of the problem is that in the cheaper salons, people don’t talk anyway – they hold out one hand and they’re on their mobile on the other, and then they swap hands.”Millie Kendall, CEO of the British Beauty Council, says two decades ago she only knew of two nail salons in London, but new products, (extensions, fillers, shellac) and the rise of instagram sharing of nail art has made this a rapidly accelerating industry with multiple shops on most high streets. “The business has changed beyond recognition. Nail art has changed the game and made it a more creative industry. The flip side is that we are very under regulated and that’s a real problem for us. Bad products are being used, people get funguses, skin problems and there are slaves.” She hopes the government will move to license the industry.Mark Rogers says he hopes media coverage of the arrests will “continue to raise the public’s awareness of these shocking crimes.” But even when people learn about the issue they tend not to believe it could affect the salon they use it is hard to understand that you could be in such close proximity to someone who has been trafficked, holding your hand, and silently painting bright varnish on your nails.Despite Southwark’s high-profile campaigns, online reviews of other nail bars in the borough continue to reveal how clients’ irritation with the language barrier is carefully weighed up against the joy of a cheap pedicure. Despite the intimacy involved in the treatment, hands and feet being washed and tended to by strangers, many seem remarkably uncurious about the workers, and concern for their welfare seems negligible. One customer writes: “The staff were rude both in person and on the phone, some barely spoke any English, you could clearly see they didn’t want to be doing the job. Got a manicure and pedicure – the job was just about mediocre.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1714cebcf9a0b39efc441204802b50dd0cfb71e/1631_856_2080_1248/master/2080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79f5ba02154ea8ad6fa56c6209b28f31","title":"alarmingly humanoid shear disbelief over restoration of ghent altarpiece","story":"Painstaking operation to return Adoration of the Lamb to its former glory has left many speechlessA restoration of one of the world’s most famous paintings has been described as “a shock for everybody” after it revealed a depiction of a sheep with extremely human-like eyes.The Ghent Altarpiece, completed by Hubert and Jan van Eyck in 1432, is a 15th-century masterpiece in St Bavo’s Cathedral in Belgium, widely considered to be the first major artwork to use oil paint.For centuries, its central panel – titled Adoration of the Mystic Lamb – featured a demure sheep (the Lamb of God) being sacrificed on an altar as a representation of Jesus Christ.The sheep was painted over by a different artist in 1550, but a multi-million-dollar restoration has now revealed the original, startling face of the titular ovine.Described by the Smithsonian Magazine as “alarmingly humanoid”, the new Ghent lamb now sports larger, more vibrant eyes and a more detailed, flared pink nose.Images of the two faces side-by-side have been circulating on social media and described as nightmarish.Unlike other art restorations, such as the infamous botched Ecce Homo (also known as Monkey Christ), the Ghent lamb has in fact been professionally restored to how it originally looked.The head of restoration, Hélène Dubois, described the unveiled face as “cartoonish” and “a shock for everybody” in an interview with The Art Newspaper.“Nothing like this had ever been observed on early Netherlandish painting,” Dubois said.Curators from Belgium’s Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage used surgical scalpels and microscopes to remove old paint “centimetre by centimetre”, over three years, to reveal the original sheep.The institute said their restoration had “brought back the original vividness, richness of detail and brilliant colours for all to see”, concluding that “the Adoration of the Mystic Lamb is overwhelmingly beautiful.”The central panel featuring the lamb will be returned to the cathedral on 24 January, where it will be put on display for the public in an event titled “The return of the Lamb”.The altarpiece is made up of multiple panels, and is 15 feet wide and 11 feet tall when fully opened. It is also one of the most frequently stolen paintings of all time.The restoration was completed in December but images of the sheep’s original face went viral in January.The Ghent lamb now joins other shocking artistic works such as the bust of footballer Cristiano Ronaldo in Madeira in Portugal, the repainted statue of St George in Estella in Spain, and the baby Jesus statue in Ontario in Canada whose head was replaced with a completely differently-coloured material."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f9b0a71f768a0de19be7b78f9a1354c1343c0ca/0_77_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb8f7f64890f9bc9e1a3ba00d5927192","title":"myanmar inquiry into treatment of rohingya criticised after finding no evidence of","story":"Government-appointed investigators failed to meet alleged victims living in Bangladesh A Myanmar government-backed inquiry that dismissed allegations of genocide against the Rohingya has been condemned as a deeply flawed cover-up, after it failed to interview a single victim of rape.The full report of the panel inquiry, which has been criticised by the UN, was not made publicly available. It is not clear how many Rohingya were interviewed by the panel.An executive summary of the findings were released just days before the International Court of Justice, which is hearing a genocide case against Myanmar, is due to announce whether or not it will request for emergency measures to prevent further harm against Rohingya.In 2017, more than 700,000 Rohingya people fled from Myanmar to Bangladesh following a military-led crackdown in Rakhine state in which villages were burned, women raped and thousands killed. A UN fact-finding mission later declared that the violence had “genocidal intent”.The long-overdue report by the Myanmar-appointed inquiry stated that it did not travel to meet any of the more than one million Rohingya refugees living in refugee camps in Bangladesh, blaming the neighbouring country’s government for failing to facilitate visits.The panel concluded that “war crimes and serious human rights violations, and violations of domestic law took place”, and that there are “reasonable grounds” to conclude members of the security forces among “multiple actors” responsible.These acts included the “killing of innocent villagers and destruction of their homes”, it said.But it added that attacks by Rohingya militants provoked this response, and that such violence was “triggered by inidual fear, enmity, and historical grievances rather than by a plan, design or order.” “There is insufficient evidence to argue, much less conclude, that the crimes committed were undertaken with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, or with any other requisite mental state for the international crime of genocide,” it said.Among its findings, the panel inquiry stated that it had heard “no credible statements on allegations of gang rape committed by Myanmar’s security forces”, and that no iniduals interviewed by the panel alleged that they had been raped.Some female witnesses told the inquiry they had been searched by male Myanmar defence personnel as part of operations, the panel said, adding: “This behaviour may amount to constitute sexual violence.”The findings on sexual violence - which are detailed in just four sentences - are in stark contrast to the conclusions of a recent UN fact-finding mission. Last August, the UN concluded that “soldiers routinely and systematically employed rape, gang rape and other violent and forced sexual acts against women, girls, boys, men and transgender people”. The UN described such violence as a blatant violation of international human rights law.Radhakrishnan added that by admitting some abuses took place, the report appeared to be attempting to reassure the international community, and that the timing of the report was significant. “This is their way of saying we have this impartial independent process - you need to leave domestic accountability to us,” she said.Ullah said the more than 700,000 people who fled to Bangladesh in August 2017 were proof that the Myanmar government and military has had too much impunity and is not capable of investigating itself. “This is the hard proof.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4147215.1579643737!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"some 45 000 taken off waiting lists last year without seeing medical specialist","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe NTPF  said as part of its validation   process patients were written to in order to confirm they still required hospital care, and if they did not respond a second letter was  sentMore than 45,000 people were removed from outpatient waiting lists without ever seeing a medical specialist last year.Just under half of these requested to be taken off the hospital outpatient waiting list as part of an official exercise to check whether they still required a medical specialist consultation – suggesting that about 24,000 names were removed after failing to respond to letters sent out as part of this process.New figures show that there was a major intensification of the waiting list validation process in the second half of last year carried out by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).In January last year just over 420 people were removed from outpatient waiting lists.In May the number had increased to more than 4,000, and in June there were over 5,700 people removed from the outpatient waiting list.The Government has said better validation will mean other patients get seen quicker, and will reduce the number of no-shows for appointments.Overall more than 236,000 people on outpatient waiting lists were contacted as part of the validation process last year.Stephen McMahon of the Irish Patients Association said he had no issue with patients being removed from waiting lists on their own request, but he had “concerns” over cases where they were taken off the list for failing to respond to validation letters.“We have to be sure every hospital is adhering to NTPF guidelines,” he said, adding that some patients were waiting so long to be seen that they ended up having to go to hospital emergency departments for treatment.ValidationTramore GP Austin Byrne said the “main problem” was with patients getting removed from waiting lists for failing to respond to letters. However, the NTPF had streamlined the process to “good effect” since it took over validation from hospitals in 2018, and the “big push” to remove patients from lists appeared to be over, he added.Dublin GP Ray Walley said some patients struggled to engage with the validation process, and “there could be a bit more humanity in it”.The NTPF said it worked to deliver shorter waiting times for consultant appointments and surgery.It said as part of the process patients were written to in order to confirm they still required hospital care, and if they did not respond a second letter was then sent.“If the patient fails to respond to the second letter or requests removal the patient’s hospital is informed. Following review by the hospital, where appropriate a decision is then taken whether to remove the patient from the waiting list in compliance with national protocols.”GPs are also informed, and patients can be placed back on the list for the original date.Medical specialistDetails of the scale of the numbers removed from the waiting lists for outpatient appointments come as the outgoing Government has maintained – accurately – that the numbers queueing to see a medical specialist are falling for the first time in a number of years.The number of patients waiting for an outpatient appointment fell in December by 10,000, the biggest single-month drop seen in several years. The NTPF figures show the validation process was a major contributor to this reduction.There were 553,434 outpatients on the waiting list at the end of the month, according to figures released by the NTPF earlier this month."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4147625.1579676587!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"which jobs do teenage girls and boys aspire to have by age 30","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMore than 500,000 15-year-old students in 79 countries and economic areas were assessed on topics such as about the occupation they expect to be in by the age of 30 as part of the OECD study. Image: iStock. The occupation teenage girls most aspire to work in by the time they are 30 is medicine, while the top career choice for teenage boys is engineering, a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) finds.The study ‘Dream Jobs? Teenagers’ Career Aspirations and the Future of Work’, features analysis from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) on the kinds of careers boys and girls expect for themselves and the extent to which their aspirations align with a fast changing job market.More than 500,000 15-year-old students in 79 countries and economic areas were assessed on topics such as about the occupation they expect to be in by the age of 30.Becoming a doctor was the most aspired-to career among girls who took part in the study. This was followed by teaching and business management. Training to be a lawyer, nurse or midwife, psychologist, designer, veterinarian, police officer and architect were also among the popular careers mentioned by girls.Some 60 per cent of female Irish respondents to the study said they expected to work in one of the top 10 most commonly cited jobs by the time they turn 30.Forty-nine per cent of Irish boys said they expected to work in one of the 10 most commonly cited jobs by age 30, which included engineering, business managerment, medicine and ICT. Other career aspirations mentioned by boys included being a sportsperson, teaching, joining a police force, being a motor vehicle mechanic, a lawyer or an architect.BackgroundsThe report says that children of more advantaged families are more likely to want to go on to university than young working class people. The study found that high-performing young people from the most disadvantaged backgrounds were nearly four times less likely to hold high aspirations than similarly performing young people from the most privileged backgrounds.Career thinking is often also driven by gender and immigrant background, according to the research.Among high performers in mathematics or science, for example, boys were much more likely than girls to express an interest in becoming a scientist or engineer. The reverse was true for health-related careers, which girls favoured.The risk of automation varies between countries. In Ireland and the United Kingdom, around 35 per cent of the jobs cited by students are at risk of automation, on average, whereas in Germany, Greece and Japan, more than 45 per cent of jobs cited are at risk.Careers mentioned by disadvantaged students in Ireland had more of a risk of being automated than those desired by more affluent students and the career aspirations cited by boys in Ireland face a higher risk of job automation than those cited by girls.Teenage students who worked part-time alongside their full-time education were far more likely to experience a range of positive benefits including higher wages, greater chances of pursuing apprenticeships and contentment in their career progression, the study says."},{"url":null,"title":"election 2020 strong economy not enough for voters who want hard signs of prosperity","story":"An economy that is the envy of Europe, at least in terms of GDP growth in recent years, is not translating into votes for Fine Gael, the party that has overseen a revival in our economic fortunes.

File photograph: Cyril ByrneThe Today is the final day to register to vote for people who wish to cast a ballot in the upcoming general election, with the deadline being the close of business in local authority offices. If you are not already on the electoral register, you can be added to the supplementary register, but your application must be received 15 days before polling day (not including Sundays or public holidays), which is Wednesday. In order to be included on the supplementary register, a RFA2 form must be downloaded online and then brought to a Garda station, along with photo ID. The form must be signed in the presence of a member of the force who will then stamp it, and then it must be delivered to the relevant local authority. As the deadline is close of business on Wednesday, which is in most cases 5pm, you will have to bring your signed form in person to the local authority office rather than post it. The electoral register is updated each year with all those who registered in the previous 12 months. There was controversy over the chosen date of the general election, 8th February, as the register is not due to be updated until the following week on 15th February. This led to concerns thousands of people who had registered to vote through the normal route over the past year, in particular before the local and European elections last May, would not be eligible to vote in the general election. Those in doubt can visit checktheregister.ie to see if their details are included on the 2019-2020 electoral register.Voters whose details are not listed are advised to contact their local authority and to see if they are already on the supplementary register of electors. If not they have until the close of business on Wednesday to register. In recent days, about 2,000 students across several colleges and third-level institutions registered to vote in the upcoming election, according to the Union of Students in Ireland (USI). On Tuesday, Dublin City Council offices stayed open late until 7pm to allow people to register, and local authority staff in the Wood Quay office will be on hand until 5pm on Wednesday. Before the dissolution of the Dáil, the Government approved draft legislation to overhaul the voter registration process, to modernise the system with a rolling register rather than one updated annually. The legislation proposes changes to the identity verification process as well as an online registration system.AccessMeanwhile, a disability advocate has described to lack of access for wheelchair users in 63 polling stations around the country as “apartheid in another form”.There is a legal obligation under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which Ireland recently ratified, to ensure that everyone has ease of access to vote, he told Newstalk Breakfast on Wednesday. “There is no excuse in 2020. This is something that has been obvious for some time. It should not be beyond the ability of returning officers to make polling stations accessible,” he said. Mr Delaney pointed out that during the recent election in the UK, portacabins with wheelchair ramps were used at polling stations where necessary to allow access for wheelchair users.At present if a wheelchair user turns up to vote and finds the polling station inaccessible they have to speak to the returning officer and then “toddle off” to a different accessible polling station, Mr Delaney said.This was the same as telling members of other minority groups that they could not enter a polling station, he said.

The margin of error is estimated at 2.8 per cent.There are significant regional variations in the importance that voters attach to the various issues. Voters in Munster and ConnachtUlster are much more concerned about health, for instance, than their counterparts in Dublin.In Dublin, 30 per cent of respondents cite health as the issue which will most influence their vote, but in Munster it is 50 per cent and in ConnachtUlster it’s 47 per cent. Rural voters in general (47 per cent) are more likely to cite health as the number one issue than urban voters (37 per cent). The oldest voters are also overwhelmingly more concerned about the health issue (60 per cent) than the average.Dublin is the only region where voters attach more importance to housing (34 per cent) than health, and voters in the capital are also more concerned about the economy (12 per cent) and climate change (12 per cent) than voters in the rest of the country. The most well-off voters (18 per cent) are also significantly more concerned about climate change than less well-off voters. Among the supporters of different parties, Fianna Fáil voters (51 per cent) are most concerned with health while Fine Gael supporters are most likely to mention the economy as the number one issue. Even then, however, just 15 per cent of Fine Gael voters nominate the economy as the most important issue.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"irish times poll large majority want change of government","story":"Three-quarters of voters say they want to see a change of government at the general election, according to the latest Ipsos MRBI opinion poll.More than half of voters (55 per cent) say the country is going in the wrong direction.

Photograph: Nick Bradshaw for The Eamon Ryan is on Bull Island.Aren’t they all these days? There’s an election on.No. The Green Party leader is really there – strolling along Dollymount beach in the famous nature reserve having just launched his party’s policy on bioersity. When he says the island and its wildlife is under pressure from plastic pollution, sewage outflow, habitat loss and rising sea levels caused by climate breakdown, he isn’t talking bull.The Greens chose this tiny corner of Dublin because its problems point up the dangerous pressures on our living planet today. According to scientists (and the preamble to this policy document) the “sixth mass extinction event, labelled the ‘Anthropocene extinction’, is currently under way”, with experts estimating that global wildlife populations have declined by 40 per cent in the past 40 years.Ryan and his team, including general election candidates Cllr David Healy (Dublin Bay North) and Cllr Caroline Conroy (Dublin North-West), arrive at the dunes in a hired minivan and head down to the sea.It is a bracing January morning. The rain is misty and the glorious sky a luminous grey. Apart from some specks on the horizon, they have the beckoning strand to themselves.The tide is in. Eamon walks alone towards the water’s edge. “It’s like the start of Reginald Perrin,” he muses, staring out at the white-topped waves.Ah here. Reggie Perrin was a 1970s sitcom character who faked his own death by leaving his clothes and personal effects behind on a beach and disappearing.Fake disappearance dipEven allowing for understandable worries over the Anthropocene extinction, vanishing curlews and plastic particles in the food chain, Eamon is due to hand in his nomination papers on Wednesday, so a fake disappearance dip off Dollymount – no matter how tempting – was out of the question.That aside, he seemed remarkably chipper under the circumstances.This was probably down to Tuesday’s  poll which had the party at 8 per cent nationally and 15 per cent in Dublin. “Cautiously optimistic” was the feeling just under three weeks from polling day.“We were pleased because we are doing well and we can feel it. It’s a cliche, I know, but I was around the country yesterday, in Kildare, Kilkenny and Waterford, and it’s the same story in each of those constituencies and around Dublin. We are getting a really good response.”Pleased with the campaign, taking nothing for granted, much to live up to and a lot of work ahead of them before the big day. All the usual stuff.Back to the beach. The issue of bioersity and climate change – “the two really go together” – must be tackled, say the Greens. This is their mission. The party has come up with a range of practical measures to stop and reverse the destruction of Ireland’s plant and animal population. Coalition suitors will have to consider them.Crisis is realIt’s an “ambitious” list because the crisis is real, stressed the former minister for communications and natural resources. “The fact that we’ve lost half of all wildlife in the last 15 years, that so many of our bird species are threatened – same with our bees, same with all our insects, our very soil, the health of our soil is at risk – means decisive action must be taken.”But hang on a minute here, Eamon Ryan. Your election posters aren’t even eco-friendly. How do you plead?“Eh, they aren’t.”However, he has been reusing them – three election outings so far for what’s left of the old crop. Think Dorian Gray, without the attic or opium habit. After the election, in the spirit of recycling, Eamon is hoping to become a bucket. Or maybe a collapsible table. Where his posters are concerned, he tries to reduce and reuse.“They are all recycled afterwards and I think they turn most of them into garden furniture.”During a general election, the downside of campaigning on a deserted beach is the lack of voters to canvass. Although he met a lady called Beatrice and a large gentleman called Bear, who were so very pleased and excited to meet the leader of the Greens they had to sniff him all over. It’s a terrible pity dogs can’t vote.Their owner, Dr David Quish, can, though. A geographer, he taught for many years in Santa Sabina girls’ school in nearby Sutton. David and Eamon, Bear and Beatrice all agree that the Bull Island is a wonderful resource. “A fascinating example of the sequence of land formation,” said David.Up in the beakAnd what about the crows? Isn’t it great the way they fly high in the air with a mussel and then drop it down on the ground to open it? That’s what they do on the southside in Sandymount anyway, marvelled Eamon. Up in the beak and down until the shell cracks.Well, said David, the crows in Dollymount “have a sense of tidiness”. He has observed how they have little areas, almost as if “this is our rubbish place and we don’t drop them everywhere. So they have places which are sort of disposal spots for them.”If only people could be as conscientious.Would he vote Green?“Certainly I would.”He said he read a report on how large areas of the natural world are rapidly disappearing and it “shocked me into reality”.The challenges posed by climate change are vast and complex. The Green leader and his candidates are very knowledgeable on the subject and can, and do, hold forth at length on it. In this era of bite-sized information and an election of brief doorstep encounters, it might help if the main message is easily imparted.“‘Want Green? Vote Green’ is our election slogan because if you want all these measures that we are talking about, then you have to vote Green,” says Eamon. He has been using his favourite slogan for ages but thinks it is as relevant now as when first he said it: “Think Globally, Act Locally.”Age profileFor the party to do well on election day, it is generally believed that younger people have to turn out, although the recent poll suggests a broader support base in terms of age profile.For Eamon Ryan, “the critical thing is will they turn up to vote.” He reckons it will be a very good day if young people realise they can vote for what future they want. “If we don’t address this crisis they will be living in a planet where it’s not possible to manage . . . Once nature goes beyond a certain point, you can’t bring it back.”If the slide isn’t reversed those young people “may grow up in a world where nature is denuded, where they will never experience what we’ve been fortunate to grow up with, living with a landscape that’s really rich and alive. And that is why they should go out and vote.”Not for the first time, and, we suspect, not for the last time, Eamon mentioned one of the shining lights in the global battle to arrest bioersity loss.“Let’s do this in honour of David Attenborough.”He’ll have Greta out on the canvass next.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Concerns over spread of illness with many in China travelling to celebrate Lunar New YearSixth death in China where wider outbreak feared as hundreds of millions begin travelling for lunar new yearHealth commission confirms that coronavirus can spread from person to personCricket ball-sized hail stones smash windows and see residents sledding through streetsOver 60 cases of novel coronavirus identified in Wuhan amid fears it could spread furtherXi Jinping\u0026rsquos name appeared as \u0026ldquoMr S**thole when translated into EnglishAuthorities still battling nearly 100 fires despite heavy rain in eastern parts of countryUS to screen passengers at three major airports arriving on flights from WuhanRescuers save 30 trekkers following incident on Annapurna circuitFacial hair of diplomat, who has Japanese heritage, reminds Koreans of colonisationMany young couples reluctant to have children due to costs orce rates hit recordMelbourne braces for another wave of unhealthy air over weekend\u0026lsquoThese pines outlived the dinosaurs \u0026ndash we had to do everything we could to save them\u0026rsquoBushfires dampened in New South Wales as thunderstorms cause flooding in MelbourneIndustry that has long supported India\u0026rsquos PM and pro-Hindu agenda begins risky rebellionForeign minister pushes back after re-election of pro-independence Tsai Ing-WenThai health minister says it is first confirmed case of virus found outside ChinaAuthorities warn \u0026lsquohazardous eruption\u0026rsquo is possible \u0026lsquowithin hours or days\u0026rsquoVillagers evacuated near Taal volcano south of ManilaAuthorities struggling to clear road after heavy snowfall, rains and flash floods"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4147618.1579678821!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus public health emergency expected to be declared","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPassengers wearing face masks who arrived from Guangzhou, China gather at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, Philippines on Wednesday. At least nine people have died and more than 400 people are confirmed infected by the coronavirus which was first detected in Wuhan, China. Photograph: Mark R CristinoEPA.The World Health Organisation (WHO) is expected to declare a public health emergency of international concern in response to the coronavirus outbreak which appears to have originated in eastern China. The death toll from the new flu-like illness in China rose to nine on Wednesday with 440 confirmed cases. Authorities have stepped up efforts to control the outbreak by discouraging public gatherings in Hubei province.Another 2,197 people who came into contact with infected people were isolated, with 765 so far released, China’s National Health Commission vice-minister Li Bin told reporters, adding that there was already evidence that the virus was being spread through “respiratory transmission”.“Recently there has been a big change in the number of cases, which is related to our deepening our understanding of the disease, improving diagnostic methods and optimising the distribution of diagnostic kits.”As China vowed to tighten containment measures in hospitals, the WHO was due to hold an emergency meeting to determine whether the outbreak of the coronavirus constitutes a global health emergency.The virus, originating in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei at the end of last year, has spread to Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Macau, as well as the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.Public panicThe Chinese government has been providing daily updates on the number of cases in an effort to head off public panic, as millions of people prepare to travel domestically and abroad for the country’s Lunar New Year celebrations starting this week.“At present, during the Lunar New Year, the rise in the mobility of the public has objectively increased the risk of the epidemic spreading and the difficulty of prevention and control,” Ms Li warned, noting that the mutation of the virus could also bring further risks.Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of Apple supplier Foxconn, said on Wednesday that he was advising company employees not to visit China over the coming Lunar New Year holiday, amid concerns over the virus.Fears of a pandemic similar to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) outbreak that started in China and killed nearly 800 people in 2002-2003 have roiled global markets, with aviation and luxury goods stocks hit particularly hard and the Chinese yuan tumbling.On Tuesday the death toll stood at six with about 300 confirmed cases.WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said new cases of the coronavirus would appear as China stepped up monitoring.Ms Li said there was as yet no evidence of “super-spreaders” capable of disseminating the virus more widely, as happened during the Sars outbreak.SymptomsFifteen medical personnel are among those infected in China. Symptoms include fever, coughing and difficulty breathing. The viral infection can cause pneumonia and be passed from person to person.Though the origin of the virus has yet to be identified, the WHO said the primary source was probably animal. Chinese officials have linked the outbreak to Wuhan’s seafood market.The new virus was adapting and mutating, underscoring the challenges for health authorities in controlling the outbreak, Gao Fu, the director-general of China’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, told a news briefing.Taiwan’s president Tsai Ing-wen called on China on Wednesday to share “correct” information about a new coronavirus and for the WHO not to exclude Taiwan from collaboration on the outbreak for political reasons.Taiwan is not a member of the WHO due to the objection of China, which considers the island a Chinese province with no right to participate in international organisations unless it accepts it is part of China.The WHO has issued the public health emergency of international concern declaration on four previous occasions. The first declaration was in April 2009, with H1N1, or swine flu, spreading around the world and killing more than 200,000 people.Britain recorded 214 deaths, while 20 people died from swine flu in Ireland.Initially travellers returning from Mexico, where the virus originated, were met by authorities at the airport and hygiene measures were recommended.Increased wild polio numbers in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria led to an emergency being declared in May 2014, a remarkable step given that the disease was thought to have been almost eradicated.The deadly disease broke out in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, with an emergency declared from August 2014 to March 2016. Almost 30,000 people were infected and more than 11,000 died.The UK made a significant contribution after the outbreak by working with the Wellcome Trust on an experimental vaccine which the European Medicines Agency approved to treat Ebola in November last year.A vaccination programme is under way in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s (DRC) North Kivu province.A second emergency was declared, after months of hesitation, last July after it was confirmed that Ebola had spread to Goma, the capital of North Kivu, where DRC’s international airport is located.The life-threatening virus was first identified in a monkey in Uganda in 1975.Its spread by mosquitoes in the Americas led the WHO to declare it an emergency from February to November 2016.The first emergency from a mosquito-borne disease is thought to have been responsible for 2,000 possible cases of birth defects and 29 infant deaths in Brazil. - ReutersAP"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4145269.1579516519!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit eu citizens want physical card to prove right to stay in uk","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA report found nine out of 10 EU citizens in the UK would prefer a card over digital evidence  of their rights. File photograph: Will OlivierEPAThe British government is facing fresh calls to issue EU citizens with a physical document to prove they have the right to stay in the country after Brexit.A report found nine out of 10 EU citizens in the UK would prefer a card over the digital evidence they have now to demonstrate their rights in future to employers, banks or landlords.Fears over discrimination, loss of identity and a continuing lack of trust in the government’s willingness to deliver guaranteed lifetime rights emerged as serious concerns in the research – the biggest survey of EU, European Economic Area (EEA) and Swiss citizens in the UK to date.Tanja Bueltmann, a professor at Northumbria University who designed and conducted the poll along with the campaign group the3million, said: “The survey documents, without question, we have an ‘unsettling status’.“This extends beyond the application process, revealing an erosion of trust an erosion of wellbeing and an erosion of the sense of belonging among survey respondents.“The government has a duty to finally give EUEEA and Swiss citizens certainty. Hollow words are not enough.”The findings came just days after the government gave the European parliament’s Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, reassurances that EU citizens would not be automatically deported if they failed to apply for the settled status scheme.The survey, published on Monday, found that nine in 10 of those polled were unhappy about the lack of a physical document to demonstrate their right to remain in the country after they had been granted settled status or pre-settled status.As many as 11 per cent said they had already been asked for settled status proof, even though this is not legally required.This echoes a warning by private landlords that tenants could face discrimination because of the lack of a physical document.On the plus side, many of those surveyed reported a positive experience of the settled status app, with a majority of respondents saying the application process worked well.As many as 97.1 per cent of the 3,171 valid responses to the survey said they had received the status decision they expected.However, the emotional response to having to apply and the consequences of being labelled as someone with “settled status” was largely adverse. The words most frequently used by respondents to describe their feelings were “angry”, “anxious” and “unwanted”.Even those who had already been granted settled status felt worse off, with 80 per cent either strongly agreeing or agreeing that they felt anxious.Eight out of 10 said the process made them stressed and many thought citizenship was far more secure.Maike Bohn, co-founder of the3million, said the report underlined the lack of trust after three years of mixed messages.“Are we the much-quoted ‘neighbours, colleagues, friends’ or are we the ‘queue jumpers, benefits scroungers, unwelcome guests, draining the NHS’?“The government needs to step up local outreach and support, both to EUEEA and Swiss citizens but also to employers, landlords and others who will be forced to check the immigration status of these citizens in order to avoid huge fines.”The British Home Office said the scheme was working and a digital solution was better than a physical document. “This digital status future-proofs their rights and is linked to their passport or ID card, replacing physical documents which can get lost, stolen, damaged, tampered with and expire,” it said.–Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

His celebrity crush is Lily James.Meanwhile, the show has been sponsored by fast fashion brands (Missguided and then I Saw it First) for the last three years, giving viewers the opportunity to shop the female Islanders’ looks directly. Personally, I’ve always thought that Love Island contestants dress terribly: it’s Benidorm beaches meets Kardashian kitsch. But with prices starting at £5, the clothes are devastatingly cheap. Far cheaper than the designer garb we see on most TV stars. So I can understand the appeal. But I also know that every time someone buys one of those bikinis, or sparkly bodycon dresses, they’re adding fuel to fast fashion’s ever-blazing fire.But perhaps the onus is not on the consumer, or even the Love Island star. Lauren Bravo, author of How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, explains that the brands are the ones who should really be shouldering responsibility here. “These days we’re so used to instant gratification, and the idea that anyone can aspire to celebrity, that it seems reasonable for TV stars to sell us clothes and vice versa,” she tells me. “And it’s really hard, because I know what it’s like to love fashion and crave the clothes you’re seeing on people you admire, not to mention the huge social pressures on young people to keep that endless parade of new looks rolling over on their Instagram grid, so telling people who can’t necessarily afford to spend any more that their shopping habits are destroying the planet can feel snobbish and unfair.”Why I\u0027m giving up fast fashion #20PledgesBut, Bravo adds, the fact remains that those clothes simply cannot be made as cheaply as they’re sold. Somewhere down the line, someone is paying the price, whether it’s a garment worker barely surviving on poverty wages or a community grappling with industrial pollution.That’s not to say you can’t “get the Islander look” in a sustainable and eco-friendly way. Bravo suggests heading to secondhand shopping apps, like Depop, where you’ll find plenty of pre-loved items not dissimilar from the ones you see on the show. Some of them will be from fast fashion brands, but if you’re buying it there, you’re keeping that item in circulation as opposed to letting it wind up in landfill.\u0026nbspOr, you could take a closer look at some of the trends championed by Love Islanders, both past and present, and see that many (cycling shorts, mesh, high-waisted jeans and leopard print) hark back to another era, like, say, the 1990s. And what better way to shop Nineties fashion than by heading to your local Beyond Retro or Rokit, which will be jam-packed with original clothing from the decade that is not only more sustainable, but a hell of a lot cooler, too.How to Break Up with Fast Fashion by Lauren Bravo (£12.99, Headline Home) is out nowOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It may have meant that users would encrypt their backups, lose their password and then get locked out of restoring their phone, for instance.But the move has come to light amid an ongoing fight between Apple and the US government, over whether the company should be forced to help break into its own phones.Something has happened to Apple\u0027s AirPods performance, users sayOfficials including Donald Trump and US\u0026nbspAttorney General William Barr have attacked Apple over their refusal to help investigators break into two iPhones\u0026nbspused by a Saudi Air Force officer who shot dead three Americans at a\u0026nbspPensacola, Florida naval base last month.Apple argues that doing so would require creating a version of the iOS software that would be inherently unsafe, and would weaken the protection on every phone. The government has suggested that would be a worthwhile compromise to provide information in investigations.Despite the criticism from US lawmakers, Apple has argued that it has provided help in the Pensacola case, rejecting the idea it has not provided substantive assistance. It said that it turned over iCloud backups, which include personal data such as photos.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”.

One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw.

(AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in.

Meanwhile, employment far outstripped expectations, hitting an all-time high of 76.3 per cent.The news has thrown uncertainty into the works, as the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets the rates, is due to meet next week.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt had been widely expected to cut the interest rate, but the new data could give members pause for thought, experts said.“The continued resilience of the labour market increases the chances that the MPC will take a rain check next week, instead of cutting bank rate immediately,” said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.Created with Sketch.

With interest rates near to historical lows, there is little to be gained from further rate cuts. Instead the focus should be on using the upcoming Budget to support firms looking to recruit and grow their business,” said Mr Thiru.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

New York native Iliza Shlesinger brings a fresh take on topics from modern dating to wedding planning headaches. Her show is a delightful mix of reality checks and insightful takes.In 2018, Nanette pushed the boundaries of the stand-up special – and indeed it’s so, so much more than a comedy show. In a little more than an hour, Hannah Gadsby deconstructs the makings of a good joke, explains why she’s done with self-deprecation, and delivers an unforgettable, incredibly powerful take on the trauma she’s experienced as a lesbian in Tasmania.Standout line: “I have built a career out of self-deprecating humour and I don’t want to do that anymore. Do you understand what self-deprecation means when it comes from somebody who already exists in the margins? It’s not humility, it\u0027s humiliation. I put myself down in order to speak, in order to seek permission to speak, and I simply will not do that anymore. Not to myself or anybody who identifies with me.”If you liked Ali Wong in Always Be My Maybe (which she co-wrote!), then you’re going to love her in Hard Knock Wife (her second Netflix special and a follow-up on her 2016 debut Baby Cobra). Her unapologetic takes on motherhood and marriage (did you know she makes a lot more money than her husband and she’s not sorry?) are gold.Standout line: “Now, I make a lot more money than my husband by, like, a long shot. My mom is very concerned that he’s going to leave me out of intimidation. I had to explain to her that the only kind of man who would leave a woman who makes more money… is the kind of man that doesn’t like free money.”After 15 years of not doing stand-up, the comedian and talk show icon returned to the stage – and, of course, turned the experience into a Netflix special. Under the pretence of pondering whether she’s still relatable, Ellen DeGeneres basks in the (well-earned) glory her accomplishments, reflects on her personal experiences – including her 1997 coming-out and how it was received in Hollywood – and riffs on the absurdities of daily life. What a treat.510 Son of Patricia, Trevor NoahTrevor Noah has been starring in comedy specials for a decade, so it’s no surprise that he can take just about any topic (tourism in Bali, trap music, a conversation with President Barack Obama) and turn it into incisive jokes.Katherine Ryan’s second Netflix special (the follow-up to In Trouble, which came out in 2017) tackles some of her trademark topics, from dating to co-parenting, in a lighthearted, self-affirming way. A delight through and through.Back in 2012, Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino, was appearing as the unforgettable Troy Barnes in Community – and spared a little time to record a Netflix special, which remains available to this day. Throughout this one-hour show, he shows off his range, reflecting on his music career, reaching his late twenties, and that brief time when the internet really wanted him to play Spider-Man.Standout line: “I lived in Downtown LA, and Downtown LA is kind of like the Eighties decided to stay there. They’re like, ‘Oh, OK, you guys go ahead and be the Nineties. Go enjoy Ace of Base – we’ll be here practicing the Moonwalk and selling crack.’”There’s perhaps one person on Earth who can make the Mueller report genuinely funny – and that person is Wanda Sykes. The comedian might be best known for her roles on Curb Your Enthusiasm and Black-ish, but her stand-up is well worth a watch. She has impeccable timing, sharp writing, and an apparently effortless ability to connect with her crowd.Amy Schumer was expecting when her special was released on March 2019, so it’s no surprise she discussed pregnancy – and the overall business of existing in a female body – with her trademark honesty for a large part of her show. This special is actually made up of two shows, Dark and Jigsaw. The Scottish comedian refreshes the “fish out of water” archetype by delivering his take on the US – and that time he told a joke about being an atheist in Indiana. His smart writing enables him to tackle topics, such as disability and – yes – paedophilia, in a way few comics could pull off.Standout line: “As a parent – no, I’m not a parent, but I like speaking for other people, because I’m white, middle-class and male, and that’s what my people do.”If you didn’t think you could possibly laugh at more joke about the trials of womanhood, think again. New York native Iliza Shlesinger brings a fresh take on topics from modern dating to wedding planning headaches. Her show is a delightful mix of reality checks and insightful takes.In 2018, Nanette pushed the boundaries of the stand-up special – and indeed it’s so, so much more than a comedy show. In a little more than an hour, Hannah Gadsby deconstructs the makings of a good joke, explains why she’s done with self-deprecation, and delivers an unforgettable, incredibly powerful take on the trauma she’s experienced as a lesbian in Tasmania.Standout line: “I have built a career out of self-deprecating humour and I don’t want to do that anymore. Do you understand what self-deprecation means when it comes from somebody who already exists in the margins? It’s not humility, it\u0027s humiliation. I put myself down in order to speak, in order to seek permission to speak, and I simply will not do that anymore. Not to myself or anybody who identifies with me.”If you liked Ali Wong in Always Be My Maybe (which she co-wrote!), then you’re going to love her in Hard Knock Wife (her second Netflix special and a follow-up on her 2016 debut Baby Cobra). Her unapologetic takes on motherhood and marriage (did you know she makes a lot more money than her husband and she’s not sorry?) are gold.Standout line: “Now, I make a lot more money than my husband by, like, a long shot. My mom is very concerned that he’s going to leave me out of intimidation. I had to explain to her that the only kind of man who would leave a woman who makes more money… is the kind of man that doesn’t like free money.”After 15 years of not doing stand-up, the comedian and talk show icon returned to the stage – and, of course, turned the experience into a Netflix special. Under the pretence of pondering whether she’s still relatable, Ellen DeGeneres basks in the (well-earned) glory her accomplishments, reflects on her personal experiences – including her 1997 coming-out and how it was received in Hollywood – and riffs on the absurdities of daily life. What a treat.510 Son of Patricia, Trevor NoahTrevor Noah has been starring in comedy specials for a decade, so it’s no surprise that he can take just about any topic (tourism in Bali, trap music, a conversation with President Barack Obama) and turn it into incisive jokes.Katherine Ryan’s second Netflix special (the follow-up to In Trouble, which came out in 2017) tackles some of her trademark topics, from dating to co-parenting, in a lighthearted, self-affirming way. A delight through and through.Back in 2012, Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino, was appearing as the unforgettable Troy Barnes in Community – and spared a little time to record a Netflix special, which remains available to this day. Throughout this one-hour show, he shows off his range, reflecting on his music career, reaching his late twenties, and that brief time when the internet really wanted him to play Spider-Man.Standout line: “I lived in Downtown LA, and Downtown LA is kind of like the Eighties decided to stay there. They’re like, ‘Oh, OK, you guys go ahead and be the Nineties. Go enjoy Ace of Base – we’ll be here practicing the Moonwalk and selling crack.’”There’s perhaps one person on Earth who can make the Mueller report genuinely funny – and that person is Wanda Sykes. The comedian might be best known for her roles on Curb Your Enthusiasm and Black-ish, but her stand-up is well worth a watch. She has impeccable timing, sharp writing, and an apparently effortless ability to connect with her crowd.Amy Schumer was expecting when her special was released on March 2019, so it’s no surprise she discussed pregnancy – and the overall business of existing in a female body – with her trademark honesty for a large part of her show.

We can’t wait to see what Gary does with a bigger canvas to paint on than just a 1:1 square.The official synopsis reads: “Before George rules Britannia, he’ll be laying down his own laws in Janetti’s comedic take on the future King of England’s childhood as seen from the prince’s own point of view.“Because his succession isn’t coming any time soon, in each episode George will find his path in life as a young prince in modern times – from the 775 rooms of Buckingham Palace to his family’s sea of corgis to primary school with commoners.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the impact craters they would have come out of could not be identified.Now scientists say they have precisely dated the\u0026nbspYarrabubba crater, giving a specific age for the impact structure long regarded as one of the world\u0027s oldest.The meteorite hit the Earth 2.229 billion years ago, give or take five million years, the researchers said.Crater from one of the largest meteorites to hit Earth ‘discovered\u0027At that time, in the same region, glaciers would have been forming and the Earth was largely covered in ice. Simulations suggest that if the meteorite that formed the crater hit a continental ice sheet, it would have thrown as much as\u0026nbsp5,000 trillion kilograms of water vapour up into the atmosphereThat could have fundamentally changed the Earth\u0027s climate, the scientists note. It might even have created a greenhouse effect that brought an end to the period known as Snowball Earth that covered our planet when the meteorite arrived.“Yarrabubba, which sits between Sandstone and Meekatharra in central WA, had been recognised as an impact structure for many years, but its age wasn’t well determined,” said\u0026nbspCurtin University\u0027s Chris Kirkland, one of the authors of the study.“Now we know the Yarrabubba crater was made right at the end of what’s commonly referred to as the early Snowball Earth – a time when the atmosphere and oceans were evolving and becoming more oxygenated and when rocks deposited on many continents recorded glacial conditions”.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Last year, TikTok overtook Instagram to become the fourth most-downloaded app – beaten only by Facebook, Messenger and WhatsApp.Since it launched in 2016, TikTok has been downloaded more than 1.5 billion times through Google Play and Apple’s App Store, according to figures from app analytics firm Sensor Tower.Instagram has recently made attempts to be less focussed on status, such as hiding the amount of likes a post receives.It also launched a new tool called Reels that borrows some of TikTok\u0027s most popular features​, including the ability to create 15-second music videos. The feature is currently only available in Brazil but will roll out more widely if it proves to be popular.Mark Zuckerberg’s secret plan to crush TikTokFacebook\u0027s concern about the rising popularity of TikTok was outlined in a recently leaked staff meeting, during which CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined his plan of attack for taking on its new rival.“I think we have time to learn and understand and get ahead of the trend,” he said. “The space is still fairly nascent, and there’s time for us to kind of figure out what we want to do here.”Facebook and Instagram have\u0026nbspconsistently been accused of borrowing features from rival apps, including self-destructing messages that were made famous by Snapchat.Mr Spiegel addressed these claims in 2018, saying that the social media giant should also consider copying Snapchat\u0027s stance on user privacy.He said: We would really appreciate it if they copied our data protection practices also.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Meanwhile, employment far outstripped expectations, hitting an all-time high of 76.3 per cent.The news has thrown uncertainty into the works, as the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets the rates, is due to meet next week.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt had been widely expected to cut the interest rate, but the new data could give members pause for thought, experts said.“The continued resilience of the labour market increases the chances that the MPC will take a rain check next week, instead of cutting bank rate immediately,” said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.Created with Sketch.

With interest rates near to historical lows, there is little to be gained from further rate cuts.

Initial symptoms of the novel coronavirus are mainly fever, health officials said, with some experiencing coughing, tightness of the chest and shortness of breath. Scans on some patients have shown fluid in the lungs consistent with viral pneumonia.The World Health Organisation (WHO), which was first informed of the cluster of illness in Wuhan on 31 December, said the new disease was isolated for study on 7 January after other causes such as SARS, avian flu and MERS had been ruled out. It said it was closely following the current outbreak.Is it contagious?Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Others said they had cancelled their New Year travel plans.\u0026nbspState media praised the apparent evolution of the official response since the deadly SARS outbreak 17 years ago.“In the early days of SARS, reports were delayed and covered up,” said an editorial in the state-run Global Times. “That kind of thing must not happen again in China.”“We have made great strides in medicine, social affairs management and public opinion since 2003,” the editorial added.The WHO said it was reassured by the authorities’ response, and that it did not see the need for any further recommendations against travel to China at this time.And what about outside China?At least half a dozen countries in Asia and three US airports have started screening incoming airline passengers from central China.Videos posted online showed people in protective suits checking one by one the temperatures of plane passengers arriving in Macao, a Chinese special administrative region, from Wuhan. A man surnamed Yang who works for the Macao Health Bureau confirmed over the phone that such checks are indeed taking place in the southern Chinese region.Authorities in Thailand and Japan have already identified at least three cases, all involving recent travel from China. The WHO said contact-tracing efforts were under way and, in Japan, the government was coordinating across ministries to assess and contain the risk of outbreak.South Korea reported its first case on Monday, when a 35-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan tested positive for the new coronavirus one day after arriving at Seoul’s Incheon airport. The woman has been isolated at a state-run hospital in Incheon city, just west of Seoul, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The varied landscapes and lives of residents wedged in these borderlands speak of two different systems that have coexisted on one another’s doorstep.Far from the marches and salvos of tear gas and petrol bombs over the past half-year of anti-government protests that have convulsed Hong Kong, the residents in this border realm have borne witness to both rapid urbanisation, as China booms, and the preservation of a slower pace of life.About 20 miles\u0026nbsplong, this boundary meanders between fish ponds, farmland, sleepy traditional villages and grassy hills on the Hong Kong side, with the gleaming skyscrapers of China’s high-tech city of Shenzhen on the other. Shenzhen, once itself the bucolic backwater, has risen into China’s giddy vision of a digital, high-tech future.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHong Kong is world’s most visited city in 2019We may have won the elections battle, but the war is ongoingHong Kong police ‘hack into more than 3,700 mobile phones’Mr\u0026nbspLam, now in his eighties, lives in a house without mobile phone reception, where he farms and catches crabs. A narrow sliver of water separates him from mainland China. He recalls living in a wooden cabin along the Shenzhen River\u0026nbspwith his family 70 years ago. There were only “old and broken” sheds on the far shore back then, he says, gazing into the distance. “Of course, the mainland is much more advanced than before. Everything is good, even the streets are beautiful.”Over past decades of political upheaval in communist China, waves of mainlanders flooded across the border into Hong Kong, seeking peace and a better life. Lam still remembers the flashlights of the British-run police piercing the dark as they chased illegal immigrants making a dash for freedom.Andrew Kwok, an old fish farmer living in the area, recalls those who drowned making the perilous crossing. “There were a lot of them, hundreds of dead bodies in the river,” he says.The flickering, lonely torches have now been replaced by a vibrant mega-city with a million flashing lights. The living quality for people on both sides may have converged, but a gulf remains. For these two peoples, it remains a struggle to reconcile shifting eras, values and dreams.Merrin Ke, 23, grew up in Shenzhen but got her masters degree from Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University.

She says: “Hong Kong people used to come to have fun in Shenzhen and people from mainland China also liked to visit Hong Kong. But now such things are becoming less and less. I still hope everyone can put differences aside, and it’s not enough for just one side to do this. It requires the joint efforts of both sides.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The mysterious, so-called \u0027Lausanne\u0027 Sunflowers – the first Arles Sunflowers painting – with turquoise background. It was created in the summer of 1886 at Van Gogh\u0027s studio at Arles, north of Marseille in Provence. It has not been show to the public since 1948. 1889, oil on canvas. This painting depicts the view from the window of Van Gogh\u0027s asylum room of Saint-Remy-de-Provence. It is one of the most recognised paintings in the history of Western culture.1889, oil on canvas. The most recognised of several iris paintings made by Van Gogh at the Saint Paul-de-Mausole asylum, in the last year before his death in 1890. 1889, oil on canvas. Van Gogh painted over 43 self-portraits, paintings and drawings over a period of 10 years. He wrote to his sister: \u0027I am looking for a deeper likeness than that obtained by a photographer\u0027 and to his brother: \u0027People say, and I am willing to believe it, that it is hard to know yourself. But it is not easy to paint yourself either. The portraits painted by Rembrandt are more like a revelation.\u0027Oil on canvas, 1890. This painting was completed in early May, when Van Gogh was suffering a severe relapse of poor health – two months before his death. It is based on a pencil drawing, \u0027Worn Out\u0027, from a series of studies he made of a war veteran in 1882.620 Cafe Terrace at NightOil on canvas, 1888. This work was the first in a trilogy of paintings that featured starlit skies, completed over two years. Van Gogh was enthusiastic about the painting and wrote to his sister: \u0027Here you have a night picture without any black in it, done with nothing but beautiful blue and violet and green, and in these surroundings the lighted square acquires a pale sulphur and greenish citron-yellow colour. It amuses me enormously to paint the night right on the spot... I find satisfaction in painting things immediately.\u00271888, oil on canvas. The five customers in the scene have described as \u0027three drunks and derelicts in a large public room... huddled down in sleep or stupor.\u0027 Van Gogh told his brother that the cafe owner, Ginoux, had taken so much money it was time to take his revenge by painting the place.820 Bedroom in ArlesOil on canvas, 1888. Three authentic versions of this painting were made, easily discernible from the different paintings on the right wall. Oil on canvas, 1888. This painting is currently at the National Gallery in London. It was completed after Van Gogh moved from the Hotel Carrel to the Cafe de la Gare at Arles, south France. 1885, oil on canvas. Van Gogh chose this deliberately tricky composition to prove himself as a figure painter, wanting to show the way \u0027they have tilled the earth themselves with these hands they are putting in the dish... that they have thus honestly earned their food\u0027. 1120 Road with Cypress and Star1890, oil on canvas. Also known as Country Road, this was the last painting Van Gogh made in Saint Remy, It is part of the large Van Gogh collection at the Kroller-Muller Museum at Otterlo in the Netherlands.1220 Starry Night Over the Rhone1888, oil on canvas. Another of Van Gogh\u0027s paintings of Arles at nighttime – painted at a spot on the bank of the Rhone a few minutes walk from the Yellow House, which he was renting at the time. 1888, oil on canvas. In a short space of time during his first weeks at Arles, Van Gogh painted some fifteen orchards, hoping they would sell well because his subject, the glorious blossoms of the flowering trees, had the power to \u0027cheer everyone up\u0027. 1420 Self Portrait with a Grey Felt Hat1887, oil on canvas. This self portrait is slightly unusual because Van Gogh\u0027s face is angled to face straight towards the observer. Most of them depicted the face as it appeared in the mirror he used, so the right side seen in the image was actually the left side of his face. 1888 - 1890, oil on canvas. Van Gogh loved flowering trees, which to him symbolised hope and new life. This painting was created to celebrate the birth of his nephew and namesake, the son of his brother Theo and sister-in-law Jo.This was part of Van Gogh\u0027s preparation for The Potato Eaters, where he attempted to paint a figure against the light. He struggled, telling his brother Theo: \u0027It\u0027s a difficult effect\u0027, yet he succeeded in a strong contrast with the almost-black head of the woman and the use of white for the window, which focuses the gaze mainly on the woman\u0027s hands. 1720 Peasant Woman Against a Background of WheatOil on canvas, 1890. This painting, one of several versions by Van Gogh, has exchanged hands several times and was bought by Stephen Wynn in 1997 for $47.5 million. Seven years later, it was sold to American investor Steven A Cohen for more than $100 million. Oil on canvas, 1889. In the cypress trees of Saint Remy, Van Gogh found beauty as regards lines and proportions, like an Egyptian obelisk. He was enraptured but also challenged: \u0027It\u0027s the dark patch in a sun-drenched landscape, but it\u0027s one of the most interesting dark notes, the most difficult to hit off exactly that I can imagine\u0027. 1888, oil on canvas. Art historians believe this is the only Van Gogh painting he managed to sell during his lifetime, and has been listed among his major works. It was sold in Brussels for 400 francs (about £3,000) to Anna Boch, an impressionist painter and art collector from Belgium, who was the sister of Van Gogh\u0027s friend Eugene Boch. 2020 Wheatfield with Crows1890, oil on canvas.Commonly regarded as Van Gogh\u0027s final painting (with some doubt from art historians due to lack of historical records). Around 10 July Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo and wife Jo Bonger to say he had painted another three large canvases since visiting them in Paris the week before. Two of them, he said, expressed sadness and what he called \u0027extreme loneliness\u0027, but he also believed them to show the healthy and fortifying nature of the countryside. 1886, oil on canvas.

Instead of the more biologically accurate depiction of the lamb’s face with its eyes on either side of its head – as they would appear in real life – the newly restored lamb’s face is less life-like and more “humanoid”, as some art critics have put it, with the two eyes on the front of the face, more like a cat or a person. It also has a noticeably pinker nose and lips.Although the latest phase in the restoration was completed late in December last year, before and after photographs of the restored animal were posted to Twitter on Monday. A tweet by Fr A Schrenk (@frajds) has racked up more than 60,000 likes in\u0026nbsp24 hours.\u0026nbspThe sheep’s new face has now been compared to Zoolander’s “blue steel” pouting pose, the critically-panned Cats movie, the statue of footballer Christiano Ronaldo removed from Madeira airport, and even Mr Bean’s Whistler’s Mother\u0026nbspreimagining.\u0026nbspIt has also been likened to the amateur overpainting of a fresco of Jesus Christ at a church in the village of Borja, Spain, in 2012.Of course, this is par for the course on Twitter. The process behind the restoration is not really comparable to the horror which unfolded in Spain.\u0026nbspJournalists at Artnet\u0026nbspNews suggested the restored sheep had “yielded shocking revelations” including the animal’s “humanoid face”.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBelgium’s Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage, which is behind the restoration, is celebrating the work carried out by its team.\u0026nbspThe institute said the non-original overpainting was “introduced in the mid-16th century to adapt the painting to the fashion of the time\u0026nbspand to mask some local damage.”\u0026nbsp“The underlying original painting by the Van Eycks turned out to be extremely well preserved, with only around a five per cent loss of paint,” a statement said. “This was uncovered in its entirety, and the old damage was replenished by meticulous retouches.”The statement added: “There are no words to express the result. Liberated from the thick layers of yellow varnish and the coarser overpaints, we can discover the Van Eycks’ sublime virtuosity in abundance.”Hélène Dubois, the head of the restoration project,\u0026nbspquoted by The Art Newspaper in December last year, said: “This overpainting had been done so early on\u0026nbspand following the shapes of the original, with very similar pigments that had also aged in a similar way, that it was not actually visible on the technical documentation when the altarpiece first came in for treatment.“Nothing like this had ever been observed in early Netherlandish painting.”\u0026nbspShe said the discovery came as “a shock for everybody – for us, for the church, for all the scholars, for the international committee following this project.”Speaking to The Independent, art historian Dr Bendor Grosvenor said deciding to remove such old overpainting, done nearer to the time the painting was first completed than to now, could provoke debate among scholars.He said: “There’s always a debate as to whether a bit of repainting in a picture like that is something you should preserve as part of the painting’s historical journey, or whether it’s something that is an abomination – an affront to the original artist which should be removed.Old woman who botched \u0027Ecce Homo\u0027 Spanish fresco sells artwork for“In the case of the mystery sheep, if the overpaint had been put on 500 years ago then I think actually there’s quite a strong argument for leaving it on, not least because with modern technology you can now get a very good idea of what Van Eyck had intended beneath it. You could use digital infrared and all that stuff. It’s possible in a way to have your cake and eat it\u0026nbspwith a case like this.”“If the sheep had been added in 1974 by an inept restorer who thought they could improve on the handiwork of one of the world’s greatest artists, then I think they would say, ‘yeah, of course we should remove that, it was ridiculous to put it on in the first place’.”Koenraad Jonckheere, of Ghent University, said: “Conservation-restoration campaigns and the associated multidisciplinary research often raise important discoveries. The collaboration of conservators, chemists and art historians teaming up around objects allows for new insights into how a masterpiece was made, how it changed throughout history, and on the original intention of the artist.He said it appeared extensive layers of opaque overpaint had been applied in the middle of the 16th century.\u0026nbsp“The aim seems to have been to hide abrasions, local damage and old restorations, i.e. to make the altarpiece look as if it was perfectly preserved. This ‘renovation’ respected the original contours of the draperies and architecture although the original colors were slightly modified, the shapes simplified.”\u0026nbspHe added: “It was probably carried out by Lancelot Blondeel and Jan van Scorel who, according to the Ghent chronicler Marcus Van Vaernewyck, ‘came to Ghent and started to wash this painting, the year 1550, the 15th of September, with such love, so that they have cleansed this precious work in many places’.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She later supported fellow Manchester MP Andy Burnham in the  Labour leadership race - a contest eventually won by Jeremy Corbyn.Under Mr Corbyn, Ms Nandy initially stayed in the shadow cabinet as an energy spokeswoman, but in the wake of the EU referendum she became one of a large group of shadow cabinet ministers to resign in protest at his leadership.Explaining her decision she said Mr Corbyn was unable to form a broad, inclusive shadow cabinet that draws on the best of our movements left and right traditions.Emily Thornberry is one of Jeremy Corbyns closest parliamentary allies and is not running to replace him as the Labour leader.The shadow foreign secretary and MP for Islington South and Finsbury is a frequent critic of the Governments Brexit strategy and is married to a High Court judge.Her political career began in  when she was elected with a small majority of .She was ed as MP with an increased majority in  and was promptly promoted to the Shadow Cabinet.However she resigned from Ed Milibands team in  amid accusations of snobbery.The -year-old made ato the front bench in September  after Jeremy Corbyn appointed her shadow employment minister.One of Corbyns closest allies in Parliament, Thornberry has since covered foreign affairs and defence.On December , Thornberry became the first candidate to confirm they want to replace Jeremy Corbyn.Jess Phillips was in the running to become the next Labour leader but has now dropped out of the contest.The MP said in a statement she was dropping out because she cannot unite a party.She said: In order to do that, The Labour party will need to select a candidate who can unite all parts of our movement, the union movement, members and elected representatives.And I have to also be honest with myself, as I said I always would be throughout this campaign.At this time, that person is not me.In order to win the country, we are going to have to find a candidate, in this race, who can do all of that, and then take that message out to the country.A message of hope and change, that things can be better.Applications have opened for the public to become registered supporters of Labour and thereby eligible to vote in the party’s leadership elections.The -hour window for registering as a supporter closes on the th of January.The ballot will open on  February, with the next Labour leader set to come into office by March.Jeremy Corbyn said he would stay in place while the party decides who will take the crown.There is no deputy leader to fill the position after Tom Watson stood down as MP earlier this year.The stakes are high for the party after Corbyns failure to secure dozens of safe seats across the country and the alienation and disillusionment of many voters.A new leader will aim to claw back Labours losses following the  December election.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She should have asked herselfshe was willing and able to behave in accordance with the expectations.Her Majesty’s words show great diplomacy but Meghan’s behaviour has so far not been diplomatic. A diplomat wouldn’t fall out with her own family.Her friends leaked negative comments about the “toxic” Royal Family. She also allowed damage to be done against our family via friends and PR advisers.She watched the media taunt and torture my dad, never springing to his defence like a true humanitarian would.Thomas was an incredible dad. He paid every penny of her education and cared greatly for her.He is now frail, with a heart condition. He doesn’t have a PR team to spin him a good story.The Queen, at , shouldn’t have had to face the stress of seeing her family torn apart.Meghan hasn’t stepped forward to minimise the damage.She knows how Harry leaving has affected them, but she hasn’t spoken up in their defence.Yet in her statement, the Queen says she is “particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family”.Her Majesty is building bridges there. It would be goodMeghan could do the same.She could have expressed her thanks for the kindness of the Queen and Prince Charles.She could have expressed gratitude to her own father or her first husband, Trevor, who gave her career opportunities.My sister has become a totally dferent person, choosing wealth and fortune over family.Her decision to leave is nothing to do with the behaviour of the royals, or race.Her marriage to Prince Harry was so symbolic of ethnic unity.The preacher and choir were all of African heritage. It was a lovely joining together.The royals embraced that. They welcomed Meghan into their lives, into the culture, and allowed her to promote people of all races. I have never heard anything racist coming out of the Windsors about my sister.Supporters who claim a racist element forced Meghan out are frustrated their hoped-for fairytale princess didn’t work out.These social equality-obsessed people had pinned their hopes on Meghan. They hoped for an equality of race right at the higher echelons of society.At least Harry and Meghan were right to decide tothe £.million they received to renovate Frogmore Cottage and not take any more public funds.In the Queen’s statement, she hopes Meghan and Harry can “start building a happy and peaceful le”. We have to hope for the sake of my sister and for the Royal Family that this agreement achieves that aim.My fear is Meghan’s decision isn’t about moving to Canada for a quiet le as a young mother.Nothing about their actions so far suggest they truly desire a private le out the limelight.They have paraded themselves on the red carpet, tried to make deals with Disney, and become pals with the Clooneys and other A-list stars.Smooching up to Vogue magazine, to fashion and to the film industry is not consistent with taking a step back.Their objective is fame and fortune — to be Hollywood.Meghan’s goals are not consistent with those of the Royal Family. Personally, I don’t believe she ever expected to fit in with the strict structures and traditions of the Windsor household.Even after marrying she kept her lawyer and publicity adviser, suggesting she wasn’t willing to sever her ties with her old le.Perhaps she always had the idea toto her le as an actress and lestyle influencer.In the statement from Buckingham Palace, it says “the Sussexes have made clear everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty”.My concern is that this is a face-saving statement, which won’t work in reality. The Royal Family has always been opposed to merchandising and corporate endeavours outside of them.If Meghan and Harry want to honour the Queen, they will consult her before doing deals.She thinks she can be at the top of the world, but using the royals to get that international notoriety is tacky.Meghan was a cable TV actress before marrying Harry and would not be on the front of every newspaper and magazine without him.In the US, the Press is still positive, praising her attempts to modernise the British monarchy and saying how cool she is.The media in Calornia and New York are likely to remain in her corner but I don’t think Meghan and Harry will ever be able to overshadow Prince William and his we Catherine.They are exemplary they are iconic. There is no comparison.It is clear Meghan cares for Archie, but I do worry about his future. There doesn’t seem to have been a lot of consideration given to his cousins George, Charlotte and Louis and how often he will see them. Harry has put Meghan above his brother, father and grandmother. A house ided cannot stand.I am worried that Meghan and Harry will never find true ­happiness. They could not find contentment with the Royal Family, will they be able to find it away from them Maybe they will meet up with counsellors who can help them to heal the wounds.Perhaps they will make amends by apologising.We need sincerity and dignity from Meghan in order to find peace. Then, perhaps, she will have the peace she needs to go forward.I loved my sister, but I do not like the person she has become.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We like — we love — our Queen here in Britain.But we are not prepared to pay the way for her multi-millionaire grandson — £million inheritance from his mum and £million from the Queen Mum —he no longer wishes to be a full-time royal.There is no royal halfway house — no one foot in, one foot out — as Her Majesty has rightly agreed.So yes, we want back the £.million we spent on the renovations of a “cottage” which he will seldom live in. So far, so good.But there are problems with this deal, some of which may well come back to bite Buckingham ­Palace and its push for a “hard Megxit”.Harry, a -year-old married father, is still taking money from his dad’s Duchy of Cornwall estate, despite his stated desire to live a financially independent le. This turbo-charged pocket money amounts to over £million a year at present.Traditionally, the sons of the heirs to the throne rely on the Duchy to fund their lives while they go about their royal duties, but without those duties Harry no longer needs to rely on the Bank of Dad.If the Prince of Wales chooses to fund his son and Meghan, it is his choice. But he will only do it in an attempt to maintain some necessary control over their expenditure. This is problematic for free-spirited Harry — and Charles, who will almost certainly not approve of everything this money is spent on.Sure, Harry and Meghan can make millions of dollars by lending their names to commercial ventures. But the Buckingham Palace statement says: “The Sussexes have made clear everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty.” What an alarmingly vague and woolly line.We can take a stab at what these values are — ask any good Christian. But how do they relate to commercial deals with huge American corporations For example, Harry has been touting Meghan for voiceover work with Disney.But which characters are brand-safe  Presumably Cruella de Vil is off limits And what about interviews  A big- money sit-down with a US network — their pal Oprah Winfrey would surely be first in line — would net a huge fee. But what can they say and still uphold the Queen’s values The world is interested in Meghan and Harry’s touchy-feely philanthropic endeavours, but what they really want is the juice. What’s it really like in the Royal Family  How they approach this is crucial.Arguably, they should never discuss the “family” on TV — the Queen does not. If they write books, it should not be about their personal experiences within the “family”. And any products from their brand should be unrelated to the Royal Family.If their money-making ventures are focused on the charities they support, they will be fine. Their new foundation could make them millions but while doing so make millions for their charities, too. This is how they could get away with it. But will this be enough for the ambitious Meghan  I somehow doubt it.However nice Her Majesty appears to be, she has given up her le and much of her personal happiness to do her duty and it is a new world for her to see her grandson no longer feels capable of doing the same — albeit in a much smaller way — himself.While incredibly astute, the deal is not what the Queen wanted. She would have preferred to keep them within the royal fold, but she does not want another Diana disaster. Diana knew the system was not hers to change, and it is not Harry and Meghan’s either. It belongs to the Queen.She tried to accommodate Diana within it. What the Queen could not do was to restructure the monarchy to suit her daughter-in-law. As she now can’t reconstruct the monarchy for her grandson and his we. So, she has asked them to step away.The last thing the Queen wanted was for it to look asthe Duke and Duchess of Sussex had been thrown out of the royal fold. Archie Mountbatten Windsor is her and Prince Philip’s eighth great-grandchild. His future is important to them as it might also embody a small part of the future of a modern monarchy. But how much of a royal this soon-to-be largely Canadian-bred lad will ever be remains to be seen. Not much, is the best bet.The Sussexes have what they want. They don’t want to be criticised for taking monies from the British taxpayer. They don’t want to be seen as taking advantage of the Queen’s kindness. And whatever other members of the Royal Family might think of them, and be disappointed by them, Harry is the son of the future King.So Her Majesty has accommodated them. It is now up to them to show their loyalty to her.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He warned the Left’s obsession is providing a cloak for crime.The Sussexes’ decision to quit was “not racism”, he told a cheering crowd. “We’re the most tolerant, lovely country in Europe.”Signicantly, the applause came not from the far Right but from right-on BBC Question Time — an audience carefully chosen, stressed presenter Fiona Bruce, to reflect Britain by age, sex and politics.Fox — famous as DS James Hathaway in TV’s Lewis — was instantly denounced as a “privileged white male” and therefore with no right to an opinion.“Oh, God!” he cried. “I can’t help what I am, I was born like this. It’s an immutable characteristic, so to call me a white privileged male is to be racist.”His landmark moment went viral.Ricky Gervais spoke for the silent majority when he told the Golden Globes nominees “who know nothing about the real world” to tear up their political speeches.But it took the furore over Megxit — and Fox’s unanswerable case for the defence — to trigger Britain’s own fightback.Fox has given a voice to ordinary, decent citizens who are incensed by finger-wagging know-alls smearing them as racists, Nazis and fascists.These ugly insults were hurled at millions who backed Brexit and the overwhelming majority who voted for Boris Johnson.Until now we’ve been too polite to fight back, gagged by Thought Police who bark: “You can’t say that.”So we put up with politically correct sniping from such “identity” obsessives as rapper Stormzy, MP Clive Lewis and the entire Labour Party, who smell racism under every rock.Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan sparked uproar when he challenged black and Asian commentators to produce a “shred of evidence” of Press racism. They failed.Fox’s one-man mission is more than a poke at the PC brigade. It is about free speech — and hypocrisy.Scattergun charges of racism offer an alibi to serious crime, he says, citing the Pakistani sex gangs who systematically raped and trafficked white victims across Britain — with police blessing.“It’s one of the dangerous things about throwing racism around,” the actor told Question Time.“People become so conscious of it that things like the Manchester grooming scandal get ignored.”He spoke as police finally confessed to deliberately turning a blind eye to decades-long vile abuse of vulnerable, underage white girls.A police report confirms a -year reign of sex abuse went unchecked after an unnamed chief inspector ruled: “With it being Asians, we can’t afford for this to be coming out.”Fear of the race card also partly explains why police failed to halt the slaughter of mostly black victims by mostly black kne gangs.The same “cultural cringe” stops prison staff tackling dangerous Islamist gangs who have seized control in Britain’s terror jails.It’s why forced marriage and honour killings go unchecked.Now, at last, black and Asian voices are bravely confronting the race zealots.Leading commentator and ex-Equality Commissioner Trevor Phillips, son of poor immigrants, condemns “feel- good” racism detectorists.“It might make ‘right-on’ white liberals feel better,” he says. “But the price of their smugness is an ongoing bloody massacre of black children.”Home Secretary Priti Patel, daughter of Uganda-Indian migrants, has declared war on the race industry.The BBC strenuously denies “institutional bias”, despite abundant evidence from within the Beeb itself – including from former Director-General Mark Thompson.Now Boris Johnson is in power and the bloated corporation’s £BILLION subsidy is at risk.Perhaps that’s why Question Time is now apparently balanced, Andrew Marr is being polite to Tory guests and on Radio ’s Today, Nick Robinson has gone almost silent.“We live in a great country, a land of opportunity for all,” she said. “Institutionalised, corrosive behaviour that disregards victims has to end.“Tackling this abuse is a priority for the Home Office. There will be no no-go areas.”At last, perhaps, we have a senior politician of colour who is prepared to follow Laurence Fox’s advice and “speak truth to nonsense”.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No Sussex titles to trademark. And no funding of their police guards.If those terms of abdication are proposed and accepted, then we, along with most reasonable British people, will wish Harry and Meghan Wales every happiness in beginning their new lives.A PEERAGE for any one of John Bercow, Karie Murphy or Tom Watson — let alone all three — would be a grotesque insult to the British people.Brexit-blocking former Speaker Bercow stands accused of bullying Commons staff.Murphy, Jeremy Corbyn’s bag-carrier, is being investigated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission for allowing anti-Semitism to fester in the Labour Party.And Jezza’s slippery ex-deputy Watson egged on the bungled VIP paedo ring investigation that ruined innocent people’s lives — and cost the taxpayer upwards of £million.The Lords was meant to be a crucial chamber where the wisest in the land could check and amend legislation.But it has mortally damaged its reputation by spending three years trying to thwart Brexit, the biggest democratic mandate in our history.If it now adds any of this trio of scandal-drenched Corbyn nominees to its already bloated ranks, then frankly, it is done for.Boris Johnson is said to be considering moving the House of Lords up to York.If Bercow, Murphy or Watson are to be anywhere near it, we’d rather relocate it to outer Siberia. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On the contrary, it is an abdication that has sadly plunged him into turmoil.He is a man pulled in opposite directions, torn between patriotic duty and his deep love for his we, between his loyalty to the monarchy and his desire for a new, less constrained role.That explains why, throughout the recent crisis that he and Meghan inflicted on the House of Windsor, his stance has been so confused and contradictory.He speaks of his devotion to Britain but seeks a fresh start in Canada.He expresses his desire to serve but gives up the commitments that go with his position.He trumpets his yearning for privacy, yet he and his we appear keen to set themselves up as a millionaire celebrity couple - hardly the way to avoid attention.He continually wails about media intrusion, yet he resigns as Captain-General of the Royal Marines so he can spend more time on his social media accounts.He and the Duchess endlessly talk about their need for emotional support, yet they have shown little concern for the needs of their own families.Those inconsistencies were graphically exposed in the speech he made on Sunday night at a charity dinner in London to try and justy his recent conduct.His address was given in the immediate aftermath of the deal reached at Sandringham, where he and Meghan agreed to the loss of public funding and the use of their titles infor their independence.It was clear that the saga had exacted a heavy toll on him. In a voice often cracking with emotion, he told his audience that they would “hear the truth from me”.But what they actually heard was a catalogue of embittered anguish.As often, he moaned about the press, which he painted as a sinister, powerful force which needs to be curtailed.Unfortunately, despite all his professed love of Britain, Harry appears to have no understanding that a free, open media is essential to our democracy.He has proved unable to handle any criticism at all – even when it is justied, as in the hypocrisy of his green campaigning while indulging in the use of private jets.It is ashe thinks the media should be filled with fawning sycophants who never scrutinise but just lavish him with praise.That is the kind of regime that belongs to a totalitarian dictatorship, not traditionally liberal Britain.Much of Harry’s hostility to journalists stems from their relationship with his mother. But, however understandable, this is another myth.Princess Diana was not naïve when it came to the press. She was a shrewd, sometimes ruthless operator, who was quite willing to exploit the newspapers when it suited her.With some indignation, he complained that the Sandringham deal was not what he wanted. But it was foolish of him to believe that he and Meghan could have semi-detached Royal status, enjoying its privileges without its obligations.The Queen could never have tolerated that, especially because any commercial deals reached by the Sussexes could have badly compromised her family, just as their cherished fashionable causes could have undermined the Crown.Royalty cannot be a vehicle for self-enrichment or political posturing.The Duke’s inner agony was at its most obvious when he spoke of his regrets for the le he is leaving.Having revealed that he and Meghan were excited to “fly the flag and carry out our roles for this country with pride”, he referred to his “great sadness” at the step they have taken.Yet he claimed that they had “really no other option”. It was another moment of self-deceit, for there were certainly other courses open to them.They could have either stuck to their Royal positions without creating such a psycho drama about themselves, or,they really wanted freedom without scrutiny, they could have retired to live quietly as ordinary citizens, as some other members of the Royal family have done in the past.But such modesty would not have fulfilled their ambitions to be globe-trotting celebrities.It is this craving for fame that highlights the emptiness of Harry’s language about his devotion to service. “I will continue to be the same man who holds his country dear and dedicates his le to supporting the causes, charities and military communities so important to me,” he declared at the charity dinner.Yet this is the same man who was revealed to have touted his we’s voiceover skills to Disney bosses at the London premiere of the Lion King last summer.In the eyes of their critics, the real dedication that Harry and Meghan will probably soon show is to TV deals, book advances, and brand partnerships.In a further attempt to justy their actions, Harry implied that they had been suffering for a long time through the crushing restrictions of Royal le.The final move had been made, he explained, “after so many months of talks and so many years of challenges.”He and Meghan have only been married for  months. A true model of stoical determination, the Queen has been on the throne for almost  years without any public complaint.That just illustrates Harry’s lack of perspective. Insulated by privilege, he has little understanding of the lives of ordinary British citizens, many of whom have endured far greater struggles than anything he has ever experienced.After the Queen had been so publicly generous about him and Meghan in her statement from Sandringham at the weekend, saying that “they will always be much loved members of my family,” it was bad manners of Harry to complain about the deal he had just accepted.He should have responded to his grandmother’s generosity in the same spirit.But what’s done is done. Our monarchy has survived its latest crisis. The moment for recriminations has passed now that a new chapter is about to begin.As he settles in Canada, Prince Harry is bound to miss aspects of his old le in Britain, which even now he describes as “my home and the place I love.And the British public will miss him. At his best, he brought a lovable humour, spontaneity and lack of convention to the Royal Family.We can only hope that now, after taking this drastic decision, he finds the peace that he and Meghan crave.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Which makes Hall’s defence of the licence fee even more ridiculous.In an era of multiple-choice subscription TV it is absurd for one broadcaster to be funded by a tax enforceable by criminal penalty.It is even more laughable to claim it “ensures independence­ . . . obliges us to serve everyone and reflect every part of the UK”.Hall’s BBC spent his entire tenure turning a deaf ear to half the UK. Hence its shock at last month’s Tory triumph.Hall’s decision to rob over-s of the free licences he agreed to in  was equally outrageous.The idea that the £million cost will harm vital BBC services, when so much of its content amounts to needless competition with commercial rivals, is fatally flawed.His successor must run a smaller Beeb, more in touch with the public, less in the grip of suffocating “wokeness”, focused not on gratuitous expansion but the high-quality shows it does best.This new chief should accept that non-payment of the licence must be decriminalised and the levy finally replaced with a voluntary subscription.Only then will the BBC join the st Century.THE problem with Harry saying he and Meghan had no option but to move abroad to avoid our “powerful media” is that not a word of it is true.It is sheer paranoia to say the Press has done anything but legitimately scrutinise a publicly-funded couple.And the reality is they do not want to avoid media. They want to avoid criticism.Indeed they crave media attentionit meekly writes their PR puff pieces. Corbyn’s Labour is the same.As for having no choice, what drivel.They could have grown up, developed a thicker skin and done their royal duty as they first promised.To pretend that dark forces made them seek a vast fortune as A-list celebs in the LA sunshine is self-serving cobblers.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Person to person transmission has been confirmed and, as expected, we are seeing rapidly increasing case numbers across China, and in more countries, with health care workers infected.He praised the speed at which the virus has been identied, and the strong global coordination from the WHO, but warned more is to come from this outbreak.With travel being a huge part of the fast approaching Chinese New Year, it is right that concern levels are at the highest level, he added.A major concern is the range of symptoms this virus is causing.It is clear some people are being affected and are infectious while experiencing only very mild symptoms at or possibly no symptoms at all .This may be masking the true numbers infected and the extent of person to person transmission. It is a matter of urgency to work this out.Speaking on LBC today, leading virologist Professor John Oxford, from Queen Mary College, said he was quaking in my shoes at the potential for spread over the holidays.He said: None of us have faced a new virus with so many people in a community travelling around.Thats whats going to happen in China at the end of the week.Once they are close together in taxis or small rooms, then there may be a problem.The only way to stop it is physical cleaning and social distance - keeping away from people.The WHO announced it will hold an Emergency Committee meeting in Geneva tomorrow, to determinethe outbreak should be classed as a global crisis.While Chinese authorities have confirmed more than  cases, another  people are suspected ill with the new strain and around , more are under observation.Fteen healthcare professionals are among those infected.However, experts at Imperial College London predict the true number of cases could be far greater - with estimates closer to ,.WHOs regional director for the western Pacic, Takeshi Kasai, said: Information about newly reported infections suggest there may now be sustained human-to-human transmission.The mayor of Wuhan confirmed the latest deaths today, an -year-old man from the city, which is home to more than  million people.A -year-old man, known only as Li, and a woman, , known as Yin were also confirmed to have died from multiple organ failure.In Taiwan today, an epidemic response command centre has been set up with more than , beds prepared in isolation wards in case the virus spreads further.There, health officials confirmed a woman, thought to be in her s, had caught the new strain.She is currently in hospital and receiving treatment, according to local media reports.So far, the WHO has not advised travel or trade restrictions but could put such measures in place at tomorrows emergency meeting.WHO chiefs are set to considerthis outbreak should be declared a global emergency like the  Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the current outbreak in Congo and the Zika outbreak in Central America in .While NHS chiefs have urged doctors in the UK to be alert to signs of the killer virus, they said today the threat to Brits is low.The origin of the virus is not get known, but experts say the most likely source is an animal.Chinese officials have linked the outbreak last month to a seafood market in the city of Wuhan - where more than  cases have been confirmed.The new strain belongs to a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndromeand Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome .The common early signs of infection include fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing dficulties, according to WHO.In more severe cases, it can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.In Australia, border forces have been ordered to ensure all sick passengers are assessed by a trained Biosecurity officer on arrival.Chief health officer Brendan Murphy said the risk was low but added the three daily flights from Wuhan will be met by medics in response to the rapidly emerging situation.State health officials in New South Wales are distributing pamphlets in English and Chinese to all passengers arriving from Wuhan describing the symptoms.The crackdown comes as it was revealed the virus was feared to have reached Australia after a man was tested for the killer mystery bug.The man, from Brisbane, was displaying symptoms of the fatal coronavirus after ing from a family holiday and has been placed in quarantine.The US has also started screening passengers on flights from Wuhan arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport, San Francisco International Airport and Los Angeles International airport.Other international airports are also screening passengers for the mysterious SARS-like disease after it was revealed it had jumped China’s borders.A video has been shared widely on Twitter showing people on a domestic flight out of the central Chinese city of Wuhan having their temperature taken one-by-one by people in protective suits.A Brit on holiday in Thailand is feared to be the first western victim of the illness.Ash Shorley, , was rushed to hospital after the bug infected both lungs while he was on Koh Phi Phi island in Thailand.The outbreak has caused alarm because of its connection to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome , which killed nearly  people across mainland China and Hong Kong in -.The virus attacks the respiratory system, causing lung lesions.Symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever, shortness of breath, chills and body aches.It is incredibly contagious and is spread through contact with anything the virus is on as well as infected breath, coughs or sneezes.Symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever, shortness of breath, chills and body aches.In most cases, you wont know whether you have a coronavirus or a dferent cold-causing virus, such as rhinovirus.Buta coronavirus infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract , it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with heart disease or people with weakened immune systems.There is no vaccine for coronavirus.In  an outbreak of a similar virus, SARS, infected more than , people in  countries before it was brought under control, killing  of those worldwide.Coronaviruses cause diseases ranging from the common cold to more severe ones such as SARS.The Chinese government initially tried to conceal the severity of that epidemic but its cover-up was exposed by a high-ranking physician.Initial symptoms of the novel coronavirus include fever, cough, tightness of the chest and shortness of breath, and those seriously ill developed pneumonia.At least half a dozen Asian countries and three US airports have started screening incoming airline passengers from central China.Chinese President Xi Jinping said it was “extremely crucial” to take every possible measure to combat the disease that has infected at least  people in the country.He said: The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan and other places must be taken seriously“Party committees, governments and relevant departments at all levels should put people’s lives and health first.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s why I have been campaigning for a statue to be erected in his honour.But shockingly, I’ve faced strong opposition to a Merrick memorial. I’ve had abuse over social media, with cruel protesters mocking his disability by saying: “Leicester’s ugly enough.”I’ve even been called a “vampire showman” — a reference to freak show bosses who people mistakenly believe made his le a misery.Behind this stereotype, the true story of the Elephant Man is a tale of empowerment and inspiration. He was nothing like the film suggests, but rather an independent disabled man who was ahead of his time.In , aged  and impoverished, he checked himself into the Leicester workhouse, a dire institution where the destitute were given food, shelter and work.Despite his disability, for four years Merrick would have probably been put to work grinding stone or crushing bones.He was faced with a decision — whether to stay there and die or go out and live his le. He decided he would try to make his name and fortune by appearing in a novelty show.Victorians loved the weird and dferent and would pay to see a bearded lady or a tattooed man at one of these shows. But importantly, it was a way for people who were dferent to earn good money and avoid the workhouse.So Merrick wrote to music hall manager Sam Torr, asking him to be his agent, just like in the  film The Greatest Showman.Torr then arranged Merrick’s release from the workhouse and he was soon touring around clubs in the East Midlands.Then when he ran out of local audiences he moved to London, where he met his next agent, Tom Norman — a distant cousin of mine.They set up the Elephant Man show on Whitechapel Road, and for the two weeks they worked together and were more like business partners than owner and slave.In the  film, Tom Norman is portrayed as Mr Bytes, an old drunk who beats Merrick. Norman was actually young, and a member of the Temperance movement, which campaigned against drunkenness, so certainly not a boozy old man.For a fee, Norman would tell crowds a myth of how, at his birth, Merrick’s mother was stamped on by an elephant, resulting in a half-man, half- elephant creature.He would pull back a curtain to reveal Merrick, leaving audiences gawping in amazement. Enterprising Merrick wrote a short pamplet of his le story, which was sold at the show, and he would keep these earnings for himself.In the film we see Merrick’s mother Mary Jane screaming in terror while being trampled by elephants. But according to Merrick himself, his disability did not begin to show until he was five.He lived a normal childhood, going to school and learning to read and write. Mary Jane, a Sunday school teacher, died from unknown causes when he was just , and his father — also Joseph — soon remarried.By then young Joseph was keen to go out and start earning a living. He initially worked in a cigar factory before getting a peddler’s licence to hawk bobbins and gloves around Leicester.He later saidhe didn’t make enough money, his father and stepmother would not feed him. While this sounds like child abuse to us, the Victorians firmly believed in “spare the rod and spoil the child” so this would have been seen as normal.The cause of Merrick’s disability is still open to debate but the most popular diagnosis is proteus syndrome, a rare condition characterised by overgrowth of the bones and skin.A doctor has even suggested that his condition is unique — and should be named Merrick’s syndrome after its lone sufferer.It is impossible to test Merrick’s DNA to identy the illness, as when he died, his flesh was stripped from his bones, which were bleached twice, while hairs taken from his clothes have failed to produce any DNA results.In his day he was a medical curiosity and doctors did try to study him. A surgeon, Frederick Treves, sought out Merrick and asked him to come to the London Hospital to be studied by doctors.At first Merrick agreed, yet after three or four visits he refused to go back, saying he felt like he was in a cattle market.Treves was furious and a week later police shut down Merrick and Norman’s show as a public nuisance. Whether Treves had a hand in it is impossible to say.Undeterred and wealthy from his show with Norman, Merrick then spent three months with a travelling circus in Northamptonshire.While travelling, he began to wear a hood and cape so he could walk the streets without getting jeered or followed. His real ambition was to entertain audiences in Europe, so he advertised in the papers for a new manager who could take him to the Continent.Details of what happened abroad are vague but Merrick seems to have been robbed and abandoned by his new management, leaving him in Brussels without a penny to his name.He somehow travelled back to London, where he found Dr Treves, who agreed to let him stay at the London Hospital.His care would be funded by wealthy benefactors — but there would have been an expectation that Merrick would let doctors examine him.One, Dr Wilfred Granville, wrote in his memoirs that Merrick would look at specimens in the hospital and ponder what his body parts would look like in a bottle. It was clear he knew his fate.But there is no reason to believe Merrick was unhappy in the hospital, in fact he seems to have enjoyed himself.While the Queen’s great-grandmother Princess Alexandra was opening a nurses’ wing in the hospital, she visited Merrick and shook his hand.They became firm friends and she would often visit and write him letters. In turn, Merrick made her a cardboard model of a German cathedral. Her husband Prince Edward, the future King, even sent food and drink packages to Merrick.As a result of this friendship it became fashionable for the upper classes to visit Merrick and give him signed pictures and trinkets.Aristocrat Lady Louisa Knightley invited him to holiday at the grand Fawsley Hall in Northamptonshire, where he stayed three times, enjoying walking freely in the estate’s grounds without fear of being ridiculed.But he never forgot Tom Norman. A porter once overheard Merrick asking when he could visit his old friend. But when Tom visited the hospital he was refused entry and the pair never saw each other again.Many people believe Merrick died by taking his own le. He was unable to sleep on his back as the sheer weight of his head could dislocate his neck, so instead he was forced to sleep with his head against his knees.In the film a desperate Merrick — played by Oscar-nominated John Hurt — is shown removing the cushions which helped him to sit up straight while sleeping, insinuating that he killed himself.But while he did die tragically young at , the evidence points to his death being accidental. He was found in the afternoon — not at night — lying across his bed ashe had slipped and was trying to get up.His inquest found he had died from a dislocated neck but we can’t trust the science of the time. Merrick’s death could have been caused by a stroke or seizure, but it is a mystery we will never solve.While his skeleton is kept at the Royal London Hospital, last May I found the unmarked grave of some of his flesh in the City of London Cemetery and Crematorium in Ilford.It made worldwide news and I was astounded by the reaction to my discovery. So many people were interested in his story.This is what led me to my quest to get Merrick recognised for the great man he was, with a statue in Leicester city centre.I want people to take off their blinkers, see what he really did with his le and realise he was not just the freak show casualty who was portrayed in the Elephant Man film.And to those who complain his statue would be “ugly” — take a lesson from Merrick’s le to see what’s on the inside, not just the outside.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You have to be creative and aggressive and think two steps ahead of the celebrity.”And therein lies the rub. Largely stripped of his royal status, Harry is now a common-or-garden celebrity who has to take his chances with the rest of them in the jungle of hustling for work amid bustling premiere crowds.Then there’s news website TMZ and its myriad wannabe imitations. They’ll be dogging his every move with a video camera, hoping to catch a magical clickbait moment.Its website — together with a frenzied voiceover — is already jokingthat Meghan might sign up for The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.As a former actress on cable show Suits,Meghan was of little interest to the Hollywood glitterati and the parasites that feed off them.But now  She’s gold-dust — particularly as her inner circle includes A-listers such as the Clooneys, Serena Williams, Oprah and the Obamas. And therein lies yet another rub. If you attend premieres of movies you’re not in, holiday on rich people’s jets and yachts and hang out at members-only clubs where the hoi polloi are only allowed in to clean up after you . . . then you are wilfully choosing a “celebrity le” and, with that, comes media attention, particularly from the Wild West of online.They need you for clickbait, and you need them to maintain the “popularity” upon which you trade and, without which, you are nothing .Unless, of course, you have a God- given talent like Meryl Streep, Judi Dench, Gary Oldman, Benedict Cumberbatch etc, etc — all of whom put on a suit frock when they have a film to promote but otherwise live a perfectly normal, unremarkable and, therefore, largely “peaceful le” unbothered by the media.Or a member of the British Royal Family who can retreat to one of their many estates for a spot of fishing and contemplation.So . . . “a more peaceful le” outside the protective environs of the monarchy  Dream on.But then, deep down, one suspects that Harry and Meghan both know that and are simply using it as a smokescreen for the real story.His we was homesick, found royal duties restrictive and dull and wanted toto her old le with royal knobs on.And because Harry loves her: “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.”Good luck to them. Genuinely. But let’s not pretend they had no other option because of something this country did or didn’t do.HARRY and Meghan might be forced to ditch their proposed Sussex Royal brandThe Queen sees it as cashing in on their former royal status.As they’ve already registered it for everything from magazines to mugs, dropping it altogether could prove expensive.So perhaps a little tweak — to  Sussex Royle — might be an easy and appropriate compromise As the incomparable Jim Royle, aka Ricky Tomlinson, might say: “Have their cake and eat it  . .

This year,  artists that were not selected by the membership were added to the possible nomination list.The filing goes on to claim that in some cases, an eligible artist will even be on the committee that is selecting their category.As a result, one artist who initially ranked  out of  in the  Song of the Year category ended up with a nomination. This artist was actually permitted to sit on the Song of the Year nomination committee, reads the filing.Incredibly, this artist is also represented by a member of the Board.Deborah does not name that nominee, but she does identy two of the artists who were impacted by this move.As a result of the foregoing, it is not surprising that many high caliber artists who could have taken home the award in a specic category, have, at times, not been nominated at all, states the complaint.For instance, Ed Sheeran and Ariana Grande, who had been voted for by the membership, missed out on nominations in the  Song of the Year category in part because the aforementioned artist who ranked  out of  was nominated instead.Ariana seemed to be responding to this on Tuesday evening when she tweeted: u seen it.This happened in other categories too claims Deborah, who cites one other example in her filing.Similarly, in the “secret committee” for Best Jazz Vocals, artists that were up for an award in that category also participated in the nomination voting process, says the filing.Ms. Dugan actually learned about this from a Grammy Award winning artist who was also a committee member , who complained about improprieties and conflicts of interest within the nomination process.In other instances, Deborah claims that the committees just pick who they personally want to see on the show.The purpose of the nomination review committees is, ostensibly, to narrow the  potential nominationsdown to the five to eightmost deserving artists prior to resubmitting the final list to the voting members of the Academy, explains Deborah.However, the Board uses these committees as an opportunity to push forward artists with whom they have relationships. Indeed, it is not unusual for artists who have relationships with Board members and who ranked at the bottom of the initial -artist list to end up receiving nominations.It goes on to claim: The Board also manipulates the nominations process to ensure that certain songs or albums are nominated when the producer of the Grammyswants a particular song performed during the show.Dugan was put on leave last week following an allegation of misconduct by a senior leader at the organization.The Recording Academy then announced that Dugan had been “abusive” and created a “toxic and intolerable” work environment, an accusation that Dugan dismissed through her attorney.She is now seeking  million from the not-for profit organization.The Academy meanwhile said in response to the filing: Our loyalty will always be to the , members of the Recording Academy. We regret that music’s biggest night is being stolen from them by Ms. Dugan’s actions, and we are working to resolve the matter as quickly as possible.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and death. There are no specic treatments for the new coronavirus but symptoms can be relieved.WHAT is being done to stop it spreading  Numerous nations have adopted screening measures for travellers arriving from China. And the World Health Organisation is holding an emergency meeting today in Geneva to decide whether the outbreak “constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, and what recommendations should be made to manage it”. It is urging people to take measures such as regular hand washing, avoiding close contact with anyone coughing and sneezing, and thoroughly cooking meat and eggs.Dr Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said a team of scientists in Texas, New York and China, are also working on a vaccine.He told the broadcaster: The lesson weve learned is coronavirus infections are serious and one of the newest and biggest global health threats.Dr Hotez added that its less challenging to develop a vaccine for coronaviruses than for other viruses, including HIV or flu.He said: Every virus has its challenges, but coronaviruses can be a relatively straightforward vaccine target.According to the South China Morning Post, Bejing warned that anyone who withheld information would face severe punishment and be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity.A spokesperson said: Anyone who puts the face of politicians before the interests of the people will be the sinner of a millennium to the party and the people.Anyone who deliberately delays and hides the reporting of [virus] cases out of his or her own self-interest will be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Former Chief of the Defence Staff, Admiral Lord Boyce, and ex-head of the Navy, Lord West, delivered scathing verdicts on the Senior Service during a House of Lords debate. The UK has just six destroyers and  frigates - with more than a third stuck in dock at any one time. The former naval top brass issued the latest warnings about the Type , Daring-class destroyers, which cost £billion each and have been plagued by engine trouble.  They also voiced fears about the rate at which ageing Type , Duke-class frigates are being replaced by Type , City-class global combat ships. Speaking at Westminster, Lord Boyce said: “Our number of frigates and destroyers are anorexic, and this has been exacerbated by the Type  problem. “We embarked upon an eight-ship, Type  frigate building programme in , but the first ship, Glasgow, won’t be commissioned until . “Thereafter, a ship appears after every two years.”  The timetable was “completely unacceptable and is a black mark against the Government and our shipbuilding industry”, he stormed. Pressing the Government on the engine problems faced by the Type  vessels, Lord West hit out at “an appalling state of affairs”. He told peers: “We have six anti-air warfare ships, we knew eight years ago that they had a problem - that sometimes there would be a total lack of power, which would suddenly happen unexpectedly.

Mum-of-three Kate has embarked on a -hour tour of the country, visiting Birmingham, Cardf and Surrey to raise awareness of the poll, Five Big Questions on the Under Fives, thought to be the largest of its kind in the UK. She has been quietly working on the theme since her marriage eight years ago, dedicating the vast majority of her public and private engagements to early years provision. And this afternoon, she showed off her maternal side as she played with young children at a child-sized mini-city at a museum in Birmingham. Heartwarming photos show the -year-old engaging with the youngsters in play as she beams with happiness. She has determined that many of the hardest social challenges facing society can often be traced back to experiences in early childhood and has successfully made the subject her niche.

Kate said: The Early Years are more crucial for future health and happiness than any other moment in our letime.

The research was commissioned by the Royal Foundation, which hopes it will spark the biggest ever conversation on early childhood. The Duchess began her whistlestop tour with a visit to MiniBrum, an interactive, child-sized mini-city at Thinktank, Birmingham’s science museum. The Duchess said: What we experience between the ages of  and five shapes the developing brain. They help us avoid adversity, or certainly build resilience to adversity in later le, prevent challenges with mental health later down the line. As a mother, it’s given me a dferent perspective. There’s so much pressure on parents to feel the responsibility is just down to them but actually it’s important to work together as a community. The poll will be online for a month and is designed to recognise that everyone has a role in building the foundations of childhood that have a lelong effect. The results will be revealed in March and will determine the Duchess’s next steps. Kensington Palace said the launch of the survey followed eight years of work by the duchess who firmly believes that experiences in the earliest years – from in the womb to the age of five – are instrumental in shaping future lives. The five questions were compiled after meeting with families across the country and hearing about the issues they deal with day-to-day, reflecting the results of those conversations as well as those with academics, experts, organisations and practitioners. The Duchess will join parents at London Early Years Foundationnursery in Southwark, central London, for the nursery drop off tomorrow, before helping nursery workers serve breakfast to the children, highlighting the importance of nutritious food to a child’s development.

The majority featured US servicemen, servicewomen or their families driving on the wrong side of the road. Last year, the Mirror told how mum Judy Chard, , was lucky to escape with her le when a US soldier ploughed into her just miles from the base where Harry died. The -year-old’s stepfather Bruce Charles has told BBC Breakfast that the list of incidents dates back  years. He said: “I just think it’s shocking that this has been happening for so many years. “Nearly every single one of these cases involves a serviceman driving on the wrong side of the road. “It’s definitely a pattern.”  Bruce, married to Harry’s mum Charlotte, added: “A lot of it doesn’t get reported because there isn’t any dashcam footage of it, so things are mentioned and you hear about them but until you’ve actually seen it on film, you realise it’s happening quite often. “It has to stop. These bases have to realise they have issues with servicemen leaving the bases. “At the moment the bases don’t seem to really want to interact with us and engage with us, so it’s very hard but it is something we’re going to fight and fight for all the way, until we get results.”Motorcyclist Harry died last August after he was involved in a collision with diplomat’s we Anne Sacoolas, .

Police attended the home following a  call from Lorraine, , on February , . Lorraine has now been sentenced after initially being charged with manslaughter, which she denied, before pleading guilty to a lesser charge of neglect. Poor Kenny, god love him. Do you know what, he didn’t deserve this. He didn’t, she told the operator after explaining that Kenny wasnapost breathing. Such a lovely, lovely human being and he didn’t … nobody deserves to get dementia. Paramedics arrived and found Kenny, , slumped on a wheelchair outside the flat. Having been blocked from entering the main property by Juliette, the emergency service workers tried in vain to revive the pensioner, who was originally from Malaysia. He was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.  A post-mortem exam found two foul-smelling and very large and very deep pressure sores on his buttocks and lower back, along with several other sores. A pathologist said the sores would have been present for around three months before his death and would have caused him great pain. Gordon Cole QC, prosecuting, told Liverpool Crown Court: Despite the visibly rotting flesh no assistance from health care professionals was sought by his family. The pressure ulceration and infection reached his bones. Other areas of pressure damage followed. In excess of % of Mr Khan’s body surface was damaged.  At the time of his death Kenny had a range of serious health conditions including Lewy Body Dementia, bronchopneumonia, osteoarthritis, emphysema and liver disease. But it was the rancid pressure sores on his body that became infected and led to septicemia, which caused his death. Mr Cole described how PC Ward entered the squalid home. The door to the flat was slightly ajar, he said. PC Ward pushed the door open and immediately noticed an horrendous smell. He looked up the hallway and saw two females, Lorraine Khan and her daughter Juliette Khan.  They were married for more than  years and she found in him, and him in her, both security and love. Mr Power told the court that Lorraine felt overwhelming guilt about how her husband had died. Judge David Aubrey, QC, passing sentence, told her: He was an extremely ill person and you simply didnapost have the capability or wherewithal to care for him, he also being so immobile as a consequence of his illness.

I felt like being sick. I went downstairs and said I wanted to speak to the manager, she added. He offered me a refund and a new burger. I didnapost want one and asked how to make a proper complaint.  It was horrible - itaposs thrown me off my eating pattern, she added. I have been feeling quite nauseous. They should have things in place to stop this from happening. I donapost want to eat at any restaurant like that again. In an email to Ms Bogue, the restaurantaposs business manager admitted the mix-up was extremely disappointing. The email read: I have looked in this issue myself and it appears it was a traineeaposs error when finishing the product in the kitchen not being focused on the item at hand. Despite all the procedures in place, such as using a dferent color box and dferent color paper tray liner, the employee failed to fulfil this task to the standard we expect.

Both first cousins of William and Harry, Lady Kitty and Peteraposs dairy promotion campaigns kicked off in June last year, with products billing themselves as from Jersey cows and targeting the Chinese middle-class market. In her advert, model Lady Kitty is seen sipping tea in the famous museum while a Chinese woman pours milk from a carton titled aposSatine Jersey Milk British Museum Classic Editionapos.  Amongst the promotional material, the company played up her royal connections, despite her not being a member of the Royal Family. She is referred to as the niece of the late Princess Diana and said that she has shared the story of Jersey milk and the British Royal Family. While Lady Kitty herself is quoted as saying: Jersey milk has a close relationship with the British Royal Family. At Buckingham Palace, the official residence of the Queen in London, the Queen’s day begins with drinking a cup of tea.  Jersey milk has been enjoyed by the British Royal Family for many years. Jersey milk is considered to be the finest and most special from the United Kingdom. Lady Kitty grew up in South Africa with mum Victoria and has been based in London for five years, having signed with Storm Management.She posted a photo of herself at the Satine milk launch on Instagram , referring to the deal as a paid partnership with the British Museum.In a behind the scenes video she says she is thrilled...to celebrate the collaboration between the British Museum and Satine.  The Mail reports the museum took a fee for hosting the launch, describing it as commercially sensitive. A spokesman said: The British Museum started its brand licensing programme back in  and has an international programme, with select licensee partners in China, the UK, Europe and North America. The press release details the collaboration on this particular product and the role of the British Museum, whereby the design of the packaging for a specic product was inspired by objects in the British Museum’s collection.  Printed on the milk carton is ‘Satine – The British Museum’ alongside a sketch based on an  lithograph of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert with their children, titled The Royal Children in the Nursery. A copy of the original artwork is in the Royal Collection.Lady Kitty and Peteraposs involvement in lucrative deals comes as  Prince Harry  jetted off to Canada to reunite with we Meghan and son Archie after their decision to step down as senior royals.With their intention of working to become financially independent and having relinquished their titles and promised to repay public funding pumped into  Frogmore Cottage  , they have, however, been criticised over their plans to make millions in endorsements abroad. This includes potential deals with the likes of  Netflix  and Disney.In a behind the scenes interview for his promotions of aposJersey Fresh Milkapos, Peter says he and the other royals were brought up on Jersey milk and says itaposs a privilege to be part of an exciting new project to bring it to China. The -year-old and his sister Zara have never held HRH status and the siblings have been scrutinised before about how they make their money, reports the Mail. A caption for a promotional still of the advert describes Peter as a British Royal Family member while the advert itself features a replica of the coach the Queen uses on state occasions.

While the end of the bitterly cold spell is on the horizon, a Public Health England cold weather alert is still in place until am tomorrow, warning that the elderly, very young and people with medical conditions risk getting ill. And the Met Office is warning tonight could see temperatures fall to as low as -C overnight, before things improve tomorrow. This comes after Britain was blanketed in thick freezing fog and frost this morning, which saw cars overturn on icy roads and police issue ice warnings as driving conditions became treacherous. Visibility was as low as under ftand the UK was colder than Reykjavik in Iceland, which reached a low of C today. The lowest temperature recorded overnight was -.C in Oxfordshire. And tonight heading into tomorrow will see aof the below-freezing conditions, with the south and South West of England baring the brunt. Cloud will cover most regions of the UK as the skies turn even greyer than today. The south will be especially misty and murky tomorrow. Cloud in the far west and northwest will be thick enough for spots of patchy rain. Meanwhile there is a north-south ide, with Scotland and the North East look set to enjoy the best of the weather, with the possibility of temperatures hitting C tomorrow. Helen Roberts, a meteorologist with the Met Office , told : There was widespread frost this morning. There will certainly be some frost tonight, but not as much. There will be some fog in the far south of England, with freezing fog confined to south. It will be mostly freezing fog. The minimum temperature last night was -.C in Oxfordshire.Tonight we could see a low temperature -C, across the South West of England. It will be quite a grey start across large parts of the UK tomorrow morning, particularly in England and Wales, with low cloud and hill fog. It wonapost really brighten up for many throughout much of the day. It will feel cold under the cloud cover. But itaposs not all bad news, as the meteorologist said there will be a little brightness around for some. The best chance of brightness will be in the north east of England and eastern Scotland, she said.The maximum temperature we can expect in the far south tomorrow will be C or C, and C or C for much of the west of England. We could get as high as as C or C in the north east. Things are expected to get milder after the PHE cold weather alert expires around am tomorrow. But the meteorologist warns there could still be some slippery surfaces around, mainly caused by frost and especially in the south and South West, so motorists and pedestrians still need to take care.  Dr Ishani Kar-Purkayastha, Consultant in Public Health at Public Health England, said: People with heart and lung conditions, older people and the very young are at risk of becoming unwell during cold weather. At this time, it’s really important to keep a look out for friends and family who might be affected.

However, with a Public Health England cold weather alert due to be lted at am today, urging people to watch out for the most vulnerable, particularly the elderly, temperatures are set to get milder. But the cold snap will only make way for a miserable cloudy picture for many as well as plenty of mist and murks and hill fog too, according to BBC meteorologist Stav Danaos. While satellite images show heavy fog is to blanket much of the UK tonight. And that will be followed by aof heavy bands of rain by the weekend. Today sees  flood alerts in place across England, though no severe weather warnings, after yesterdayaposs freezing fog which caused havoc for motorists.  On Tuesday, Britain was blanketed in thick freezing fog and frost for the morning commute, which saw cars overturn on icy roads and police issue ice warnings as driving conditions became treacherous. Visibility was as low as under ftand the UK was colder than Reykjavik in Iceland, which reached a low of C. Pictures circulating online included that of a van overturned in Devon on the road between Tedburn St Mary and Crediton.  The Met Officeaposs long range weather forecast is predicting heavy showers from Sunday moving across the southeast of the UK, accompanied by a strengthening wind and wintry precipitation. The north and west are likely to see the wettest and windiest spells, with the occasional risk of snow on higher ground, the forecast continues. The south and east should stay slightly more settled, though there will still likely be some wet and windy periods.  Any settled spells between fronts will lead to some brighter conditions and isolated overnight frosts, but these will likely be short-lived. Temperatures generally around average in the north and just above in the south. Referring to today, Mr Danaos said: High pressure still with us for Wednesday but it will start to import some less cold air off the near continent.  It will be more moisture laden, so even though Wednesday is going to be largely dry, thanks to high pressure, itaposs going to be pretty cloudy with leaden skies thanks to all that moisture.     So...quite a cloudy picture for many, barely any holes in that cloud, and there could be some mist and murks, and hill fog too. UK  day weather forecast Today: Some light rain and drizzle affecting parts of the northwest. Elsewhere, most places dry but largely cloudy with mist and fog in places, especially on hills. Some sunny spells, mainly in the northeast. Feeling chilly in the south. Tonight: Continuing mostly dry but with cloudy skies in most places.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailPrince Harry and Meghan Markle have begun talks with an elite Hollywood team they hope can set them up with multi-million-dollar deals. Their former royal highnesses have put the wheels in motion with the powerful agents, business managers and lawyers Meghan secretly retained throughout her time in the British Royal Family. The team features Nick Collins of The Gersh Agency, whose clients include Tobey Maguire and Jamie Foxx – he is handling lucrative film, TV and philanthropic offers. Meghan’s Beverly Hills business manager Andrew Meyer is working behind the scenes too, with Hollywood lawyer Rick Genow also heavily involved. The gurus were brought together to help Harry, , and Meghan, , become “financially independent” despite still receiving a supply of cash from Harry’s dad Prince Charles for the next  months. Already one of Netflix ’s most senior bosses, chief content officer Ted Sarandos, has said the online streaming company would welcome a deal with the royals. The couple will also discuss how to promote causes close to their hearts, including the environment and the fight against HIV and AIDS. The terms of separation from the monarchy were harsher than both Harry and Meghan had lobbied for when they announced Megxit. Harry yesterday grinned as he arrived in Canada, having cast a solemn figure as he left the gruelling nine-hour British Airways flight from Heathrow to Vancouver. But after a transfer flight to Vancouver Island, Harry’s demeanour had changed and he smiled broadly. One passenger on board the plane said they suspected Meghan was waiting inside a Toyota SUV that pulled up nearby. The couple had been separated for  days while the Prince finished his final engagement as a senior royal in Britain. Hours before leaving London on Monday, the Prince raced through an official engagement with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and African leaders.

Keane Mulready-Woods, , was beheaded and his body cut up as part of a gang war. His remains were found in a sports bag and his head in a burnt out car after he was reported missing from Drogheda, Co Louth, two weeks ago. It is feared that his death could prompt further horric reprisals in the gruesome style of El Chapoaposs Sinaloa cartel which beheaded and dismembered its victims, reports the Daily Star . A source said: “The Mexicans take it to another level and the Irish have copied. “Shooting someone isn’t enough now – you’ve got to cut them up and put it on social media.  “But where does it end  Keane will just be the first of many.” The news emerged as it was claimed a thug from the UK has joined the bitter gang war. It is alleged they are protecting Irish mob boss Cornelius Price – who has an £, bounty on his head. The hardened criminal was released from prison last year after serving a three-year sentence for reckless endangerment of a police officer. A source claimed: “Price and his gang are at the centre of this feud and they know they’re under serious pressure from the people who killed Keane Mulready-Woods.“It’s not the first time he has drafted in supporters from the UK because, when he’s under pressure, he surrounds himself with people he can trust. It’s also concerning that people from outside the area could be dragged into this feud.” Irish cops have established a strong presence in Drogheda in a bid to prevent any more outbreaks of violence. After an informal meeting in August last year, Gardai were told that the feud would not end until three enemies were dead, the Irish Sun reported.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailWith a jolt of emotion, Anita Romer recognised her dad in the photograph instantly. His numb expression brought to le with flesh tones, the filthy blue and white fabric of his degrading striped unorm now painfully tangible, she couldn’t fail to. This is her late father Eugene Spiegel, aged just , and six years before she was born, caught on camera in a desperate moment when he must have lost all hope of a future, let alone fatherhood.Anita, , movingly describes the unexpected moment last week when she came face to face with her dad in this image, standing within Hitler’s most notorious death camp, Auschwitz , in one of a selection of newly colourised black and white photographs taken there in May, .The shots, taken by SS guards, have been tinted for use in a new documentary, Auschwitz Untold: In Colour, to be shown on More on Sunday and Monday, to coincide with the th anniversary of the liberation, by Soviet forces, of the camp where .million were murdered. Their new treatment is intended to make real the horrors of the holocaust for a young, modern audience. But Anita, from London, only too well aware of what both her parents suffered there, is also sharply reminded with vivid new veracity of Eugene’s experience of hell on earth. Not least because, within the delicate profile of this scared young man, standing on Auschwitz’s railway ramp amid hordes of disorientated new arrivals, she could see a mirror image of her own -year-old son.  She says: “We were completely and utterly and totally overcome. The whole thing was very, very moving and brought it all back home. “It has been so long, we have heard so much, but still when you see the person in the unorm that represents such evil, it’s a shock over and over again. “To see him in that unorm is awful. My daughter-in-law can’t bear to look at the picture because it looks so much like her husband.” Somehow, Eugene survived Auschwitz, as did his we, Margaret – although the pair lost each other for over a year after liberation, assuming each other dead before they were miraculously reunited.  But both found it too painful to speak fully of the horrors they faced, so this image sheds new light on what they must have experienced. Anita has seen it once before, but only in black and white, and only the detail showing the men in striped garb. Seeing it in colour, within the context of the wider scene, has been “overwhelming”. Taken around a month after Eugene and Margaret first arrived in Auschwitz, her father stands within the confused crowds who have been forced out of the stinking cattle trucks that have transported them.  The line of waiting arrivals before him is made up of women, some elderly, and children. A lady carrying a baby is being directed by guards to her fate. It was the frail, especially the middle-aged and old, and the very young, who were generally selected on arrival to go straight to the gas chambers, rather than being set to slave labour. Eugene, after a month in the camp, would have known what faced them, but been unable to warn them. Anita remembers he told her he narrowly avoided it himself.  “My father was always a frail looking man,” she says. “And when he arrived, he arrived with a brother, and my father was placed in one line and his brother in the other. I presume my father was placed in the line that was going to be gassed. “He insisted he wanted to be with his brother, and for some reason they didn’t shoot him on the spot, they said OK, and they let him move lines. It would have saved his le.” This collection of colourised photographs were all taken on Auschwitz’s infamous arrivals ramp, and form part of what is now named The Auschwitz Album, the only surviving visual evidence of the process leading to the mass murder at Auschwitz-Birkenau. The original purpose of the SS images is not known, although the guards thought to have taken them, Ernst Hofmann or Bernhard Walte, were also tasked with taking ID photos and fingerprints of the inmates.  The photos all show the arrival of Hungarian Jews, many from the Berehovo Ghetto. They demonstrate the sheer scale of the transports, and the confusion and fear of those who arrived via an inhumane journey, their coats decorated with humiliating yellow stars. It is believed to be the first time images inside concentration camps have been colourised, although some colour film was taken at the time. “We hope the series will help remove a barrier that separates contemporary audiences from the realty of the Holocaust so that we will never forget the atrocities of the past,” explained development producer Sheldon Lazarus, who had the idea when he saw his own daughter struggle to grasp the truth of the event at school. Eugene and Margaret arrived at Auschwitz from a small town called Ung, now in Ukraine, in April .  “That is why in this picture he is still looking fairly well - after a few months he wouldn’t have looked like this,” says Anita. Eugene had worked for his family’s banking firm, Margaret for her family’s women’s clothing shop. Both their sets of parents were gassed immediately they arrived Eugene also lost a brother and sister, and Margaret a young brother. The couple was separated in the camp. While Margaret was liberated there on January , , Eugene was sent on a death march with his surviving brother to the camp of Buchenwald, which wasn’t liberated until May. One of very few recollections he did tell his family was that his brother saved his le a second time. Anita says: “On the death march my father was already very ill and just wanted to give up, but his brother just carried him on his back, he wouldn’t let him.”  Eugene had TB, and was taken to an American hospital in Germany after liberation. Meanwhile, Margaret had ed to Ung, and finding no surviving family, moved to Budapest to work in a bleak attempt to support herself. There, by miraculous chance, she met someone who had seen the name Spiegel on a survivors’ list. It was Eugene, and she travelled to find him in hospital. “This must have been at least a year after liberation,” says Anita. “She thought he had gone - and he must have thought she had.” It took two years in a sanatorium for Eugene to recover, and then the couple moved to South America to begin a new le.

that it’s only girls who get spiked.“Boys get spiked too and some people simply do it for a misguided laugh.“I think the best deterrent is to never leave your drink unattended, but we thought we should do our bit to help.”A statement from Girls Against Spiking said: “We wanted to do something to help tackle Scotland’s mental health crisis so it features Samaritans contact details as well as others which can help with a host of issues.“We have thousands of these coasters which have been distributed to every police ision in Scotland, who will then further distribute them in their local area to licensed premises.”Elaine Hindal, CEO of Drinkaware, said: “If somebody you know starts to feel strange or more drunk than expected, or you suspect their drink has been spiked, it is important to get medical help straight away.“Drink covers are just one of a number of ways that may help reduce the likelihood of your drink being spiked – for example, not accepting a drink from someone you don’t know and never leaving your drink.“Our advice is to stay vigilant – don’t drink too much in the first place, stick with your friends and have a safe plan for getting home.“Many venues adopt alcohol awareness training schemes for their staff and these usually cover how to recognise drink-spiking.”Nicola Johnston, Aberdeen Inspired economy manager, said: “Aberdeen Inspired is supportive of any initiative that encourages safety in the night-time economy.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/01/EE-CJS-080120-1-12-789x564.jpg ","title":"refurbished

showdown","story":"Captain Joe Lewis today challenged Aberdeen to lay down a European marker by defeating rivals Motherwell tomorrow.The Steelmen hold the Premiership’s third spot, which brings automatic Europa League qualication for next season.Victory over ‘Well at Pittodrie tomorrow would push Aberdeen into third – where Lewis aims to finish the campaign.Last season the Dons faced a nervous sweat on a sixth straight Euro qualication after finishing fourth and had to wait on Celtic winning the Scottish Cup.This time Lewis wants European action secured automatically by finishing third and realises overcoming Motherwell is pivotal.Lewis said: “Motherwell is a huge game as they have been very consistent and have been winning game after game.“They are a strong side but it is a match we are certainly looking to win. The last time we played Motherwell we won - and scored three brilliant goals.“That was one of our best performances along with our - win over Kilmarnock. We will need to something close to that level to get the job done again.“It was away from home against dficult opposition and we did really well with a lot of players playing out of position.“We will be looking to replicate that, but we know Motherwell will be better than they were that day.”Aberdeen ed from the Premiership winter shutdown with a - Scottish Cup fourth round defeat of League One Dumbarton at Pittodrie.In the aftermath of that narrow victory over the part-timers, Dons boss Derek McInnes confirmed he aims to sign a player with a creative spark in the January transfer window. He has already made an attempt to sign St Johnstone winger Matty Kennedy this month to bring creativity.Kennedy had agreed a pre- contract for the summer, but the Dons want him in now.If a deal to secure Kennedy this month cannot be thrashed out McInnes will move on to other signing targets.However, Lewis reckons in signing Dylan McGeouch from Sunderland, they have already landed a player who can turn games with his skill.Lewis said: “Dylan is a fantastic signing for us. He is very good on the ball, positive and energetic and is a big addition to the squad.“Hopefully he can affect the way we are playing and can be an integral part going forward.“We have competition in the squad now and that will be important going forward.”Aberdeen had  shots against Dumbarton but it took a late penalty from Sam Cosgrove to beat the part-timers and prevent an unwanted replay.Their reward is a home clash against Premiership Kilmarnock on the weekend of February .Lewis said: “The important thing about any cup game is getting through to the next round.“It was a quiet game for me as the back four did their jobs.“The two centre-halves completely nullied everything that came into our half.“Attacking-wise against Dumbarton, on another day we could have had four or five goals.“As long as it is - you always run the risk of them popping up with something, but we dealt with everything and there were no dramas.“After having the break, for the Premiership teams it is important to get back to winning ways – which we did.“Obviously, it wasn’t the emphatic goal scoring victory we wanted but it was a win. We kept putting the ball in the box and kept trying to do the right things.“Eventually it wasn’t luck or a fluke but persistence with Sam getting in the right areas.“The lad brought him down and it was a clear penalty which Sam put away – as he usually does.”For the Scottish Cup tie the Dons transformed the Merkland Stand into an “active area” for fans who want to stand and sing in support of Aberdeen.Lewis hopes the “Red Shed” can be incorporated at every home game for next season.He said: “The initiative from the club with the Red Shed is a brilliant idea.“The club has to be commended for it and the fans for buying into it.“Everyone wants a better atmosphere here and hopefully that can be the start of things.“Certainly against Dumbarton at home when most people would have come here expecting us to win and quite often the fans are waiting for something from the pitch.“We could hear the supporters and no disrespect to Dumbarton, but in the bigger games they can make a dference.“A good atmosphere at Pittodrie can be points on the board for us.”"},{"url":null,"title":"a mid argyll rugby blast from the past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Donald Carmichael handed in this black and white photograph of a Mid Argyll Rugby Club team of many decades ago.But can our readers name the players  And what background can you give us about this photograph and Mid Argyll Rugby club at the time Contact the Argyllshire Advertiser by email: editor@argyllshireadvertiser with any information."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event. And to Gavin #Top Tog# Brown, who has been an avid rally man for years and continued to watch us all through the lens, capturing some of our most heroic moments. was a busy year, with a few of us still tinkering away in sheds.  will hopefully see theof Ally and Del Galbraith in their #new# MK Escort and Donald Bowness in the giant killing Nova making aafter some time out.PICS:Dougie Watt and Ian Parker flying in Finland before winning in Aberdeen Photo: Jii Pihlaja. no_a_RallyFinlandFather and son duo Craig and Ross Callendar came in th overall at this year#s Mull Rally.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"storm brendan the movie","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA compilation of clips from ious points on the Mid Argyll coastline showing the impact of Storm Brendan on Monday January , .Even with less-than-Hollywood editing it#s pretty dramatic stuff."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along.

Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival.

fire that destroyed a large part of the building last year.The replacement secondary, though, will take at least three years to build.But according to Scottish Borders Councilrsquos Chief Executive Tracey Logan, it is the only way forward for Peebles High.Although it is yet to be officially endorsed by the local authority, Ms Logan says her view is that apart from the Sports Complex and Millennium Wing, the entire school will be demolished and rebuilt.And that Peebles High will jump to the head of the queue in the rebuilding programme of schools - ahead of Galashiels, Hawick and Selkirk.But the Chief Executive told the towns Community Council she thinks Peebles should now be first on the priority list for a new school.Ms Logan explained: ldquoAt the moment my view is, and this is only my view, this has not even endorsed by the Council as yet, is that given the constraints that we have around what will be available financially, the Scottish Government have been really helpful in that they are offering their full support and we will make a bid late spring for funding through the schools programme.ldquoThere will obviously be a financial settlement from the insurance.\"But we need to find the best way forward, so my expectation is that we will retain the Sports Complex because it is undamaged and pretty new, we will also retain the Millennium Wing because again itrsquos not that old and is entirely usable.ldquoI would imagine that we will probably end up taking away everything  and replace it with something new.\"What that will look like, I have no idea. But what it will be is something that is modular that we can add ontowe need to for capacity and we will want to talk to the community about what  we might want to put into that site.A consultation will take place asking for local feedback on community space and the possible provision of health and social care.She added: ldquoSome people have said to me that they want to knock all of the school down including the fairly new bits, realistically that wonrsquot happen and itrsquos not the right thing to do. I think itrsquos important that we make sure people understand the parameters within which we are working so we can have some sensible conversations and that we try and accommodate as much as we can in there.Meanwhile, a major operation is underway to get the students back to their classrooms at the beginning of February.The Chief Executive said: ldquoWe put in arrangements for  plus pupils to be accommodated at locations in Peebles, Galashiels Academy and the Langlee complex.ldquoThat has been generally very successfully and the feedback from that has been positive. I absolutely acknowledge that itrsquos not perfect but it has done the job we needed it do to.Senior students are currently sitting prelim exams in the Sports Complex and this will continue until the end of January.Temporary classroom units are being erected within the school grounds and pupils are to be accommodated in unaffected areas of the building.ldquoThere are still huge amounts of work going on and we will go right up to the wire but Irsquom confident we will achieve it, added Ms Logan.The Council has decided on a phased approach with S to S students starting on Monday, February  and S to S working from home and ing the following day.Ms Logan said that there has been ldquocompromises in the education offer over the last few weeks but is assuring parents that from the beginning of February it will be ldquobusiness as usual.Demolition work on the damaged building has been completed and restricted access has been implemented.The council boss has assured parents that children will only be able to access safe routes throughout the school building.Ms Logan added: ldquoOne of the things we did lose in the fire was the vast majority of pupil toilets so what wersquove now got on site is the long term temporary arrangements supplemented over the course of January.To ensure pupil safety, traffic will enter the site from a new access via Craigerne Road located at the back of the school.Ms Logan is meeting with insurers this week to discuss a settlement figure which will help form the direction of the future of Peebles High School.She added: ldquoAll of what we are doing is going to be sustainable for whatever we do in terms of the proper rebuild.\"What Irsquom trying to reassure you is that wersquore not doing things that are very temporary, whatever we do, we will be looking to the future.Community councillor Graham Mackie commended the local authority on doing a ldquoremarkable job and said any criticism of the Council during this trying time was unnecessary.He said: ldquoIt has been thought for several years that we needed a completely new high school but possibly therersquos a silver lining here in that we can end up with a high school that will meet the needs of the current population.\"But the council chief told members that ldquoessentially this is the replacement.She explained: ldquoWhen it comes to looking at high schools and replacement we would always look to retain what is still workable.\"In the case of the bits we are talking about in terms of Peebles High site they are really not that old. The Millennium Wing meets the standards that would be required in a new building. There would be very little point in wasting money knocking down something that works really well.

This is a fascinating and picturesque structure from the th century, which lies semi-hidden amongst the trees that cling onto the steep sides of the slope.Dunglass is such a beautul area, and the ancient Dunglass Collegiate Church, dating from the th century, is one of its architectural jewels. Itrsquos open to the elements now, but well preserved and a popular place for weddings.The castle that once stood nearby is long gone. A more modern house sits on the spot where a mansion once stood, and before that the castle. Being on the main route south, the castle inevitably saw action during the ious times of war with England, being burned and damaged on a number of occasions in the s.But in August , the castle was effectively blown up in a huge explosion, and a version of events emerged which placed the blame on a vengeful servant called Edward Paris.It was a time of war and religious rage. Thomas the nd Earl of Haddington was leading a Covenanting force charged with defending this important route from the south, as the Covenanting army had entered England a few days earlier. He had established his force at Dunglass Castle, an obvious strategic location, to defend the armyrsquos rear.On that fateful day, August , , he was said to be in conversation with some fellow nobles when a huge explosion erupted from the vaults, instantly demolishing the central part of the castle which became little more than a pile of debris.Thomas and many others were killed, their bodies pulled from the rubble. They had been crushed by the collapse of the walls in the explosion.History has repeatedly recorded the names of the nobles killed on that day, but there were many others, as the castle was busy and full of people. Fty-four unnamed lsquocommon servantsrsquo were killed, and more than  other people badly injured, some later dying of their injuries.Edward Paris was Thomasrsquos servant and he has been blamed for this tragedy. The th-century writer Andrew Stevenson claimed Edward had the keys to the vault in which huge amounts of gunpowder had been stored, and he had been ldquoseduced by the enemies of the covenant to commit this act. He was an Englishman and another account says he was incensed at derogatory remarks made by Thomas about his countrymen.Irsquove always thought this explanation never really had the ring of truth. It was initially deemed an accident, and the story of Edwardrsquos role emerged later, instigated by a writer called William Lithgow, a man who had certain axes to grind. In one account, Edward is said to have thrust a hot poker into the gunpowder or set fire to it. The detail of this is suspect in itself, for who survived as a witness to this act  I suspect that a dreadful accident, possibly caused by incompetence and carelessness, was turned into a deliberate act of vengeance as it made a more useful explanation.Of course, it is very possible that Edward was offended or annoyed at things said by his master, and perhaps he mentioned this at some stage, later to be used as evidence of his guilt. But in truth, most servants will have seen or heard things which will have offended them, it was a part of their job.Imagineservants had been able to write and publish the things they had overheard and seen, what dferent historical narratives we would have!Motives for wanting to interpret the cause of the explosion in this way can be guessed at. It was a time of atrocity and massacre, with religious, political and national hatreds. Who was responsible for the dangerous stockpiling of the gunpowder in such a manner  It seems just too easy to blame a disgruntled servant. Even later, when writing up this period, religious and political loyalties influenced interpretation.If Edward Paris really did venture down to the vaults of Dunglass Castle on that fateful day, with the intention of committing suicide in order to kill his master, along with dozens of others, then he must have been infected with a deep hatred, as well as a total disregard for the lives of his fellow servants and his own.The truth is we will never know what really happened. But Edward Paris is a servant whose name we know.

A marine licence is in place until the end of May, with work to be complete before then.At the same time, plans are being drawn up for a second phase of work, which would see the creation of a breakwater at the northern end of the beach.A marine licence will be needed for that piece of work, with the hope that could be in place before the end of May to allow work to simply continue from the first phase.If that is not possible, the contractor will leave the site andat a later date to construct the northern breakwater.Mrs Swan, who is also chairwoman of Dunbar Shore and Harbour Neighbourhood Group, encouraged people to head along to the public exhibition, which takes place between pm and pm.Those in attendance can speak to the consultants and East Lothian Council about the plans.Mrs Swan added: ldquoI think it is really, really important for people to come to the exhibition for two reasons.ldquoOne is to understand the thinking that has gone into the regeneration project and the other one is to become aware of the impact it might have on them during the construction weeks because it is going to be at least six weeks and it could run into months.ldquoThe nature of the breakwater is they are built of huge rocks, between three and six tonnes, and they are all coming from the quarry at Markle.

He was said to have been martyred at sea with an anchor round his neck and was therefore regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The cult of Clement spread to Scandinavia in about the th century and then to Britain.ldquoSt Clements Wells were probably named by Scandinavians living in the Tranent area.ldquoWe know they were here because of the presence of a powerful landholder of likely Scandinavian descent, Thor of Tranent, son of Swain, who is mentioned in many th-century charters. He held extensive lands in the area and granted the church of Tranent to Holyrood Abbey.Mr Hadden said: ldquoI am sure the new stone sculptures will add another piece of culture to our area when in place to the east and west sides of Wallyford alongside those we have already.ldquoThese include the mining memorial stone and coal hutches located at St Clements Housing estate just off Salters Road, the  mining stones at the Wallyford Bing, a community woodland depicting dferent mining scenes, and also the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh memorial at the west side of Wallyford.The shapes and patterns proposed relate to the themes of the wells, water, ripples, distilling, agriculture and the sense of space and open skies of the site as it is now. The overall idea is that the artwork reflects past, present and future heritages of the area.There will also be two St Clements Wells name  per entrance in stone, either hand carved or sandblasted.The idea for a stone village sign for Wallyford is also being explored in a design reflecting the ideas of crossing a river or burn by a ford.A spokesman for East Lothian Developments said: ldquoEast Lothian Developments are delighted to be working with Susheila and James to deliver ious artworks at St Clements Wells.ldquoThey have shown real enthusiasm and creativity with the ideas they have brought forward to capture something of the history of St Clements Wells and design pieces which we hope will do justice to the entrances of the development, and spark interest from all those who will pass them.ldquoWe were very grateful to the community council for their comments and input to the designs.Elaine Di Troia was appointed vice-chairman at the AGM, Sharon Jamieson secretary and Beryl Stevenson treasurer.

Perhaps at her age she didnrsquot understand exactly what was going on inside, but all she knew was that her granny shersquod loved was gone and she missed her.Then one evening during a bedtime story, Jessica started to cry and told her dad that her granny was melting like a snowman.

So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum. It was a terrying thought and it made her not just sad but scared and insecure inside.Her dad tried to reassure her that he or her mum werenrsquot going to die, but despite being only six years old, Jessica now knew that such promises couldnrsquot be kept forever.ldquoNana didnrsquot want to die either, but she did.

And it ainrsquot pretty. In fact, itrsquos getting downright scary, especially as every week the narrative seems to sht closer to the isive and damaging - but also very deliberate - culture wars being waged in Trumprsquos America.We witnessed this first hand over the last couple of weeks with the grim spectacle of groups of well-spoken middle class white men, mostly of a certain age, being rounded up and brought into television studios to sit on sofas next to black women and explain to them not only what racism is and is not, but also why theirlived experiences of it are worthless. And, when the women speakers pointed out the irony and injustice of this set-up  Calm down dear, yoursquore getting hysterical.Question Time provided perhaps the most eye-watering example of this when actor Lawrence Fox - who had been invited to sit in the ldquovoice of the people chair - unleashed a shocking but very revealing attack on a mixed-race member of the audience who suggested Meghan Marklersquos treatment by the media and others had been racist.:The curse of the House of Windsor: how love has torn apart the royal familyMr Fox, a Harrow-educated member of an established acting dynasty known for his role in the detective series Lewis, tore into the woman - who it turns out is an academic researcher in race and ethnicity - talking over her, aggressively calling the suggestion of racism ldquoboring, adding imperiously: ldquoWersquore the mostly tolerant, lovely country in the world.\" The actor compounded matters by using the tired and predictable ldquoyoursquore the racist defence when quite reasonably questioned on how a spfing white chap like him could be so sure about what racism is and is not.:Netflix chief confirms interest in deal with Harry and MeghanI donrsquot doubt that from Mr Foxrsquos privileged perch, Britain is indeed tolerant and lovely. It is certainly still tolerant of and shockingly reverent towards posh types like him who ignorantly and arrogantly skip through le with a wealthy family to pick them upthings donrsquot go their way. Laughably, most of the similar types Irsquove met in le honestly believe they earn their opportunities on merit.The ennui of privilege, eh  They tend to be bored with uppity totty of all races, of course. Theyrsquore probably terribly fed up with feckless poor people banging on about foodbanks, and moany, chippy Jocks, too.Itrsquos the soaring confidence of such attacks and pronouncements that really concerns me, however, the increasingly loud and proud tone of them, the whf of US right-wing s like Fox News, Breitbart and One American News Network.Indeed, rather than apologising or stepping back from his embarrassingly outburst on Question Time, Mr Fox, who has been roundly criticised by his profession, saw fit to launch a defence of his actions, including a barrage of mocking, wince-inducing tweets packed with right-wing US tropes around ldquoliberals and ldquowokeness. Whatrsquos going on  We simply wouldnrsquot have tolerated such behaviour in public  years ago.But with Boris Johnson in Number , a man who defends his writings about ldquopiccaninnies with ldquowater melon smiles, ldquobum boys ldquogirly swats and how voting Tory will ldquogive your we bigger breasts, I suppose such behaviour has both permission and a champion.Make no mistake, the faction of the Tory party that has taken over Britain in the wake of Brexit will revel in and stoke culture wars of this kind. It feels threatened by attacks on pale, male stale dominance, of course. But such isiveness also works as the ultimate distraction technique, stealing our focus away from the deliberate running down of public services, the re-writing of the social contract.And so far itrsquos working a treat."},{"url":null,"title":"lifetime-bans-gobby-cinema-theatre-goers","story":"\"Youve just had a McDonalds.\"\"Im hungry now.

Hate to break it to you, chum, but its been going for the past  minutes.\"When will they stop dancing \" Oh pal, did no one tell you  Buckle in, because theyre not stopping.The woman next to us very politely turns round and shushes them. It does no good. They are out for the afternoon, they are going to make a loud and long fuss over a Capri Sun and they are going to keep talking about their hunger levels for the entire performance.Its not long before another woman brings her mobile phone out and starts taking photographs of the stage.A trip to the cinema long ago became an interesting gamble to see, notsomeone would talk all the way through the film, but how many people would talk all the way through the film.There should be a points system devised to at least make a fun game out of what is a rotten situation. Only one point for talking as its hardly worth mentioning now. Two points for checking the time on their brightly lit mobile phone. Three points for checking Facebook or searching a website.Four points for taking a phone call during the movie. And five points for taking a selfie with the flash on.I earned  points at a screening of Its a Wonderful Le a few days before Christmas. I believe people have, generally, become more inconsiderate as going out to the cinema has become cheaper. Cinema loyalty cards are a brilliant idea but, when youre not physically handing over cash for a ticket, it feels less important an experience. Folk behave as though theyre in their living rooms.\"Do you want some of this flask of tea \" called one of a family of six along the row behind us at Its A Wonderful Le. There was lots of chat in reply about said flask. The two youngest members of the family talked incessantly about nothing. Two older women with them were similarly having a right old chinwag. My friend asked the two younger ones to please be quiet. They ignored the request and kept going.\"Shut up!\" shouted someone from along the row. I cracked towards the end of the film and askedthey could please, please be quiet for just five minutes. \"Well try two and see how we get on,\" said the older woman, sarcastically, as the young adults sniggered. \"So rude,\" snapped the other older woman, to me. Its meant to be a nicer crowd at the Glasgow Film Theatre but standards have clearly slipped.The two women spent the last minutes of the film having a bellowing sing-a-long. It was bonkers but bog standard cinema behaviour.Back to the theatre though, and I was gutted at the ballet being utterly ruined.Ballet is not an art form thats for everyone. But even with bored children - and I do sympathise - its a good le lesson to learn to sit politely and be aware of your impact on other people. Its brilliant to get children interested and involved in the theatre but its one thing to be talking about the performance and another to just chat away like youre in your house.Its time to take a stand rather than just moaning about it after the fact. Complain, complain, complain to venues as the inconsiderate behaviour is happening.Venues: Can we have ushers, please  If people cant behave then they need babysat. And take a one strike approach. One complaint and youre out.Theatre and the cinema are secular churches, places where we gather together socially to think about about society, culture, experiences other than our own.

But where does that get us, in the end, other than to the point where certain people are effectively prohibited from talking about certain issues in polite society I confess that I thought twice about choosing this topic for this column for precisely that reason. It will give me nothing but trouble. Irsquoll get tweets and emails which wonrsquot be nice to read, and for which a thick skin will be required.:Queen lsquosupportiversquo of lsquonew lersquo for Harry and MeghanHowever, I canrsquot accept that here in Britain, which has spread freedom of speech all over the world, we should be fearful of practising it ourselves.In truth, I donrsquot knowBritain is a racist country. I instinctively recognise Britain as a global leader in tolerance and integration, but self-criticism is integral to ensuring that it doesnrsquot become complacent.I suppose it depends on onersquos definition. Are there racists  Of course, but that would make every country in the world racist by definition, and there is a good argument to be made that the digital loudspeaker of social media has brought into public the behaviour that was always taking place amongst a small minority in private.But those people are the lowest of our society, and Irsquom not sure we can label our country according to their behaviour. So is there, then, racist-enabling behaviour by people who should know better  Yes, and of course the oft-quoted example is Boris Johnsonrsquos ldquoletter-boxes description of Muslim women wearing the Niqab. I do not think that the Prime Minister is racist, but I do think that people in a lofty position need to understand the effect that their language could have on the way others behave.What we are insinuating in the case of the Duchess, though, is altogether dferent. We are saying that Britain is an institutionally racist country. With that I confess, I have some trouble.In deconstructing her media coverage, there are elements of no doubt and elements of doubt.It is of no doubt that her coverage has, since her wedding, been diametrically opposed to that of her sister-in-law the Duchess of Cambridge. Thatrsquos perfectly obvious, and those who hold up a mirror to the sympathetic ndash some might say sycophantic ndash coverage Kate received when she ldquolovingly cradled her baby bump, comparing it to the ldquowhy canrsquot Meghan stop touching her bump  headlines are correct. There is no shortage of other examples.That the coverage is dferent is in no doubt. But, surely, we are capable of having a deeper and calmer conversation about why the coverage is dferent. Because we have jumped a step here. We have said the headlines are dferent , ergo the British press is racist . We have not analysed why the coverage is dferent .Now, it is imperative that as part of our considerations of step two we include race. Becausethe Duchess of Sussexrsquos media coverage is dferent to that of the Duchess of Cambridge because of her race, then that is a matter of national seriousness which would require a seismic response.:From crowns to contracts...what lies ahead for Harry and Meghan Butit is not because of that ndashit is for entirely unrelated reasons ndash then it is dangerous for us to blindly accept that it is.What other reasons might there be Well, let us remember that when the relationship began her media coverage was excellent indeed it was seen universally as being a welcome development that Harry was in a relationship with a person of mixed race.But the press then began to believe that Meghan Markle is not a royalist. Right or wrong, they now see someone who doesnrsquot love or respect the traditions of the Royal Family, who doesnrsquot enjoy her role within it, who doesnrsquot relish being an understudy to the more senior members of it, and who acts out the ldquoDuchess Dficult persona in reality.For the record, I am not a Royalist either. Although Irsquom not hugely exercised by the existence of the Royals or their role in our constitution, I am a republican. Butthere is one thing around which the British press unites it is its Royalism. So perhaps it is little wonder it takes a dimmer view of the Duchess of Sussex than it does of the Duchess of Cambridge.And herersquos the critical point. If that is why the press treats her badly, then that may be unfair, but it is not racist because it has nothing to do with her race. When the Duchess of Cornwall, for instance, endured years, decades, of negative coverage, self-evidently nobody suspected the press had a race issue.I know the press Irsquove worked with them for the best part of two decades. I need to be persuaded that journalists and headline writers have Meghan Marklersquos skin colour in their minds when they are writing about her.ButI am wrong, then letrsquos hear it. Letrsquos talk about it. Calmly. Letrsquos see evidence. If I canrsquot spot discrimination because Irsquom not subject to it, I need to know how to do better.

strong it killed off much of a Scottish islandrsquos entire growth of heather for the year.The Braer Storm which struck in  was the product of a the most intense cyclone ever recorded over the northern Atlantic, a force of nature which delivered hurricane-force winds to parts of northern Scotland and left its mark on the landscape.It was also responsible for the destruction of the tanker MV Braer ndash which gave the storm its name ndash which was already floundering on rocks on the Shetland Isles.The oil which spilled from the wreck has been blamed for wreaking Scotlandrsquos worst ever environmental disaster when , tonnes of oil leaked into the sea.However, the storm also had another affect on le in the area, which has not been understood until now.A project to study St Kildarsquos Soay sheep ndash the rare ruminants left behind on the island when it was abandoned in the s ndash has found that the amount of heather on the island declined incredibly after the  storm.It is thought that the severe winds whipped up by the storm carried salt from the sea on to the land, poisoning the heather and killing off much of that yearrsquos growth.Professor Michael Crawley of Imperial College London has been leading the research effort on the island, which has been collecting data on the quantity of heather for the last  years.Professor Crawley, from the Faculty of Le Sciences, said: ldquoA plant of particular interest is heather, and our long-term data clearly show that since about  the plants have been fluctuating but gradually increasing despite the grazing.ldquoWhat we noticed was that from , when this part of the study began, there was a steep rise in the abundance of taller heather.ldquoIt is most likely, although of course we canrsquot know for sure, is that this followed severe heather die-back at some stage before August . ldquoThe most likely cause is inundation by salt spray during a winter storm.The  Braer Storm developed as a weak frontal wave on January , , before moving rapidly northeast, bringing severe blizzards across much of Scotland.It also had a cataclysmic effect for the oil tanker MV Braer, which was had been stranded on rocks at Quendale Bay, just west of Sumburgh Head the week before.The ship, which was carrying crude oil from Norway and was bound for Canada lost power and drted on to the rocks, and efforts to tow it off had got under way just before the storm arrived.Already leaking oil, the tanker dumped its entire load into the waters when it was broken up by the storm, leading to the deaths of around , seabirds, according to the WWF.It also led to a ban on seafood from the area, including farmed salmon, but this was soon rescinded.The strength of the Braer Storm is believed to have helped dissipate the oil spill as the rough seas churned the crude oil ndash which was of a biodegradable form ndash into nothingness.The oil spill is now regraded as a ldquoclose shave, whose ecological damage could was been exponentially worse had it occurred in calmer seas or closer to the mainland.However, the size of the storm has been revealed by the Imperial College study on St Kilda, which lies  miles to the the southwest of Shetland, on the other side of the British Isles.The rural island is one of the the remotest places in Scotland and is about  mileswest of North Uist, the nearest inhabited place to the archipelago in the Outer Hebrides.Its population of hardy Soay sheep is thought to have descended from animals which once lived on the island and have now gone feral, and is unique to St Kilda and its neighbour islands."},{"url":null,"title":"virtual-voyages-capture-scottish-coast-part-tourism-campaign","story":"The countryrsquos coastline and islands have been captured in  degree virtual reality

There will be a lot of fiscal give and take between Scotland and the rest of the UK over assets and liabilities.But Scotland would have to show that it is capable of harnessing its currency to the euro, evenit doesnrsquot actually join it. Currency autonomy might be hard to establish , as in the Scottish Governmentrsquos scenario, Scotland keeps using the pound for a decade after independence.: In post-Brexit Britain, Nicola Sturgeon cant keep telling her troops that Indyref is round the corner. It isntIf a nominally independent Scotland were still subject to interest rates operating in a country that is outside the European Union, that would be a dficult sell. The EU is very good at finding novel ways to get round problems like this. But it might take a few years.There may be a trade deal on regulations between the UK and the EU that solves some of Scotlandrsquos accession and border problems. We just donrsquot know. This is one of the imponderables of Scottish independence. It is actually very dficult to make a clear prospectus for indyref when we donrsquot yet know how the UK is going to stand in relation to the EU.But there is a bigger question than all of these: would Scotland necessarily want to rejoin the European Union  Nicola Sturgeon takes it as read, but there would be a debate at the very least. Around a million Scots voted for Brexit and many of them were supporters of independence.Brussels has had some bad press in the last decade. Austerity policies were imposed after  which were worse than in the UK and caused problems across the Mediterranean states. Its behaviour toward Greece during the sovereign debt crisis would have shamed the British Empire at its worst.Brussels stood idly by while one member state, Spain, imposed draconian repression in Catalonia, breaking heads and locking up elected politicians. There was scarcely a word from Brussels, let alone sanctions. Then there is fish.Many in the independence movement believe the EU is a neoliberal club ndash which it is ndash and would be happier with an arrangement like Norwayrsquos which has control of fishing grounds, is not subject to EU rules and has a managed economy. The case for a referendum before Scotland rejoined the EU would seem to me to be unanswerable.At the very least, the SNP could not take it for granted. Unionists will continue to argue that it makes little economic sense for Scotland to leave the Union with the UK, which is where the majority of Scottish exports go. There would be a hard border, currency controls, possibly tarfs.Ms Sturgeonrsquos problem is that the very arguments the SNP used against leaving the European Union ndash freedom of movement, zero tarfs, regulatory harmony ndash apply equally to leaving the United Kingdom. Theyrsquoll come winging back. Aversion to Boris Johnson may not be enough to persuade Scots to take the biggest leap in  years.Read more: Sturgeon cant keep telling her troops that Indyref is round the corner"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-wind-up-merchant","story":"The recently announced sale of Babbity Bowster made reader Ian Watson realise how much hersquod miss the genial wit and charm of Fraser Laurie, the owner of Glasgows Merchant City pub.

That is true ndash and thatrsquos the trouble. Scottish independence means freeing ourselves from precisely this delusion of an essentially benign Britishness. It means acknowledging the fact that since its creation by massive bribery and corruption in , the British state has been congenitally and irredeemably, an imperialist construct. The problem is that Scotland has a schizoid identity. We were on the one hand, the perpetrators of imperialism, while being at the same time its victims. Perhaps this lies at the root of Hugh MacDiarmidrsquos infamous ldquoCaledonian antisysygy.Mr Bone boasts that Scotland did well from this ldquoprecious Union. Indeed, a few did profit handsomely from Empire rich capitalists and servants of the state did nicely, thank you. But at what a cost. While the common men were far from home fighting for the imperial masters, their wives and children were being evicted from their homes and their houses burnt to the ground.The soldiers ed to poverty and destitution, and drted into the cities seeking a living. The empty landscape we regard today as beautul is a painful witness to past injustices, just as is the present grotesque ownership of vast swathes of our land by a handful of plutocratic landlords.But nostalgia for imperialism is still a very potent element in political le. Mr Bonersquos letter is powerful proof of this.Brian M Quail, Glasgow G.MARK SMITHwrites that many Scots ldquowant to stay the same ndash British ndash within a changed system, and then argues that the change needed is toward ldquoa federal system based on proportional representation [meaning] less chance of a Tory government at Westminster and so, by extension, less dference with Scotland.There are two major errors in this. First, in  the British electorate rejected the Alternative Vote , about the simplest method of PR there is. Only the Liberal Democrats, SNP, Plaid Cymru and most of the Green Party were in favour, while the Conservatives were resolutely against and Labour ndash perhaps an indication of things to come ndash adopted no official position. The UK vote to reject was almost  per cent, with England voting  per cent against and Scotland  per cent.Secondly, it is all very well to speak of federalism but just how would it be introduced  For instance, what relative powers would continue to be held at UK level  Just how centralised would it be  Westminster with a few ldquoparish councils  And how many ldquoparish councils A federal UK would be composed of four members, one of whichis almost  per cent of the whole by population. Of course, perhaps England would be happy to balkanise itself to create a more equal structure though even then, London and the south-eastwould alone constitute  per cent of the population, as well as being economically way ahead of everyone . And does anyone really believe Boris Johnson would introduce a system with ldquoless chance of a Tory government A federal UK, therefore, would pose its own issues, and in any event, given the short shrt AV got, implementing federalism may be a solution to something they might not even consider a problem.Therefore, the most egregious error in Mr Smithrsquos thinking is that while he sees the aim of a federal system to be ldquoless dference with Scotland, perhaps the view at Westminster is that it is Scotland that needs to change so that there is less dference between us and the rest of the UK Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.OWEN Kellydoes not appear to have high hopes for the pending visits to Scotland by Boris Johnson.I confess to having some sympathy with the challenge to re-establish the Tory Party in Scotland which Boris faces. He has to manoeuvre past the still-dark shadows cast by people like Michael Forsyth, Malcolm Rkind and Ian Lang. I cannot help but visualise them having afternoon tea with Jacob Rees-Mogg.Many people will rightly see the success of the SNP in Scotland as people simply voting for the least unappealing of the political parties on offer rather than a sympathy vote for independence. Most obviously, I expect very many SNP voters are really lapsed Labour voters who are still bewildered by the swings between the New Labour of Tony Blair and the failed far left Labour of Jeremy Corbyn.I anticipate that Mr Johnson may well be received better in Scotland than might be imagined. His colourful and rather eccentric persona will be a welcome antidote to the phlegmatic, dour and humourless characters who front the tiresome and boring SNP mantra calling for Indyref.Bill Brown, Milngavie.I NOTE to your report headed \"Johnson plans more visits to Scotland to help strengthen the Union\" .Last September, Boris Johnson gave himself the new title: Minister for the Union.This new Ministry for the Union solemnly announced in its spending package: \"pound million of additional funding to strengthen the links between the four nations of the union as the UK leaves the EU, supporting the work of the prime minister as minister for the union. Of this, pound million will be allocated to the Territorial Offices.\"Amazingly, \"Territorial Offices\" is the actual UK Government official term for the Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Office of the Secretary of State for Wales and the Northern Ireland Office. So Scotland is one of the UK \"territories\", just like the British Virgin Islands or Gibraltar.Mr Johnsons first act as Minister for the Union will be to place the \"Territory\" of Scotland on a new international customs frontier running from Islay, via Campbeltown and the Firth of Clyde to Stranraer.While Whitehall is spending pound million to save the Union, it has committed pound. billion to planning for a no-deal Brexit.Councillor Tom Johnston , Cumbernauld.IT is clear that Boris Johnson is indeed a \"One Nation\" Conservative. With the refusal of consent for the EU Withdrawal Agreement by governments in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, that one nation, it appears, is England.Alex Orr, Edinburgh EH.THE International Monetary Fundhas predicted that the British economy will grow faster than that of the Eurozone over the next two years. Where does this leave the SNPs desire to abandon the UK in favour of the EU  The IMF is a highly respected international body and this report cannot simply be brushed aside by SNP spin and Derek Mackays re-imagined GERS figures.Nicola Sturgeon is always praising EU membership over the current Union as being in Scotlands best interests, particularly financial. This report shows the race for Scotlands bright future is firmly within the Union, not the EU. The SNP is backing the wrong horse.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.I READ Alan Fitzpatricks letterregarding possible reduced care home charges, and appreciate the concerns that he raises.However, I think that the bigger problem would be that it would discourage people from coming to Scotland in the first place.Unless they are fabulously wealthy, I doubtmany pensioners living in Scotland would move to England. Obviously, I can only speak for my septuagenarian self, butI were to move, where would I settle  I still have friends in England from school, university and Army days, but they are scattered all over. I would also have to buy a new house, and in several parts of England, that would be very expensive. Add to that the cost of surveys, removal, solicitors and estate agents fees, and any alterations needed to make the new house into a new home, and any tax savings would rapidly melt away, evenI were to continue to work.Even more importantly, I would lose, and need to rebuild the networks that I have built up over -plus years ndash church, the football club that I support, friends and neighbours, the societies and associations to which I belong and which have shared my joys and supported me in times of distress, as well as visits to and from my grandchildren and their families. The sort of things that money just cannot buy. All this may well be replaced by grumpy neighbours, who might assume that I had arrived in their community simply to sponge off their social security system.So, Scotland: all being well, youre stuck with me ndash English, pro-Union and pro-Brexit ndash hopefully for a long time to come.Christopher W Ide, Waterfoot.YOUR Those Were The Days feature todaybrought back memories of the early s campaign for a Scottish legislature.

Rationing also generated thousands of enquiries, and bureaux persuaded the government to grant extra clothes coupons to pregnant women. The first CABs in  were in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Stirling and Dundee.Post-war period: Against expectations, the end of the war brought an increased demand. CABs dealt with more enquiries than at the height of the blitz. Housing problems and family breakdowns increased. To meet this demand, the number of CABs began to prolerate.The advent of Legal Aid and the NHS led to a surge in enquiries.s: Housing problems continued to grow as people struggled with the housing shortage, overcrowding, and the end of rent controls.Hire purchase promised le on the ‘never-never.’ For many this led to mounting debts.s: Rents were rocketing, yet many people were still living in slum conditions and homelessness was rising. By  housing problems accounted for a quarter of the . million problems dealt with by CABs across the UK.Divorce reform too led to a surge in enquiries, with family problems representing  per cent of the CAB workload.s: Family, housing and benefit problems remained the top priority, but the consumer boom saw personal debt soar too. Industrial change saw an increase in redundancies and workers’ rights issues.s: Consumerism brought with it two recessions and debt and benefit cases doubled. Employment enquiries rose by  per cent. But debt, stemming from easy credit, became the biggest CAB issue.s: Social security became the top issue and sharp rises in VAT didn’t help.

I think I finally wore him out!”Sharon was tasked with cleaning out cages, the floors and vans.“They gave me all the dirty jobs to try put me off, but it didn’t work,” she said.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Patron Princess Anne helped Citizens Advice Scotland celebrate its th year by spending three hours chatting to the many volunteers who form the bedrock of the charitys work.\"  Citizens Advice has been helping people in Scotland since viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Heros welcome...family and friends met Mark Calder at the Forth Bridges to celebrate his achievement, on the final leg of his mammoth Running Home  challenge.\"  Scottish charity worker surpasses his £, Running Home target viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"A year later, she worked at the centre every weekend and during the school holidays, earning her first wage of £ per fortnight in February .She has remained with the SSPCA ever since, albeit moving up the ranks!But Sharon never ever wanted to become an inspector for her the job was all about working with the animals in their care.She said: “I’ve always had a love and passion for animals but didn’t just want to have a pet I wanted to work with and help look after them.“Originally, I thought of becoming a vet but when you start having boyfriends, that goes out the window!“I already had a job with the SSPCA which I loved anyway so I just decided to work there instead.“I never wanted to be an inspector, though, because to me the best bit of the job is helping animals that come in to us and then seeing them rehomed. “That to me has always been more fulfilling than dealing with what the inspectors have to tackle.“They don’t have much contact with the animals once they take them to the centres so that was never going to be my job.”After leaving school, Sharon became a kennel maid at the Rosebank Centre.In , she became the manager and three years later she oversaw the move to bigger premises at Petterden where she remained at the helm until .She then moved to the SSPCA’s HQ in Dunfermline as the superintendent.She now oversees all the centres across Scotland which, while involving a lot of paperwork and staffing issues, still enables her to build relationships with the animals in their care.For it is a love of animals that has led Sharonto devote the last  years to the SSPCA – and she plans to continue for a few years yet.She joked: “I’ve told my husband David that I’m going to retire in three years’ time, once I’ve worked with the SSPCA for  years. If I get to  that will be it. “ButI still have my health, I might just carry on for another few years...”It’s clear that leaving the SSPCA would be a huge wrench for Sharon so I wouldn’t put bets on her leaving in three years!During her time with the society, Sharon and David have had two boys, Ronnieand Greg . They also have a grandson, Ronnie jnr who is now .But Sharon also brought her work home with her and the couple are now also “mum and dad” to three dogs, two of which Sharon hand-reared, and three cats.“There’s always one or two that pull at your heart-strings,” she said, by way of explanation for their very own menagerie!However, there’s one dog which she didn’t adopt which also brings a tear to her eye.“A wee puppy came in with PAVO virus whom we called Paddy,” she recalled.“He was a wee black and white lurcher type who was at death’s door.“I stayed in the kennels with him for three or four nights and, at one point, he did actually die.“We resuscitated him though and after about eight weeks we got him back on his feet and rehomed.“Seven years later, I was doing my shopping in Dundee when I heard this commotion.“This dog squeezed itself out of a passenger window, ran across the road and jumped right into my arms.“It was Paddy the police officer who rehomed him was on the opposite side of the street from me but the dog saw me, remembered me and was determined to come and say hello.“It was amazing that he remembered me after all that time – they don’t forget the kindness you show them.“A lot of the animals we care for are more than happy to come back for visits with us. They realise its a sanctuary for them so they are more than happy to come back and say hello.“I’ll always remember that day with Paddy though in . He’s now long gone but I’ll never forget him.”Sharon has witnessed many changes over the years and longs for the day when people finally stop being cruel to their animals.However, she knows that, until that day, the SSPCA will be there to help them.She added: “Behind every animal, there’s a human story too.“The biggest problem, other than cruelty cases, that we see is people with mental health issues.“They love their animals but maybe start with a pregnant cat, keep all the kittens and then end up with  or  in their home.“They can’t bear to be parted with them and end up in a dficult situation.“It’s heart-breaking to hear some of those human stories but, at the end of the day, we are here to look after the animals.“Over the years, I’ve seen thousands and thousands of animals who have been nursed back to good health and rehomed.“I’m really, really lucky. Not many people can say they’ve worked in their dream job for  years but I still wake up every day and feel blessed.”SSPCA could not operate without generosity of the publicToday, the SSPCA has nine animal rescue and rehoming centres and a world-leading wildle rescue centre at Fishcross in Clackmannanshire.The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work. The public funds the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team at its centres across Scotland and its wildle sanctuary. The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children through its educational programmes.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.To find out more or donate, visit www.scottishspca.org."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish charity worker surpasses his 50 000 running home target","story":"Even Mark Calder wasn#t surehe#d be able to pull off his mammoth  challenge. In January last year, we featured his incredible aim to run  ultramarathons along some of Scotland’s ancient pilgrim routes.The Running Home  challenge combined his two passions – running and his work with charity Embrace the Middle East, for which he is regional manager for Scotland and the north of England.He hoped to raise £, to rebuild war-torn areas of Iraq while covering the  miles, gathering support and funds along the way.While there were times when Mark didn’t think he’d see the finish line, he successfully completed the challenge.He also surpassed his fundraising tally – with £, currently banked.And he’s hopeful that even more funds will be amassed before he travels to Iraq this spring to see it put to good use.Marksaid: “There were occasions when I wanted to go home.“I knew,I was to quit, I was going home to a nice, comfortable house. The people I was running for don’t have that option.“That was a monumental reason to keep going.”Mark had extraordinary support along the way, not least from his crew – Gareth Brocklebank and Andrew Clarke – who followed him in a camper van, which also acted as shelter in areas where overnight BB stays were not an option.Mark’s we Karen and his two daughters also cheered him every step of the way as did many strangers.“People welcomed me into their churches and communities and generously donated large sums of money,” he said.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.hawick-news webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Hands-on...Superintendent Sharon Comriehas worked for the SSPCA for an incredible  years.

I was feeling great but, within ten minutes, a niggle turned into barely being able to walk.“I had to find a couple of sticks from the woods to use as shin splints.”However, it was an earlier, shorter run – St Cuthbert’s in March – which cost Mark a full day and also taught him a very valuable lesson.“I wanted to run from Melrose to Lindisfarne, where I planned to stay overnight, but I had to be there for a certain time due to the tide restrictions.“I got lost early on and was chasing my tail for the rest of the day. I started pushing really hard and ended up lost in the hills for  minutes, with no water, torchlight or phone charge.“I rushed checkpoints and didn’t take the time to check my kit properly.“I was dehydrated, didn’t stay on Lindisfarne and lost a whole day because of it.“It taught me a very good lesson – that I couldn’t do it alone and that these runs were pilgrimages, not races.“I had my tail between my legs the next couple of days but the reception at Durham Cathedral reminded me of what I was doing and why.”Mark enjoyed a similar reception at the Forth Bridges, where supporters and family joined forces to cheer him on before he reached the finish line in St Andrews on November .The following day, he addressed parishioners in St Leonard’s Church.It was the perfect place to end Running Home as St Andrews was once such a centre of pilgrimage.Mark took a breather to enjoy Christmas and New Year but has a busy  planned.He added: “I’m heading to Iraq in the spring to see how the money is being spent.“I also plan to revisit some of the places and people I met this year, by car though!“I passed through a lot of villages that were torched in the Highland Clearances.“People were forced out of their homes, and in some cases country, so there’s a sense of solidarity there with today’s refugees.“I was conscious of not being able to spend much time in places where I got a great deal of support.“So I’m hoping to revisit some of those communities, combining storytelling and traditional folk music to consolidate the friendships I made this year.”Karen is not keen for Mark to pull his running shoes back on too soon, but he will be taking on the York Marathon in October.

While the Government continues to dither, local people will feel the impact as we move from being rule makers to rule takers.“Last week I spoke in the house about the risks that new tarfs and trade barriers could have for businesses in the Northern Isles. Food and drink production are a staple part of the isles economy. The impact that continued and intensied tarfs could have on rural communities is signicant and organisations such as the SWA are understandably concerned.“This could be just a taste of what is to come as we leave the EU and our economic clout is reduced. If there were any doubt about the limits of our leverage in future trade negotiations with the US, this is a reminder of the precarious position that the Government is putting us in.“I will be writing to the Secretary of State for International Trade to explain what efforts they are making on these tarfs as a matter of urgency. With the UK losing our seat at the table in these trade talks at the end of this month, the next two weeks are crucial. We must give a voice to our local producers in these trade talks while we still can.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

HIAL has also said there are no planned reductions in staff numbers as a result of the project.The union representing staff at the airports, Prospect, says the proposals are #poorly thought-through, have not been consulted on, and will put the long-term future of vital services at risk.The union has said the plans could take £.m of direct employment away from rural and island economies.Further proposals would also see a review of air traffic services at At Benbecula and Wick John O’Groats, with a new system put in place there, which Prospect says would likely result in a further ten redundancies.HIAL managing director Inglis Lyon, said: “The strategic programme decisions made by the Board will move us into the implementation phase of the project and allow detailed operational decisions to be made. “The acquisition of a base for the new Combined Surveillance Centre marks a signicant next step in the project.“It will allow us to move forward with planning and procurement of the relevant systems to safely deliver a state of the art air traffic control management system and give additional clarity to colleagues and stakeholders as we deliver this complex and challenging programme.“Our focus continues to be on aviation service delivery and providing a safe, modern and efficient means of handling aircraft for the regions and the islands in the future.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There will be a particular interest in initiatives that link maths or computer science to real-world problems or inspire a erse range of students to engage with these subjects.Adam Lang, head of Nesta in Scotland, said: “Teachers across Scotland are doing an amazing job of inspiring our young people to engage with learning and we want to champion those taking innovative and creative approaches.“Young people today need to be prepared for a society and a world of work that is changing rapidly. Being able to think creatively and solve problems are essential skills that will help our young people to succeed now and in the future.“In an increasingly tech-driven society, maths, science and computing will be ever-more important, as will the ability to adapt and apply these disciplines creatively to the challenges we will face in the future.

While HIAL has gone through the motions of consulting, having clearly failed to take on board any of the concerns raised, it is dficult to see what purpose this has served.“Since the announcement last week, I have been in discussions with local ATC staff who feel badly let down by HIAL.  Nobody disputes the need for modernisation, but even HIAL’s own consultants concluded that the remote tower model was the most costly and risky option. Alternatives were identied that could have delivered the improvements needed at a fraction of the cost.“While I welcome that HIAL is to carry out an island impact assessment, given its approach to consultation so far, there have to be questions over how robust or independent this assessment will be.#In the meantime, ministers must wake up to the scale of opposition and dissatisfaction amongst HIAL’s ATC staff. They should also recognise the clear threat this poses to delivery of leline air services in Orkney and across the Highlands  Islandsstaff choose to vote with their feet. That alone should give Ministers pause for thought and allow more time for alternative options to be explored”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Many of those are jobs for the th and th centuries, not the st.He said there is a gap between ldquothe future of work and the aspirations of young people, adding that ldquoaspirations havenrsquot changed in  years.Mr Schleicher told journalists that in the UK, gender and social stereotypes still play a part in young peoplersquos career aspirations, but no more so than in other countries. The report found that, for example, among boys and girls who perform similarly in science, in many countries the boys are more likely to expect to work in science and engineering.UK students do have a level of career exposure, Mr Schleicher said, such as opportunities for internships and job shadowing, but there are ldquomany interesting future-oriented jobs that British students are not seeing, particularly disadvantaged kids, and you canrsquot be what you canrsquot see.He also said that in general, ldquothe most important decisions about future careers are made in primary school. Thatrsquos where you make up your mind about whether school is important to you.He said primary school children need exposure to a wide range of careers to show them the options available, for example through workers going into schools to speak about their jobs.ldquoMy concern is we are closing too many doors too early in the lives of pupils, he added.A separate report published on Wednesday also finds a disconnect between young peoplersquos career dreams and UK jobs.The study by Education and Employers focused on the UK, and found that young people generally aspire to work in dferent industries to the ones where jobs are available.For example, five times as many youngsters want to work in the arts, culture, entertainment and sports industries as there are jobs available.It also concluded that childrenrsquos job aspirations are set as young as seven, and do not change enough as they grow up to meet job demand.copy -.

When it was announced a fortnight ago that the Chancellor would deliver his Budget for the UK on  March, Scottish Finance Secretary Derek Mackay slammed the move as “really disrespectful to devolution”, going on to say that there would be “profound consequences”.Just a few days later, Mr Mackay decided to do the sensible thing and go ahead and produce a Budget for Scotland anyway, assisted by information provided by the UK Treasury. It is worth remembering that the Welsh Government, despite suffering similar challenges, produced their own draft budget back in December, which puts into perspective the faux outrage from the SNP.: Mackay warns devolution “must be respected” in budget row: Don’t raise taxes and we’ll pass your budget, Tories tell SNPWhat we do know about the forthcoming Scottish Budget is that the Finance Secretary is likely to have at his disposal the highest sum in a decade, thanks to Barnett consequentials of at least £. billion, deriving from increased spending in areas such as health and education already announced by the UK Government. Against this backdrop, there can be no justication for any additional tax rises, or further cuts to vital public services.Business rates not fit for purposeIn recent years, we have seen the SNP do a deal with the Greens to deliver a growing tax gap between what iniduals pay in income tax in Scotland compared with the rest of the UK. Anyone earning more than £, a year, hardly a group of wealthy iniduals, will pay more income tax than their counterparts in England, and there is increasing concern in the business community about the perception that Scotland is the highest taxed part of the UK.Scottish Conservatives set out at the weekend our ‘asks’ for the Budget. We are clear in our ambition to see the tax gap reduced, and at least no more ergence in tax rates. And, specically, there should be no clawback of the promised National Insurance cut by the UK Government, through higher income tax rates set in Scotland.The second key measure we propose to help economic growth is to tackle business rates. It is our view that the current system of rates is no longer fit for purpose, and in need of comprehensive reform. In the short term, and as a minimum, the Large Business Supplement needs to be reduced to the same rate payable in the rest of the UK. Retailers in particular have borne the brunt of these high additional rates, with a devastating impact on traditional shopping centres. And all existing rates reliefs need to be protected.In relation to spending priorities, we want to see all Barnett consequentials arising from NHS spending in England passed on to the health service in Scotland, and funds utilised to end the underfunding of NHS boards, provide a hospital parking charges refund scheme, and restore the number of drug rehab beds, which have been cut by  per cent since .Hard-working familiesIn recent years, local government has borne the brunt of SNP cuts, with a substantial impact on council services. As a minimum, the core funding for local government needs to be increased at least in line with inflation, and all new or additional commitments fully funded from the centre.One other vital public service feeling the squeeze is the police, where the Chief Constable Ian Livingstone recently highlighted his concern about underfunding threatening the number of police officers. As a minimum we want to see an additional £m in the coming year to protect  police officer roles.All these measures, together with additional support for higher education, and an expansion in the Ending Homelessness Together fund, represent a package to support frontline public services, whilst not penalising hard-working Scottish families with additional taxes. At a time when the overall sums available are growing, they are all affordable. When it comes to the Budget negotiations in Holyrood, the Finance Secretary will have a simple choice.He can either reach a deal once again with the Scottish Green Party, who in the past have demanded even higher taxes, were the authors of the hated car park tax, and now are proposing stopping vital road safety improvements. Or, he can come and talk to the Scottish Conservatives about putting together a Budget that will support economic growth, and give our public services the investment they need. I hope that he and his SNP colleagues will be prepared to work with us on delivering a Budget that takes Scotland forward, not back.Murdo Fraser is a Scottish Conservative MSP for Mid Scotland and Fe©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"council to carry out churchyard safety check ","story":"Unsafe memorial sign.Surely a #This memorial has FAILED# # notice should be red  Bairns who may not be of reading age, but who know about traffic lights, and those who left their specs at home, will very likely think a green notice means the structure is sound.Unless they#re colour blind.

This programme is about far more than that as Club Chairman Jim Brady elaborates: “Our annual programme places its emphasis clearly on the achievement of personal goals for all involved. “For some that might be simply getting out of the house for an activity at a time of the year when the long nights and inclement weather may put you off leaving home. “For others it may be an opportunity to meet new people, to try something new or indeed … to lose some weight.“Whatever the goal, the programme seems to have captured the imagination of local people in great numbers since it started four years ago with some  people in total taking part. “As well as providing the participants with a range of activities to undertake we offer mental wellness sessions, a range of social events to attend and many opportunities to step outside of their comfort zone. “All of our fitness tutors are locally based and that means that as well as channelling funding towards them during the programme they also get a chance to show off their product and attract spin-off business as a result throughout the remainder of the year”.In  the programme was recognised at the Irish News Club  Volunteer Awards when it was awarded the prestigious award for best Club Health  Well Being initiative.

This is a matter of concern.”It added that the findings suggest that “increasingly the expectations of young people may be out of date and unrealistic”.Traditional roles such as doctor, teacher, vet, engineer and police officer continue to be popular with young people, it said.Mr Schleicher said “Almost half of -year-olds aspire to just  jobs in a very fast-changing world of work. Many of those are jobs for the th and th centuries, not the st.He said there is a gap between “the future of work and the aspirations of young people”, adding that “aspirations haven’t changed in  years”.Mr Schleicher told journalists that in the UK, gender and social stereotypes still play a part in young people’s career aspirations, but no more so than in other countries.The most important decisions about future careers are made in primary schoolAndreas SchleicherThe report found that, for example, among boys and girls who perform similarly in science, in many countries the boys are more likely to expect to work in science and engineering.UK students do have a level of career exposure, Mr Schleicher said, such as opportunities for internships and job shadowing, but there are “many interesting future-oriented jobs that British students are not seeing, particularly disadvantaged kids, and you can’t be what you can’t see”.He also said that in general, “the most important decisions about future careers are made in primary school. That’s where you make up your mind about whether school is important to you”.He said primary school children need exposure to a wide range of careers to show them the options available, for example through workers going into schools to speak about their jobs.“My concern is we are closing too many doors too early in the lives of pupils,” he added.A separate report published on Wednesday also finds a disconnect between young people’s career dreams and UK jobs.The study by Education and Employers focused on the UK, and found that young people generally aspire to work in dferent industries to the ones where jobs are available.For example, five times as many youngsters want to work in the arts, culture, entertainment and sports industries as there are jobs available.It also concluded that children’s job aspirations are set as young as seven, and do not change enough as they grow up to meet job demand."},{"url":null,"title":"emu startles staff at australia airport","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

More than  cases of the newly identied coronavirus have been confirmed in China, most of them in Wuhan, according to the World Health Organisation.The count includes six deaths — all in China, most of them age  or older, including at least some who had a previous medical condition.Officials have said it probably spread from animals to people, but this week Chinese officials said they have concluded it also can spread from person to person.Health authorities this month identied the germ behind the outbreak as a new type of coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which cause the common cold others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.Sars, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, belongs to the coronavirus family, but Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is dferent from coronaviruses that have been identied in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out Sars and Mers — Middle East respiratory syndrome — as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common lung-infecting germs.The new virus so far does not appear to be as deadly as Sars and Mers, but viruses can sometimes mutate to become more dangerous.University of Washington coronavirus researcher David Veesler said the public “should not be panicking right now”.The response has been “very efficient,” he said. “In a couple of weeks, China was able to identy the virus, isolate it, sequence it and share that information.”He added: “We don’t have enough data to judge how severe the disease is.”The CDC’s Dr Nancy Messonnier said health officials expected to see more cases in the US and around the world in the coming days."},{"url":null,"title":"510412","story":"Sinn Feacutein Benbradagh councillor Brenda Chivers has welcomed news planning permission for additional five classrooms has been approved for Limavadys Rossmar School.After intensive lobbying by my colleagues for the replacement of what was really a not fit for purpose facility, that was nearly seventy years old, the then Sinn Feacutein Education Minister John O Dowd approved the new school estate costing some pound. million pounds, a move that was most welcome from the Rossmar community, including pupils, staff, Board of Governors and the wider Limavady and district area, work which is currently ongoing and should be due for completion in the very near future.This new addition to the school will future proof the entire site and ensure its efficacy for the decades to come.

John Dallats introduction to politics came quite by chance.An invitation to join a new branch of the SDLP was sent to his brother, but John went instead and almost got selected to run for council.He declined, pleading that he was living and teaching in Donegal.Four years later, after ing to Kilrea to take up a teaching post at St Paul’s College, he was chosen to run and so began a letime of council work which culminated in John becoming the first ever nationalist mayor in Coleraine.This period also represented his involvement in rejuvenating the local Credit Union which was in danger of closingA new Conference of Saint Vincent de Paulwas also being set up in Kilrea which would do amazing things for people.Around the same time, the man who was about to become one of Ulsters most hated sectarian killers, was placed by the Probation Service in the very town John lived, and worked in.Just before committing the Castlerock and Greysteel atrocities, UFF murdererTorrens Knight was placed on a local community employment scheme in Kilrea.He left without completing the year of work he was ordered to do by the courts.“The rest is, of course history,” said John. “He and his cronies murdered my friend Gerry Dalrymple, who was in my house the night before the Castlerock murder of four workmen.“His last advice to me was to pull my curtains.“The following morning, he was dead and so too were three of his workmates.“These were dark and dangerous times with armed cops sitting outside the council chamber.“In the beginning I thought they were protecting unionists but when I complained that they could be better used other places I was told by the Divisional Commander it was me they were looking after because I had no control over my mouth!“Yes, Ulster Resistance had brought in guns which were ided among the UDA and UVF and in the future innocent people would die at Castlerock, Greysteel and where.“Among those in the security forces to die was Bertie Gilmore who lived in the same lane as me.“We played together, grew up together and Bertie joined the UDR and I the SDLP. googletag.cmd.push  John Dallat ready for the road in his beloved Morris Minor car. Photo: Mary K Burke “He had retired three years and was recovering from a severe heart attack when he and his we were riddled with gunfire beside the retirement site he was going to build.“Today his daughter is among those who have helped me in challenging times.”Johnwas born and bred in Rasharkin, Co Antrim.“On reflectionI was asked to be born into a dferent house in a dferent place I would turn it down.“I was happy growing up by a Tilley Lamp, carrying water from the well and waking up in the morning with ice on the inside of the windows.“Later on I loved the ‘put-put’ of our ‘Start-o-matic’ generator and Peeke my pet pigeon was never from my side.“She had fallen out of the nest and my mother nursed her back to le while she grew the most beautul brown and white feathers.“An amazing creature of God. I knew why we couldn’t get a council house and I know it was more than just because we were Catholics. “Poor Protestants didn’t get council houses either because they might also be unable to pay the council rent.“Anyway, we kept a goat for the milk which was good for my wee brother Gerard who was special needs both physically and mentally.“He died when he was  and part of my mother and father died too.”John said that being the “underdog” was second nature to him growing up.And it was something he carried with him into his politics career.“It just seemed right and at times didn’t go down well, especially when I sided with the travellers when they came to town but the travellers were good people and attitudes changed,” he said.“When a young girl from a dferent part of the world suffered horric le-changing injuries after losing her job and was left homeless, it seemed right to have her for Christmas in our home and it was one of our best and happiest times ever.“Today she and her family are our best friends and we love them to bits.“When an African student was going to be deported because her visa ran out and her sponsor died suddenly it seemed only right to bring her home and set about stopping her going back to a country where she had only a blind grandmother and no one .“Luck had it I met the head of the Border Agency in Stormont on the corridor and he extended her stay for two years.“In the meantime, she met an amazing husband, married and is among our best friends.“Brian Kennedy played at the wedding and we dressed up in African traditional dress!There is one battle, not yet won, which has had the most impact on John in his role as a public representative.He said: “Perhaps the one story which doesn’t have a good ending just yet is the dreadful murder of Inga-Maria Hauser whose mutilated body was found in Ballypatrick Forest  days after her neck was broken in an attempted rape.“Early next year I will meet her only sister Frederika at a special conference in Queen’s University.“That will be an amazing occasion and hopefully the prelude to her murderer being brought before the courts for one of the most brutal killings I have ever read about.”At the heart of it all has been one thing, John’s family.“Politics had its mixed blessings. I got to see places in the world that I could never have been but it also brought its problems – searching under the car for booby traps, bullet-proof windows and doors and a gun that I know I would never have used.“But politics also gave me the most incredible family.“My poor we Anne was parachuted into the north at the height of the Troubles to a small town which was bombed from one end to the other.“Our daughter, Helena, now a councillor, became the youngest detainee when we were arrested by the British army in Derry shortly after crossing the border.“She was ten days old and our mission was simply showing her off to her Donegal grandparents.“Sixteen years later as a member of the Foyle Harp School she played for President Bill Clinton when he first made that history-making appearance in Mackey’s Foundry.“Later, she would entertain other leaders including President Robinson and McAleese as well as John Major and member of the Royal Family.“I felt honoured when she was invited to play in the Russian Embassy in Washington on Saint Patrick’s Day.“Today the same harp is never out of sight but not played in public anymore.”John added: “Our two sons, Ronan and Diarmuid have been amazing and in one dficult and dangerous year we were on the Aran Islands three times for our safety.“For  years Inishmore, the largest of the three Aran Islands has been our refuge, our safety valve and our friend.“Two weeks ago when I was in hospital after breaking my arm while canvassing, Vincent Mc Carron, one of our friends, left the island during a storm, drove to Kilrea to collect Anne, go to Derry to collect me from hospital and bring me home. He stayed for several days helping with my recovery.”In , one week after his mother sadly passed away, John became Deputy Speaker, a post he held for ten years.“I found it a strange place and certainly not reflecting my background where the term ’Mister’ was hardly order of the day.“In time I persuaded the doorkeepers and others to call me by my first name and I felt comfortable about that.“I felt I was dismantling a bit of the old Stormont that was in danger of being rejuvenated!“All these people were my friends by simply showing them a bit of respect, nothing more and I have missed them dearly over the last three years when I see little of them anymore.”Reflecting on challenges and achievements in his political career, Mr Dallat spoke about stopping the closure or the Belfast-Derry railway north of Ballymena.”The twenty-year project nearly went off the rails several times,” he said.“The Civil Service had a plan to save money by closing the railway north of Ballymena and use the savings to make a start on the A roadway though Toome.“Today the Belfast-Derry railway carries many more passengers than the Belfast-Dublin Enterprise service, but still needs connected to the Irish Rail network and that is a priority for me.John added: “Stopping the closure of the Irish Coastguard Radio Station at Malin Head, announced by Leo Varadkar when he was Minister for Transport.“I gave evidence to a Dail committee with two of my councillors and told the TD’s this was one of the best examples of cross-border bodies, seamless, transcending partition and two world wars, costing very little and actually working! Varadkar had to back down.”As vice-chair of the Public Accounts Committee I exposed wanton waste of public money and brought about important changes which the civil service didn’t like.“Effort to cover up who was responsible for bad mistakes and neglect were strenuously resisted.“Later I was invited to Georgia and Armenia to share my experiences and I felt so honoured and privileged.“I just couldn’t believe that a boy that grew up in a house with no electricity, no running water could be involved in helping democracy grow in two of Russia’s former territories.”With the Assembly back up and running, John says he has great hope for the future.“I have been through the best and the worst of times and see an amazing future for this part of Ireland.“I see wonderful people all around me in both communities and I want to be part of that community for the sake of future generations that will create a new Ireland and one we can all celebrate.“I would encourage every young person to do likewise.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But with our lives being so busy we often forget the simple activities bring the happiest times and memories. As parents, and childminders too, we can also feel under pressure to always be teaching our children, so this week I’ve combined these two themes, baking and learning. The curriculum for our young children talks about three prime areas of learningand these are Personal, Social andEmotional Development - this is all about learning to share, to wait, taking an interest and participating in activities, being responsible for tasks, having opportunity to feel valued and able to contribute, talking about what you are doing together, asking questions and having a special bond etc. googletag.cmd.push Communication and Language - this is about listening, paying attention, being able to focus and concentrate, being able to follow instructions, naming dferent items and actions, speaking in sentences, asking and answering questions, having a two way conversation etc Physical Development - is about small finger movements and large movements too, it’s about being able to use and control items, objects and tools etc and also self care, personal hygiene, having own likes and dislikes, being safe and using equipment safely etc. If we consider these and look at all that baking involves we can see all the learning that is going on from collecting all ingredients, selecting and organising bowls, spoons, whisks etc, washing hands, putting on an apron, then reading instructions, following a receipe, talking about what next, weighing, counting, pouring, breaking, mixing, adding, stirring, smelling, washing implements, waiting for cakes to cook then cool before sharing and tasting! googletag.cmd.push  Recipes For You To Make Together Scones - g oz self raising flour, g oz butter, g oz caster sugar, ml fl oz milk, pinch of salt . Method Heat the oven to C F Gas . Lightly grease a baking sheet. Mix together the flour and salt and rub in the butter. Stir in the sugar and then the milk to make a dough. Put onto a lightly floured work topand knead. Roll out the dough to about cm thick and shape into scones. Brush the tops of the scones with a little milk. Bake for - minutes until well risen and golden. Then leave to cool on a wire rack and add whatever you like! If you want to add sultanas or choc chips before you bake then why not! Cheese Pancakes -   cup flour,  frac tsp baking powder,  frac tsp sugar,   tsp salt,  egg,  cupof grated cheddar cheese - too much cheese will make them too sloppy,  cup milk ,  tbsp melted butter. Method Mix together the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Stir the grated cheddar cheese into the flour mixture until everything is evenly combined. Beat together in a separate bowl the egg, milk and melted butter. Stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients just to moisten. Heat a lightly oiled frying pan over medium high heat. Spoon the batter onto the pan, using approximately   cup for each pancake. Cook till brown on both sides and enjoy! Cupcakes - g butter , it’s a good idea to get the butter out of the fridge much earlier so it is soft!,  large eggs, g caster sugar,g self raising flour . Method heat oven to C   F  Gas . Fill a cup cake tray with  cake cases. Whisk together butter, sugar then add beaten eggs bit at a time, whisking in between. Add vanilla extract and sieved flour then pop the mixture into the cake cases and into the oven for about  minutes. If you’d like to decorate with buttercream after they have cooled , then to make the butter cream mix together g butterand g icing sugarthen add  tbsp milk and food colouringyou like. You can use a spoon or fork to add the buttercream to the cupcakes or even use a piping bag! Biscuits… - p vanilla extract. Method Heat oven to C C F Gas  and line a baking tray with baking   greaseproof paper. Put the butter in a bowl and beat until soft and creamy. Beat in the sugar, then the egg and vanilla, and then the sieved flour to make a dough - knead. If the dough feels sticky, add a little bit more flour. Roll out to about   cm thickness and cut out shapes using a biscuit cutter or rim of a cup. If you feel adventurous then gently press some clean toys into the biscuit - car tracks, lego shapes etcor add sultanas to make a face! Then bake for - minutes before eating!

But with our lives being so busy we often forget the simple activities bring the happiest times and memories. As parents, and childminders too, we can also feel under pressure to always be teaching our children, so this week I’ve combined these two themes, baking and learning. The curriculum for our young children talks about three prime areas of learningand these are Personal, Social andEmotional Development - this is all about learning to share, to wait, taking an interest and participating in activities, being responsible for tasks, having opportunity to feel valued and able to contribute, talking about what you are doing together, asking questions and having a special bond etc. googletag.cmd.push Communication and Language - this is about listening, paying attention, being able to focus and concentrate, being able to follow instructions, naming dferent items and actions, speaking in sentences, asking and answering questions, having a two way conversation etc Physical Development - is about small finger movements and large movements too, it’s about being able to use and control items, objects and tools etc and also self care, personal hygiene, having own likes and dislikes, being safe and using equipment safely etc. If we consider these and look at all that baking involves we can see all the learning that is going on from collecting all ingredients, selecting and organising bowls, spoons, whisks etc, washing hands, putting on an apron, then reading instructions, following a receipe, talking about what next, weighing, counting, pouring, breaking, mixing, adding, stirring, smelling, washing implements, waiting for cakes to cook then cool before sharing and tasting! googletag.cmd.push  Recipes For You To Make Together Scones - g oz self raising flour, g oz butter, g oz caster sugar, ml fl oz milk, pinch of salt . Method Heat the oven to C F Gas . Lightly grease a baking sheet. Mix together the flour and salt and rub in the butter. Stir in the sugar and then the milk to make a dough. Put onto a lightly floured work topand knead. Roll out the dough to about cm thick and shape into scones. Brush the tops of the scones with a little milk. Bake for - minutes until well risen and golden. Then leave to cool on a wire rack and add whatever you like! If you want to add sultanas or choc chips before you bake then why not! Cheese Pancakes -   cup flour,  frac tsp baking powder,  frac tsp sugar,   tsp salt,  egg,  cupof grated cheddar cheese - too much cheese will make them too sloppy,  cup milk ,  tbsp melted butter. Method Mix together the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Stir the grated cheddar cheese into the flour mixture until everything is evenly combined. Beat together in a separate bowl the egg, milk and melted butter. Stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients just to moisten. Heat a lightly oiled frying pan over medium high heat. Spoon the batter onto the pan, using approximately   cup for each pancake. Cook till brown on both sides and enjoy! Cupcakes - g butter , it’s a good idea to get the butter out of the fridge much earlier so it is soft!,  large eggs, g caster sugar,g self raising flour . Method heat oven to C   F  Gas . Fill a cup cake tray with  cake cases. Whisk together butter, sugar then add beaten eggs bit at a time, whisking in between. Add vanilla extract and sieved flour then pop the mixture into the cake cases and into the oven for about  minutes. If you’d like to decorate with buttercream after they have cooled , then to make the butter cream mix together g butterand g icing sugarthen add  tbsp milk and food colouringyou like. You can use a spoon or fork to add the buttercream to the cupcakes or even use a piping bag! Biscuits… - p vanilla extract. Method Heat oven to C C F Gas  and line a baking tray with baking   greaseproof paper. Put the butter in a bowl and beat until soft and creamy. Beat in the sugar, then the egg and vanilla, and then the sieved flour to make a dough - knead. If the dough feels sticky, add a little bit more flour. Roll out to about   cm thickness and cut out shapes using a biscuit cutter or rim of a cup. If you feel adventurous then gently press some clean toys into the biscuit - car tracks, lego shapes etcor add sultanas to make a face! Then bake for - minutes before eating!

She was keen to help those in need and to get people involved.Making time for others, she had a listening ear and often offered advice in compassionate ways. She liked being at the heart of things, and she was the le and soul of the party.Helena, from the Crocknamohil Road close to Draperstown, went missing on November .She was last seen near the Foyle Bridge in Derry city.Her remains were discovered last Tuesday evening by search teams on the River Foyle, who had been scouring the area every day since her disappearance. Her family, including husband Declan and four children - Kayla, Ben, Kaeden andNiah-Rose - all aged from one to  years-old, had held out hope she wouldhome.On Monday morning they gathered with hundreds of others in a final farewell to the much loved daughter, sister, mum and we.Special recognition was given during the funeral mass from the McElhennon and McGlone families for the tireless, daily efforts by family, friends and strangers in looking for Helena.Passing on their thanks, Fr McGirr said: Over these past number of weeks Helena has been on the minds and in the prayers of countless people across our erse, good-hearted and generous community. Helena’s people also deeply appreciate the supportive messages from people conveyed across dferent s expressing their compassion and kindest thoughts.People were keen to help and pray for Helena. They have been opening their hearts and sharing their moments with a neighbour and people they’re feeling for. “They and the generosity of local businesses donating food for volunteers and family members also helped to draw Helena gently home.As sincere people and as a community of faith gathered here at St Patrick’s, we share our sympathy with everyone among Helena’s family and friends grieving her passing today. We also reach out to God to help and console us in our sorrow, and we pray to him for the happy repose of Helena’s soul in the le to come, because we would like her to have that peace very much.”Yesterday, messages of support continued to be posted on a Facebook page set up in the search for Helena.As well as offers of thoughts and prayers, messages lent support for her family and expressed relief that their agonising search had finally come to an end. Last week after news that Helenas body had been foud, her family thanked those who had left comforting messages. “Helena was a beautul person and earth angel. She’s now an angel in heaven reunited with our Daddy, goddaughter and other family members,” a Facebook post read. Helena is survived by her husband Declan and four children, her mother Mary and her siblings Rosaleen, Teresa, Michael and Sean.For emotional support you can call the Samaritans -hour helpline on  , email jo@samaritans.org, visit a Samaritans branch in person or go to the Samaritans website. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A decision is then made as to as to whether they need to be seen face to face or can be given advice over the telephone.“Should a patient need to be seen by a GP, they will be offered an appointment at a suitable time. If there is no GP on sht in Mid-Ulster at that time orthe GP is unavailable because he or she is making home visits, patients will be offered the option to attend another base such as Ballymena, Antrim or Coleraine. On all occasions, patients can be assured that their medical needs will be safely met.“Dalriada Urgent Care continues to work with the Health and Social Care Board and local GPs to maximise the numbers of GPs available to work in the out of hours service.”The County Derry Post revealed last week that a number of people had experienced issues accessing the out-of-hours doctor service at its new Mid Ulster Hospital base.Sinn Fein MLA Emma Sheerin said she had been contacted by two local mothers who both, on separate occasions, had been forced to travel to Antrim after being told the facility wasnt open on Saturday evenings. The Mid Ulster Assembly woman highlighted the concerns to Northern Trust Chief Executive Tony Stevens.Ms Sheerin said yesterday: I welcome the response from HSCB, and indeed the invitation to meet with the team in Ballymena, which I am arranging for the coming week.I understand that pressures on staff have implications on services, and that no one can be in any two places at one time. However, a local GP in an emergency context is a necessity, and thus I believe this should be prioritised.The MLA added: I am constantly getting told by local constituents that waiting time for GP appointments are irrational and unfair, and I know from personal experience that it can be stressful to get seen in a timely manner. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It’s the second piece of good news for the school in recent months. In October funding of over pound, was approved to provide two double prefabricated classrooms as replacement accommodation for a double temporary classroom and two singular modular units.SDLP MLA for Mid Ulster, Patsy McGlone said he has pressed the new Minister for Education on the inclusion of St Patrick’s College in the SEP.“I have been in regular contact with St Patrick’s College, Maghera on the need for improvements to the school estate over recent years. I have had visits with Department officials, the school principal, the chair of the board of governors and Cllr Martin Kearney on site to see the school facilities.“Further enhancement to the school facilities on site will be required and the school enhancement programme for   provides an opportunity to deliver these improvements for St Patrick’s College.Mid Ulster Sinn Feacutein MLA Emma Sheerin welcomed the announcement that St Patrick’s College has been included on the programme.“The announcement of funding for the capital work is indeed very welcome and St Patrick’s College is a worthy recipient. A number of issues with leaking and damp forced them to make applications for upgrades to several buildings around the school, and they have previously been told that a replacement building for the technology department, to which this project relates, is not an option, and so this is a good interim measure. St Pats’ have an excellent reputation across South Derry and indeed have a huge catchment area, and it is dficult to expect any teaching body to carry out their work to a high standard when their facilities do not match up. “I have written to the minister to request further detail about the scale of the investment and I will continue to work with my local Council colleagues, as well as the school, to ensure that the matter progresses at the earliest opportunity.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Derry City and Strabane District Council is inviting children, young people and parents to take part in a special consultation event in the Guildhall next month, as part of its bid to achieve Unicef Child Friendly Community status. The Unicef Community and Youth Discovery Days will take place on Thursday February  and Friday February  in the Guildhall and will allow children and young people to discuss how they feel within their local community, as well as how their rights are respected or violated. googletag.cmd.push The event is being facilitated by Unicef UK in partnership with local statutory, community and voluntary sector organisations. Local young people from the Unicef Youth Advisory Panel will take a leading role, presenting and facilitating on the day. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Michaela Boyle, encouraged organisations working with children and young people aged - to get involved. “Child Friendly Communities aim to create cities and communities where all children, whether they live in care, use a children’s centre, visit a leisure centre or local library have a meaningful say in and truly benefit from the local decisions, services and spaces that shape their lives,” she explained. googletag.cmd.push “With expert training and guidance from Unicef UK, the partnership sees politicians, staff and volunteers turning to children’s rights – as set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child – to guide decisions that affect children and young people. “Ongoing work has been taking place at a local level and a range of youth and adult stakeholders have already been involved in remote consultation. “This event allows children and young people to have an input into the decisions that affect them – from major policies, to decisions around the care they receive. We will be talking about things like spaces to play and meet friends, being healthy and feeling safe” At the event young people will learn more about children’s rights globally and nationally and hear about the local picture. In the afternoon, attendees will work in groups to look at what’s going well and what needs attention for children and young people in the Council area. The agenda also includes a performance from young local musician ROE, winner of the Best Emerging Artist at the Northern Ireland Music Prize and support to Snow Patrol, Kodaline, Robbie Williams and The Coronas. ROE is taking time out of her busy schedule as she embarks on her very first headline tour of the UK. Claire Lynch, DSCDC Children and Young Peoples Coordinator, added: “ROE is passionate about supporting the community, especially on topics like mental health, the focus of some of her heart felt and quirky music. “The performance will add value to the discussions and creative workshops planned for the day. “It will give participants an alternative way to explore emotions and encourage them to be open about challenges while focusing on the importance of facing those challenges head on. “Consultation has identied that one of the biggest priorities for young people is mental health. “We need to work with the relevant partners to ensure that we develop more child friendly and accessible services, tailored to our local needs. “The partnership with Unicef UK gives us an opportunity to focus our attention in a joined up manner through the Community Planning approach”. Youth Advisory Member, Liam Mc Clintock looked ahead to the event: “I joined the group so I could give my opinion about things going on to try make Derry and Strabane a better place,” he said. “I’m looking forward to the day to see what happens. “I’m organising for a video I created with Third Space about Disability to be shown at the event. “I have experience of going through things that could help others and I want everyone to know that people with learning disabilities can do what other people do. “I want people to know thatyou have a learning disability you can do the things you want to do in le”. Naomi Danquah, Unicef UK’s Director of Child Friendly Cities and Communities, added: “This day is key in ensuring children and young people have the opportunity to contribute equally to decisions, share their views and help shape the direction of Derry City and Strabane’s Child Friendly Cities journey. “Guided by their ideas and experiences, we can work together for better outcomes for all children and young people in the community.” Anyone interested in taking part in the Youth Discovery Day should register their interest atyouth@derrystrabane.

Both of the goals were a bit unfortunate in a sense. For the first,Ryan Morrow doesn’t fall in the build-up I don’t think they’d score and then for the second the free kick has bounced just before the keeper and they reacted quicker,” Connor told the Derry News. “For them to be sitting top of the table and for us to be where we are, the gulf wasn’t massive. “If we can perform like that against the teams in and around us, then we’ll be fine. Sometimes when we play the teams around us we don’t perform like that, so we just need to keep our cool.”Connor also admitted that the timing of the second goal just before half-time really knocked the wind out of his side’s sails.“At - it’s a dficult game. Their game management was very good in the second half,” he said. “We huffed and puffed without really creating as much as we did in the first half when we had two or three really good chances. The dference was that when they got their chances, they were clinical.” googletag.cmd.push CHANGESGlentoran, with former Finn Harps captain Cowan amongst three debutants, made the brighter start to the game, with Marcus Kane trying his luck from  yards after three minutes, but it blazed high and wide of Rory Brown’s goal.Mick McDermott’s men were playing some slick stuff, and Kane played a crossfield pass to Hrvoje Plum that the Croatian fizzed across the face, but Aidan McCauley got a boot to it to clear.A foul on Alex Pomeroy by Kane earned the home side their first opportunity on ten minutes, but Evan Tweed’s delivery was taken off the head of a free Graham Crown by Caolan Marron.It was ‘Stute who had the first real chance on  minutes when Tweed slid a lovely ball in behind for Gareth Brown who beat Marron before squaring it for McCauley who was completely free at the back post, but on the stretch his left footed effort was blocked by Marijan Antolovic for a corner that came to nothing.It wasn’t long before they were punished for that miss as Glentoran took the lead on  minutes. An unfortunate slip from Ryan Morrow allowed Elvio Van Overbeek to latch on to Robbie McDaid’s pass, and after his floated cross was missed by Andy Mitchell, Navid Nasseri picked it up, jinked inside and finished to the bottom corner.‘Stute enjoyed a spell on top midway through the first half, and on  minutes Tweed and McCready linked up before the latter picked out McCauley in acres of space. He was allowed to run at the Glens defence before unleashing a drive from  yards, but it went wide of Antolovic’s left post.Nasseri’s free role and movement was causing the home defence problems, and on the half hour mark he drew a save out of Brown with a rasping shot into the former Wolves man’s chest.Antolovic then collected a weak header from Alex Pomeroy after Tweed’s free kick was nodded on by Dean Curry before a quick counter from the visitors ended with Christopher Gallagher slicing one over the top.Glentoran had regained control, and on  minutes debutant Marron swung a pinpoint ball deep to the back post where McDaid got his head on it, but the angle was too tight and Brown got behind it.The Belfast men made it - on  minutes when Tweed fouled Plum from behind. He tried to catch ‘Stute out by going for goal, and after Brown scrambled across to make the initial save, Keith Cowan was the man alert to finish to an empty net. googletag.cmd.push Half-timeInstitute Glentoran The visitors started the second half on the front foot, and inside two minutes Andy Mitchell whipped a ball into the box for McDaid, but he couldn’t make a proper connection as it bounced wide.The same pair linked up on  minutes, with McDaid controlling well on his chest ten yards out, but he volleyed over the top, with Nasseri also off target with a long distance attempt five minutes later.‘Stute had the ball in the net on  minutes as Aidan McCauley’s free from midfield sailed over the crowd to the net, but Alex Pomeroy was adjudged to have fouled Antolovic in his attempt to claim it.Sean Connor then made his first substitution, with Ahu Obhakhan replacing McCready, and he could have made an instant impact on the hour mark when McCauley picked out Pomeroy who held off Garrett before squaring for his strike partner at the back post, but it was just too far ahead of him to get a strong foot on it.On  minutes a long throw from Crown made it through to Tweed, but shot was blocked by Marron while moments later Morrow put in a strong tackle on Van Overbeek to win back possession and set up Brown – but his right footed strike floated over the bar.To their credit, ‘Stute kept pressing for a goal and on  minutes Cormac Burke played a long ball for Pomeroy to chase. He did well to turn on to his left but his shot sailed wide of the left upright.The Glens were pressing too, however, and Robbie McDaid tested Brown in the final minute of normal time with a well-placed header from a Kane cross, but the shot stopper held on well.

The Bangor attacker played in Kurtis Bell, who slotted the ball into the inside side-netting after Saintfield were dispossessed at the edge of their own box.Saintfield raised it a few gears and struck three times in the  minutes before half-time.The first came from Andrew Clarke after James Sofley was played down the line. After beating two defenders, James played in Andrew, who passed the ball into the bottom right-hand corner past the lsquokeeper.It took less than five minutes for left back Oliver Duff to score Saintfieldrsquos third. A long ball found Adam Childs on the left wing.He played it back to the edge of the box for Duff. He took one touch to set himself before striking a powerful left-footed shot into the bottom right corner.The Saints scored one more goal before the break with Andrew Clarke playing the ball across the face of goal for Tony Liken to finish at the back post. Saintfield went into half-time in the driving seat and - up.The second half started much like the first ended with Saintfield scoring an early goal.Ryan Sofley was the supplier of an own goal after bombing into the box and fizzing a cross into the near post which ricocheted off the Bangor defender into the net.At - up, the Saints took their foot off the gas and conceded just over five minutes after scoring.Bangor gained possession from a loose ball in midfield and played it into Matty Hall, who turned well to beat the Saintfield defender before striking the ball low and hard into the bottom corner.The Saints were again quick to respond with Andrew Clarke getting his hat-trick with half an hour still to go.Clarke started the move in midfield and finished it expertly after James Sofleyrsquos effort was parried by the lsquokeeper.Saintfield had a penalty and rebound saved less than two minutes later after James Sofley was brought down in the box.However, the Saints werenrsquot finished yet and Clarke had one more goal left in them with  minutes left to go. Possibly the best goal of the game, as he showed real determination and skill to score his fourth. Another counter-attacking goal from the Saints as they broke fast from a Bangor corner.Clarke received the ball just inside the Bangor half and stood tall after several attempts to bring him down. He beat three defenders before slotting home a cool finish into the bottom corner.This goal also signalled the end of the goalkeeperrsquos game after he strongly disagreed with the refereersquos decision to allow the goal to stand. Bangor had one more chance before the end of the game when they were also awarded a penalty, but David Harper kept the Saintsrsquo five-goal lead intact and made it a penalty saved for both teams.A great performance for Saintfield who progress to the next round of the cup and a fantastic performance from  year-old Andrew Clarke who relished his role as an attacking midfielder.Saintfield United Bangor Young Men CLARENCE CUP ND ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Call to begin work on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"THE re-establishment of the Stormont Executive has led to fresh calls for work to start on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed multi-million pound bypass.Newly appointed Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon is being urged to signal the start of construction work on the scheme which is estimated to cost in excess of poundm.South Down MP Chris Hazzard mdash a former roads minister in a previous Executive who signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December  mdash has written to Ms Mallon seeking an assurance that the Ballynahinch scheme remains a priority for her department and that construction work will start as soon as possible.In addition, Rowallane councillor Billy Walker is tabling a notice of motion at the February meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council seeking across-the-board political support to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon discuss the next step in the construction of the bypass.He also confirmed that Strangford MP, Jim Shannon, has written to Ms Mallon on the issue and is seeking a meeting with her to discuss the issue.There has been major progress on work on the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads, with work already completed on a major archaeological investigation along parts of the route.Work was due to complete on the schemersquos economic appraisal before the end of last year, with roads engineers confirming recently that in order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents was ongoing to ldquominimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.The by-pass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting that it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.They are also confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates the by-pass would provide a good economic .The scheme is designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the bypass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Mr Hazzard said that following his decision to formally sign off the scheme at the end of , the government department had been working through ious legal stages to ensure the scheme could commence as soon as possible.ldquoA programme of geotechnical investigation works on lands along theof the scheme was completed in  with advanced archeological investigation works completed last year, he confirmed.ldquoThis allowed the Department to move ahead with the final stage of preparing contract documentation in readiness of funding becoming available to construct the scheme.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWith an Infrastructure Minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont this week, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.Cllr Walker said it was the view of many, including senior roads engineers, that the multi-million pound scheme was vital to the survival of Ballynahinch town centre and will play a signicant role in helping boost the wider South Down economy.He said given that the project is shovel ready, it is essential that the cash is earmarked to allow construction work to start this year is forthcoming.ldquoMoving forward what is now required is the finance to build this scheme, continued Cllr Walker.ldquoIt is clear to me that when you look at other parts of Northern Ireland that Down District has consistently missed out on major roads funding. That must change and the cash needed to build Ballynahinchrsquos new bypass must be made available.The Rowallane councillor said that the bypass can help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre and act as a catalyst to encourage new investment.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe eagerly-awaited scheme can address town centre gridlock and along the main approach roads.

Lidl, which currently employs  staff, claims its proposal will create  new jobs.In late November, the local council confirmed that outline permission granted in March for the multi-million pound development was to be quashed as a result of a judicial review brought by developer Don Holdings Ltd.However, days later, the agenda for the December meeting of the Planning Committee included a plannersrsquo recommendation to approve the new store proposal.

They used a crowbar to prise the steel cabinet containing a store of dangerous drugs out of the wall. The cabinet was later found along the side of the Carrickmannon Road, near Ballygowan.The drugs taken included heroin and cocaine, both of which are dangerous even in small doses. They are types of hard drug in big demand on the black market. Additives like glucose are used by drug pushers to multiply the volume and increase profits. Other drugs, including morphine and strychnine, were also taken.The raid was the latest in a spate across the province and police fear that the addiction problem could be more serious than previously realised.Police chiefs have backed chemists pressing for an urgent review of the Home Office regulations about the keeping of prescribed drugs in steel cabinets.The present procedure is making things too easy for the thieves. It has meant that the hard drugs are all kept in the same place and the professional thief knows that.Before  regulations, chemists had better safeguards, evenit meant hiding the hard drugs on the general drugs shelves. It meant that thieves could not go straight to the security cabinet and other break it open or take it with them.The head of the RUCrsquos drugs squad, Chief Inspective George McBride, said he agreed that there was an urgent need to re-examine safety procedures for storage of dangerous drugs.DOWNPATRICK mdash Compensation for the destruction of St Patrickrsquos Hall in Downpatrick has been agreed mdash almost six years after it was destroyed by fire.The trustees of St Patrickrsquos Parish were awarded pound, at Downpatrick Crown Court last Friday after a two-hour hearing.The award was made in four parts, the bulkbeing attributable to physical damage and the remainder split between loss of profits , contentsand site value pound,.The claim had been before the court for over a year and was held up after the Northern Ireland Office disputed the amount of the parishrsquos claim for loss of profits.On Friday counsel for the Northern Ireland Office argued that the hall trustees had not made a big enough effort to reduce lost profits.

The Ballynahinch venture was unique in having a large amount of surviving documentation.Mr Reid says it is clear from these papers that the scheme organised by the First Presbyterian Church was sophisticated, comprehensive, self-funded, and cradle-to-grave in scope. It included widowsrsquo and old age pensions, end of le and burial grants, and support for orphans.Finance allocated to the project was known as lsquoThe Poorrsquos Moneyrsquo. The scheme operated late in the reign of William III and was continued into the time of Queen Anne, George I and George II.Nowadays benefit claimants unable to work through illness or injury, are paid Employment Support Allowance, .In  a similar scheme was obviously operating in Ballynahinch. The church carpenter at that time was John Gough, and that year he suffered a signicant injury, perhaps a broken arm or leg. He was unable to work or to earn a living for over a year.John had been married six years earlier in , in his home congregation by Rev James McAlpine. His we was Elizabeth, neacutee Ferguson. Their children soon followed mdash Christine, who was five in  Rebecca, who was four, and their twin boys, George and James, who were just one year and one month.With four young children and no income, John and Elizabeth were soon struggling financially. But in April the church stepped in immediately, with payments for an initial three-month period, at six shillings per instalment. In August John tried to resume work, but couldnrsquot. The church continued payments, but now at a reduced rate of d. Another attempt at work in October  failed again, and again payments resumed.John eventually recovered and ed to work permanently in August , having received a total of  support payments from First Presbyterian. He resumed his valuable role in maintenance of the fabric, receiving church contracts in ,  and .The problem of unwed mothers and absent fathers is one that troubles every age and every generation. Back in the early s, the Ballynahinch Session took a stern approach to fire-and-forget fatherhood.Their starting point was an interview with the expectant mother to ascertain the identity of her co-responsible male partner. If she proved uncompliant, exclusion from church attendance was then threatened. Faced with resultant near-total social ostracism, the mother-to-be soon cooperated.The next stage involved the errant couple appearing some Sunday morning before the entire congregation, kneeling on the Stool of Repentance and confessing their extramarital transgression. After that they were received back into the congregation. Their child was baptised and recognised as a church member.In a -year period the Ballynahinch Session dealt with  such cases. In six, they identied both parents. In six other cases only the mother was identied in seven, only the father. In one case the origins and surname of a lsquofoundlingrsquo child were known, but neither parent actually came forward.By st century standards, these church procedures sound draconian. But they had the purpose of protecting the rights of the child and of offering an opportunity to the parents for their reputations to be salvaged,possible.The alternatives were a lot worse. It was common in the s for the sexton at Magheradroll Parish Church to discover live newborns abandoned overnight on his church doorstep, ordead through neglect or infanticide, to find their bodies surreptitiously concealed in adjacent graves.In Ireland such surviving infants were sent in large numbers to the Foundling Hospital in Dublin, which who received between ,-, orphans annually. The hospitalrsquos mortality rate was some %.In Ballynahinch, under Presbyterian auspices, some such infants were spared this grisly fate. The lives of a number of potential orphans were actively protected by the church in their home town.Under the Welfare Reform Act of , Disabled Living Allowance was controversially replaced with Personal Independence Payment. DLA payments were made to claimants who often had long term medical conditions. The amount of the award ied according to the degree of disability.Interestingly, in Ballynahinch in the early s, First Presbyterian made a number of long-term DLA-type awards to some lsquosupplicantsrsquo.Ms Grissel Foreman was on such a benefit from -. Some financial records of the Poorrsquos Money still exist. But all its other documentation is lost, so we donrsquot know what Grisselrsquos ailment actually was. It was obviously slow and progressive, perhaps something like tuberculosis, or multiple sclerosis, or Parkinsonrsquos.As her condition deteriorated, the church increased its amount of financial support. In  she received seven payments totalling s d. By  this had escalated to  payments totalling pound s d.She died in  and was buried at church expense. Over  years, amounts paid to her totalled pound s d.

We must go out there and grab them by selling what the district has to offer.Cllr Curran said given that the Newry, Mourne and Down area is the third largest of the provincersquos  district councils, it should be an ldquoattractive proposition for potential investors.ldquoThe focus moving forward must be on new job creation in both the public and private sector. It is important that we sell what the area has to offer.In relation to public sector job opportunities, Cllr Curran said available space at the Downshire Civic Centre could be utilised by a number of government departments keen to decentralise their operations from the greater Belfast area.He continued: ldquoNew investment will not happen out of the blue. We all have a duty to work together to secure it. I believe we need new hotels and there is a need for such a facility in the Downpatrick area and hope see progress on this issue in the near future.Cllr Curran is particularly keen to see the proposed commercial development at the site of the former Irish Street police station in Downpatrick and a number of adjacent derelict buildings progressed this year.ldquoThis exciting proposal has the potential to restore Downpatrickrsquos economic heart, create jobs and, most importantly, provide a boost for existing businesses via increased footfall, he said.Cllr Curran also warned that while attracting new investment is crucial, cracking Downpatrickrsquos traffic congestion problem is also essential.ldquoGridlock continues to stle town centre investment and we need to act quickly. While expensive schemes have been proposed in the past, nothing has happened. We must see progress in  and ensure roads officials deliver.ldquoWork was completed recently on a major upgrade of the Collinsrsquo Corner junction and while welcome, I and others remain to be convinced that it will address congestion problems in the heart of the town.Cllr Curran said roads officials also deserve praise for the improvement scheme in Fountain Street and hopes that in  efforts will be made by the Department for Infrastructure to improve Edward Street.He added: ldquoThis is a real problem area which has not been addressed. The presence of a busy primary school should ensure that roads officials redouble their efforts to improve driver and pedestrian safety. In addition, urgent action is needed to ban large vehicles, especially lorries, from this built-up area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Looking.jpg","title":"Looking back at end of steam railways  ","story":"SEVENTY years ago today, the first part of Northern Irelandrsquos railway network literally came to the end of the line, with the axe falling on a large part of the old Belfast and County Down Railway, marking the end of  years of railway transport in East Down.On January , , railway stations south of Comber fell quiet and an eerie silence descended upon mile after mile of what had once been a key transport corridor.No longer would the rumble of trains and passenger-filled carriages pass through on their way to Castlewellan or Newcastle, stopping at Ballygowan, Saintfield, Ballynahinch junction, Crossgar, or Dundrum on the way, or perhaps branching off after Downpatrick for Ardglass.Later, on April , , services from Belfast to Comber - with stops at Bloomfield, Neillrsquos Hill, Knock, Dundonald and on to Donaghadee also ceased.Robert Gardiner, chairman of the Downpatrick and County Down Railway, a heritage railway set up on the former Downpatrick BCDR terminus, states that had the line survived to today, it would form a vital transport link between the commuter belt into the Northern Irish capital.ldquoIt seems incredible today to think that such a vital transport link could be easily discarded, he says. ldquoBut in  the ministers in the devolved Stormont Government took the view that railways were as obsolete as the stagecoach.ldquoIn a way, they were right that the lines were Edwardian relics mdash and the BCDR in particular still operated obsolete Victorian carriages mdash but investment since then in new technologies in track, signalling and rolling stock have shown what we could have had throughout Northern Ireland.ldquoBut even then, in  an express train from Comber to Belfast could get you into the old Queenrsquos Quay station near the Odyssey area in  minutes ndash despite the investment in the Glider and other public transport initiatives nothing has come close to replicating that speed and efficiency.Up to the s, the main railway network in Northern Ireland was operated by three major railway companies mdash the London Midland and Scottish Railwayrsquos Northern Counties lines, which operated out of York Road Station to Larne and Londonderry the Great Northern Railway of Ireland, which operated out of Great Victoria Street Station to places like Dungannon, Armagh, as well as Dublin and the Belfast and County Down Railway, based at Queenrsquos Quay Station.In , the Stormont government decided to nationalise the network and amalgamate the LMS and BCDR with the bus operator, the Northern Ireland Road Transport Board, to form the Ulster Transport Authority, a predecessor to Translink.Mr Gardiner explains, ldquoA tribunal was set up to consider how this could be best achieved and provide an integrated transport system. Rail chiefs, who had been hoping for investment after the railways had proved so crucial to the war effort a few years earlier and that the buses would be barred from competing with the trains and instead provide a feeder service to stations, were devastated at the outcome.ldquoThe recommendation, accepted by Stormont, was that the entire Belfast and County Down Railway main line from Belfast to Newcastle, including the branches to Donaghadee, Ballynahinch and Ardglass, should be closed.The only route to be saved was the Belfast to Bangor connection, which continues operating successfully to this day.Mr Gardiner continued: ldquoThe attitude of Stormont was that it would be cheaper to move everything to the roads than to invest in railways that had been run down during the Second World War. People would use the buses instead. They developed huge road building schemes mdash most were never completed mdash but closed the railways first before these were even started. It seems incredible today.ldquoThe most puzzling element of the decision was the axing of the Belfast to Newtownards line, which served the east of the city mdash Dundonald, Knock and Comber areas in which the suburbs were developing and likely to provide increased commuter traffic had they been spared.ldquoIndeed, there were more than enough new diesel trains ordered to operate both the Bangor and Newtownards lines mdash and evidence suggests that the Transport Tribunal expected Stormont to spare the Comber line as a compromise option and as late as , before the tracks were lted, they were calling on the minister responsible to reverse the decision and trial these new diesel trains on this section of track mdash a call that fell on deaf ears.The  closures were the first steps in a plan which was to see the reduction of the Northern Irelandrsquos railway network from  miles to  miles mdash a decrease of  per cent.A decade later, the Great Northern Railway was ided between the UTA and its counterpart in the Republic, CIE, and further closures to lines to Armagh, Dungannon, Omagh and Strabane occurred.Willie Watterson and James Magill, who were porters and ticket clerks at Newcastle and Tullymurry stations, recalled their memories of the last train in an interview recorded for the BBC documentary lsquoRaising Steamrsquo in ldquoThe last train was a Sunday night. It was a cold winter night, January , , said Willie. There was twelve coaches, and two engines and two guards. She was packed. Packed to the doors. So I lit all the lamps, and put detonators on the line to give her a send-off.James added: ldquoI think every station did the same thing, so when the train came in there was a salute of bangs. I felt terrible about it, terribly terribly sad. I still felt it couldnrsquot happen. Still felt theyrsquoll come back, theyrsquoll run again. I couldnrsquot believe therersquod be no more railways, after working on them so hard.Adam Hamilton, who was a fireman mdash the person who stoked the fire on the steam locomotives mdash said: ldquoIt broke my heart, because the railways were in my blood. I still hear the sound of the steam still running on a clear night puffing away.Today, the Downpatrick and County Down Railway keeps the memory alive through its reconstruction of two miles of the former main line, as well as restored carriages rescued from their fate as hen houses.As part of its commemorations of the BCDRrsquos demise, it is keen to make contact with anyone who had any connection with the network, including former employees or their families, or people in possession of railway memorabilia such as photographs, tickets, timetables or even carriages.Mr Gardiner added: ldquoOne thing we would love for the museum is a BCDR unorm or tunic. So far we have been unable to track one down. Perhaps you have something in your loft And what of the future of the line  In November  the section of the BCDRrsquos former main line from Holywood Arches to Comber was opened as the Comber Greenway, whilst other sections have been used for roads as well as the section around Downpatrick being used by the DCDR.In the early s Northern Ireland Railways prepared a feasibility study into reopening the line to Newtownards, but this was not taken further by the Direct Rule administration.In May , the Department for Regional Development published its Railway Investment Prioritisation Strategy, which promised feasibility studies into the reopening of closed railway routes to Armagh, Dungannon and Castledawson by , but not including the Comber Newtownards route.However, maybe  years after the first railway closure in Northern Ireland, the new Minister for Infrastructure in the restored Stormont Government might see the first of those historic mistakes rectied.The Downpatrick Railway Museum can be contacted via email at info@downrail or message at www.facebook downrail..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Mickey.jpg","title":"Mickey ‘magic’ to help Magpies lift cup  ","story":"KILCOOrsquoS tearaways may hold the key to success in Sundayrsquos All-Ireland Club SFC final at Croke Park.The ability of their six forwards to win dirty ball and turnovers could dismantle the perceived invincibility of Corofinrsquos much-vaunted defensive system.Corofin, described in many quarters as the best club team ever, have an enviable set of defenders who squeeze the le out of the opposition.However, they have never encountered a team like Kilcoo before that has  attackers and  defenders.Conor Laverty, the three Johnston brothers mdash Ryan, Jerome and Shealan mdash Paul Devlin and Ryan McEvoy fight tooth and nail for every ball.They are the clubrsquos first line of defence and are not afraid to go where angels fear to tread, but can then turn into a snatch squad with the blink of an eye.Kilcoo will have to be at their bestthey are to cause an upset as the Galway and Connacht champions are sizzling hot favourites at   to win the Andy Merrigan Cup for an unprecedented third year in a row and the fourth time in six years.Certainly, Kilcoo have it all to do, but they fear no side.Manager Mickey Moran has twice taken Slaughtneil to All-Ireland finals day and few would begrudge the Derry man a first title with Kilcoo.He has transformed the Magpies into a ruthless, disciplined machine in a quiet, unobtrusive way and has won many admirers for his style of play.He started out in management in  when he took over the reins at Derry, the first of three separate spells in charge of the county team.

Maybe its just a bit of magic dust, but itrsquos definitely a unique ability to get players to play for him.ldquoIt doesnrsquot matter what age you are. If you are good enough, he will give you a chance, he added.ldquoDonrsquot forget we won the Ulster League last season with five or six minors starting regularly every week.ldquoThat injection of youth sure helped the lads get a great start to the season and everything fell into place after that, he continued.Gilligan also believes that Moranrsquos love for the game and the way it should be played has rubbed off on the players.ldquoMickey is extremely keen on discipline. He insists the players play the game and let the referee do his thing without being shouted at.ldquoHe doesnrsquot rant or rave from the sidelines and expects that same response from the players and gets it, he added.Dedication and team structure are what he has instilled at Eoghan Rua Parc and a love for the game along with a winning environment.Kilcoo have been the benchmark in Down football for the past decade, but Moran has taken them a stage further in just  months.Corofin may be blessed with several players who have turned out regularly for Galway and in Kieran Fitzgerald, Liam Silke, Kieran McGrath, Gary Sice and Ian and Daithi Burke they have the nucleus of a talented outfit.However, Kilcoo believe they bigger they are, the harder they fall..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Minister.jpg","title":"Minister vows to end strikes with pay deal  ","story":"HEALTH staff across the district were yesterday digesting the news that new Stormont Health Minister Robin Swann had confirmed that pay parity with their colleagues in England can now be restored.He told the Assembly that it would cost an extra poundm that would come from within existing Stormont finances.Mr Swann met with representatives from a number of leading health trade unions to brief them on the decision, describing the talks as ldquoconstructive.The new man in charge of the Provincersquos health portfolio said the ldquobreakthrough that we all wanted has been achieved this isa good day after some very dficult days.Mr Swann announced that the Department of Health had already gathered together poundm to increase pay for health workers, with an extra poundm being pulled from existing finances at Stormont.His decision to address the pay issue came after a series of strikes involving staff across the health and social services sector over pay and staffing levels.Nurses and other health workers in Northern Ireland have been taking industrial action over pay and staffing levels, with Mr Swann confirming that his officials would work with the unions on the issue of safe staffing levels in the health service and hopes a plan can be drawn up to establish such levels ldquowithin a reasonable period of time.Today, representatives from trade unions representing nurses and all health and social services staff will meet with Department of Health officials, with Mr Swann hoping for a ldquoswt end to their industrial action.He added: ldquoOur nurses and great social care workers can come off the picket-line.Prior to yesterdayrsquos announcement, local nurses said that they hoped that theof Stormont would pave the way for the pay parity and staffing issues to be finally addressed.Ahead of yesterdayrsquos meeting, the RCN said while welcoming the restoration of the Stormont administration, nurses had been made many promises.The RCNrsquos Northern Ireland Director, Pat Cullen, said nurses wanted to see those promises converted into action.Last Wednesday and Friday, nurses based at the Downpatrick hospitals took part in the latest round of stoppages and were buoyed by the support of passing motorists and others as they manned the picket-line at the entrance to the Downshire Civic Centre.Braving bitterly cold conditions last Friday morning, nurses were hoping for positive news from Stormont, hours after Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney had published the New Decade New Approach document.Nurses, who had sacriced another dayrsquos pay, were joined at one stage on the picket-line by South Eastern Trust interim chief executive Seamus McGoran and Roisin Coulter, the organisationrsquos director of planning.Nurses said that they hoped that the political parties would go back into government and that their demands for pay parity and safe staffing levels would be met.ldquoWe believe that the collective pressure of health service staff has ensured that politicians know that they must get back to Stormont, said nurse Irene Murray.ldquoWe do not want to be used as political pawns and hope that there is cross-party agreement for politicians to get back to work. While pay parity and safe services are key issues for us, the key thing is that there are enough recurrent resources in place to deliver this now and in the future.Irene said the RCN is about putting patients first, describing the scale of the hospital waiting list issue as ldquounacceptable.She added: ldquoEmploying more nurses can help bring waiting lists down. This is not a new phenomena. It is tough to work as a nurse and it is not an easy job. But we currently have a situation where some nurses are taking on extra shts to earn more money, but that is just an unacceptable way to live.Alison Megarry said patients are nursesrsquo primary concern and at the heart of what they do, highlighting the need to keep staff working in Northern Ireland to ensure they donrsquot go across the water and donrsquot come back.She revealed that she was talking to a nursing sister last week who was working on international recruitment for nurses in Mumbai to work in Northern Ireland.ldquoThe nurses in India said why would they come here when the pay is less than it is in England, Scotland and Wales. I believe thatwe can keep our nurses here, it will help to tackle the waiting list issue, she said. ldquoThe big issue we have is that the population is ageing and people are living longer which therefore impacts on waiting lists.Nurse Sonia McCoubrey said that while pay parity is one issue, additional nurses are also required. She said many newly qualied nurses are choosing to go to England, Scotland or Wales because the money is better.She also said she worries about the safety of newly qualied nurses managing dficult situations and the patients they are caring for.ldquoYou have trolley waits and people lying in corridors. There is no privacy, no dignity and the situation is appalling. You go home at night after a sht burnt out and worried about what you have seen, the nurse added.Nurse Donna Boyd also expressed concern about waiting lists and said she fears that the situation is going to get worse, forcing many people to go private.ldquoIf more money is put into the system nurses are quite happy to do even more to help reduce waiting lists. All nurses go and above what is required of them when they are working, often staying after their scheduled quitting time which is unpaid work, she said.ldquoWith more people going private because of y waiting lists, a lot of the doctors and consultants are taking on private lists which then impacts on the NHS list. I have friends who were nurses who have left the profession to work in supermarkets because they have burnt themselves out. They canrsquot cope with the demands being made on them, she added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Now.jpg","title":"Now is the time for delivery – McGrath  ","story":"THE restoration of the Assembly and Northern Ireland Executive should herald delivery for people at the start of a new decade, according to South Down SDLP MLA Colin McGrath.Mr McGrath was able to take his seat in the Assembly chamber for the first time in three years last Saturday, an occasion which he described as a ldquomomentous day for Northern Ireland and its future.He said that with so many issues staring people in the face including Brexit, y hospital waiting times, workersrsquo rights and wages, welfare issues and an education system in crisis, Northern Ireland needed a restored and fully ing Assembly and Executive to deal with these mammoth issues.The Assemblyman described his partyrsquos decision to re-enter the Executive as an act of ldquotrust and goodwill.He continued: ldquoWe all know the reasons why the last Executive failed and these have been well covered.

The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.Last month, the Department for Infrastructure confirmed that its current budget for street lighting repairs was approximately poundm, explaining that the figure was much lower than the pound.m needed to provide a full street lighting repair service.It also revealed that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce which only consists of five full and three part time electricians.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran described the number of reported street light faults across large parts of East Down as ldquoalarming and hopes that the money to expedite much-needed repairs will be earmarked by the new Stormont Executive.He said broken street lights in many areas represent a health and safety issue, explaining that an examination of every town and village across the district will reveal a signicant number of faults.Cllr Curran described faulty street lights as a ldquohot topic with politicians being contacted about the issue on all almost daily basis. He said the legacy of underfunding the roads department has experienced is now clear for all to see.The politician said many will be concerned that the Department for Infrastructure does not have the money it requires to carry out much-needed repairs.ldquoWhile I understand the decision to prioritise emergency repairs, there is no doubt that the alarming figure of almost  faulty street lights across East Down is simply going to increase. Clearly the issue is going to get a lot worse before it gets better, he said.ldquoStreet lights which are not working in areas where elderly people and indeed young families live poses a major problem. A fully working street lighting system provides residents with a sense of security and helps deter would-be criminals.Cllr Curran said that while the new Stormont Executive will inevitably face calls for investment in many key areas including health and education, the Department of Infrastructure also required an injection of funding.He added: ldquoWhile the focus for some will be on major new roads schemes which is understandable, it is clear that the creaking infrastructure the government department is responsible for, including street lighting, requires major cash injection.ldquoThe street lighting issues requires immediate attention. We are still in the grip of winter and several months away from the clearer evenings. Now that we have a local minister in place, I hope to meet her on this issue and other matters of local importance.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure said that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continued to face budget challenges and resources were currently not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service.She added: ldquoDue to this restricted service, outages are taking longer than usual to be repaired. However, priority will be given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Tributes.jpg","title":"Tributes to lawyer who was ‘a real gentleman’  ","story":"TRIBUTES have been paid to a lawyer who died last week.Mr Paul McAlinden, who was a barrister, died peacefully in Belfast City Hospital last Wednesday.

In any event it is simply absurd to suggest that such a veto –it existed – could trump the commissioner exercising his or her statutory s, namely to “enhance” the Irish language.However,we are to offer the DUP the benefit of the doubt, then it is crucial that they outline for the unionist community precisely which standards they will find acceptable, and which standards they will use their ‘veto’ to block Furthermore – and separate from the issue of standards – in my view it is beyond dispute that the deal includes a stand-alone Irish Language Bill which would amend the Northern Ireland Act .I submit that this is even worse than a stand-alone Irish Language Act, given that the  Act which it would amend is something the House of Lords has determined is, in effect, a constitutional statute – essentially setting out the constitutional basis for Northern Ireland. Clearly the successful passage of such a Bill would conflict the DUP’s repeated promises that there would be no stand-alone Irish language legislation.Therefore two questions arise: firstly, will the DUP sign a Petition of Concern – which the TUV would sign and surely so too would the UUP given they havecriticised the Irish language legislation in the deal – in order to block the passage of the stand-alone Irish language legislation And secondly,they will not sign a Petition of Concern, then will DUP members vote for, or against, the passage of the stand-alone Irish language legislation If we even look to the first week of ‘New Decade, New Approach’ there is one truism upon which all parties agree: We do not have an endless supply of money, and therefore the Executive must prioritise.If we then logically move on from that to the next stage of any coherent thought process, we arrive at another truism the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland and political parties agree that our main priorities are – health, education and improved public services. As such we have identied the priorities, and therefore the available finances should be directed towards those key priority areas.The logical conclusion therefore is that issues such as the Irish Language and Ulster Scots must give way. Spending money on such pursuits would be to ert much needed financial resources from the most important areas, in order to satisfy the political demands of a minority.Christ did not tell prostitute: ‘Carry on, your lestyle is fine’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Only in the world of the ‘process’ would logic be suspended in order to arrive at another conclusion namely that Irish Language and Ulster Scots commissioners should be equally as important as doctors, nurses and mental health specialists.That is the problem when you build a political system which requires the feeding of a constant concession-meter in order to incrementally satisfy the political demands of one part of a mandatory coalition.

We support the independence of this process.”The comments were echoed by Sinn Fein. “MLA’s pay is set by an independent body, not by MLAs,” a spokesman said. “MLAs had no input into this decision, nor did they seek it.” But Harry Fone, grassroots campaign manager at the TaxPayers’ Alliance said most people could not dream of such a pay rise.“Many taxpayers will rightly askthis is the best use of their hard-earned cash,” he said. “In the current economic climate most people can only dream of such a generous pay rise. Assembly members must demonstrate to their constituents they are worth their salaries.”Alan McQuillan, a member of Independent Financial Review Panel until , said they approved an annual pay rise of £ for MLAsinflation rose above % in any year. As inflation had been around % for the past three years, the £ is “fair enough” he said. In fact the £ was sub-inflationary, so the MLAs’ salaries have actually been losing spending power as the  only estimated inflation reaching around !% per year, he added.SDLP calls for NI Audit Office action at council Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingPSNI confirm route slow moving ambulance will take - motorists urged to remain patientPassengers were sobbing and making calls to loved ones - Aer Lingus pilot hailed miraculous after landing plane during Storm BrendanNI Snow Alert: Experts predict snowfall this weekend and next week - subzero temperatures expected across NIWill it snow in February   Northern Ireland long-range weather forecast as heavy rain and strong winds set to hitThis time its tears of happiness - Cate Conway shares hilarious Stephen Clements prank video involving leopard print leggings        v.. -  applyImgSrcs\" i sb  for   sb* sb u  o.dataset.srcu  u.replaceo.setAttributeo.setAttributedocumentwindowapplyImgSrcs JP  JP  JP  \"NA-BELFNEWS-\"JP  \"Politics\"      Follow Us On       Explore News Sport Irish League Football Whats On Lestyle   Farming Le   More from the Belfast News Letter  Announcements Buy a Photo  Directory Jobs Homes Cars Local Guide  Public Notices  Reader Shop Must Read Read This Events   Useful Links Contact Us   Place your Ad Advertise a Job Subscribe  Readers Charter        ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and travel","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

They each received weekly book vouchers, provided by Egmont, to spend at Grfin Books, and coffee shop vouchers donated by local businesses.In , the families committed to reading with their children for  minutes per day.The bookshoprsquos owner, Mel Grfin, said:\"We were delighted to be selected to participate in this exciting project. The idea was to encourage children to experience the joy of reading for pleasure, rather than seeing it as just something they have to do for school\"Research shows that being able to choose their own books, as well as sitting down regularly to read with a parent, makes a real dference to childrens enjoyment of reading. This in turn benefits their schoolwork across the whole curriculum, not just in literacy.\"We are also grateful to the local businesses who generously donated the coffee shop vouchers to help make this happen.ldquoThe contributions of local businesses show once again what great community spirit we have here in Penarth!\"In total,  local businesses donated coffee shop vouchers.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The report found that, for example, among boys and girls who perform similarly in science, in many countries the boys are more likely to expect to work in science and engineering.UK students do have a level of career exposure, Mr Schleicher said, such as opportunities for internships and job shadowing, but there are ldquomany interesting future-oriented jobs that British students are not seeing, particularly disadvantaged kids, and you canrsquot be what you canrsquot see.He also said that in general, ldquothe most important decisions about future careers are made in primary school.

And thatrsquos because many MPs and members feel the compromise that wersquove reached so far produces a culture where members have to negatively campaign against a sitting MP.ldquoIt doesnrsquot offer the opportunity for new candidates who want to come through to emerge without a stigma in being part of that negative campaigning.Four candidates remain in the race to replace Mr Corbyn, after Jess Phillips abandoned her bid as she admitted she would not be able to bring the party together after its ldquocataclysmic election defeat.The outspoken backbencher, who was a prominent critic of Mr Corbynrsquos leadership, acknowledged she would not be able to unite the unions, members and Labour MPs behind her..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Lisa Nandy: New Labour years continued  uThatcherite consensus u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.

The firm is marking two decades leading the way in the industry, and according to founder Terry Moore, the firm is well on its way to doubling its size and embracing the latest technology for its clients Outsource Solutions is a firm which is ahead of the curve when it comes to emerging technologies and a company which embeds itself in a client’s business to ensure total integration – ultimately helping to boost it and help it grow.“Our approach is to embed ourselves into the customer’s business, and take IT out of the boardroom,” Terry says. “What we do is try to get ahead of some of the problems, understand the business and recognise that the technology is there to benefit the company.“We are there to make sure that business is possible – enriching lives, making things easier and safer. An important part of this is the relationships that we have.”Terry formed Outsource Solutions  years ago, around the time of the so-called ‘millennium bug’ when he says some firms were using scare tactics to get businesses to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds, often unnecessarily. “For me, one of the things I felt was missing was understanding a business and factoring that refresh into it over a few years – letting them get on with what they do.”The company – which now has five locations, including Belfast – is a full service IT firm which manages every element of a business’s infrastructure, including security, enterprise wi-fi, telecoms and networking.“We now have just over  staff and are we are on a five-year plan to double in size again. There has been considerable growth in areas such as enterprise wi-fi, converged networks and telecoms,” Terry says.Client retention is also something which Terry and the business prides itself on. “Every customer that we signed up with in , we still work with,” he says. “We will give a recommendation as to how we think a network should be built. If they accept that, then we take it on as a risk.“Technology is just a toolbox for us to allow us to deliver IT – technology to allow them to really access and control their data.”Outsource is a business which has been at the forefront of emerging developments in technology, including cyber-security. Terry says, even just a few years ago, it wasn’t being taken seriously by many businesses. That has now changed signicantly.“In the last couple of years, cyber has completely exploded – but we were ahead of our time,” he says. “My experience of last  years and the last five in particular is that there has been a massive job to do in educating businesses and their users about the cyber threat.“We have reached the tipping point and the human firewall is becoming much stronger – people and users are more sensitive to what it means, making it all a far better place. But there are still businesses which are happy to cut fast and loose, and take risks.”While the company’s client base started off in professional services businesses – such as law and accounting – it’s grown into a host of sectors, including transport, logistics, manufacturing and engineering.“We have carved out a niche in hospitality as well – particularly in areas such as enterprise wi-fi, converged networks and communication, generally.”Terry says Outsource is seeing business growth among many of Northern Ireland’s medium-sized businesses, with more than  staff.“Our job is to enhance, improve and optimise the performance for as many users as we can. Our aim over the next four years is to be able to deliver those services outside Northern Ireland, across the rest of the UK and into the Republic of Ireland.“For us, the constant is that we are always there at that point of where technology is consumed. The role we play is being integrated and a trusted advisor. That’s how we will continue to be successful.”As for the next  years, with a rise in automation and articial intelligence – something Terry says has to become a little more intelligent and a little less articial – the next major leap will be the advent of quantum computing. It’s something which remains in its infancy.“While it’s still early, we are on the verge of the most aggressive technological change that any of us have ever seen,” he says.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
