But what if we ditched the data and embraced ancient technology instead? Cities is concluding with ‘The case for ...”, a series of opinion pieces exploring options for radical urban change. Read our editor’s farewell hereEver since smartphones hooked us with their limitless possibilities and dopamine hits, mayors and city bureaucrats can’t get enough of the notion of smart-washing their cities. It makes them sound dynamic and attractive to business. What’s not to love about whizzkids streamlining your responsibilities for running services, optimising efficiency and keeping citizens safe into a bunch of fun apps?There’s no concrete definition of a smart city, but high-tech versions promise to use cameras and sensors to monitor everyone and everything, from bins to bridges, and use the resulting data to help the city run smoothly. One high-profile proposal by Google’s sister company, Sidewalk Labs, to give 12 acres of Toronto a smart makeover is facing a massive backlash. In September, an independent report called the plans “frustratingly abstract” in turn US tech investor Roger McNamee warned Google can’t be trusted with such data, calling the project “surveillance capitalism”.There are practical considerations, too, as Shoshanna Saxe of the University of Toronto has highlighted. Smart cities, she wrote in the New York Times in July, “will be exceedingly complex to manage, with all sorts of unpredictable vulnerabilities”. Tech products age fast: what happens when the sensors fail? And can cities afford expensive new teams of tech staff, as well as keeping the ground workers they’ll still need? “If smart data identifies a road that needs paving,” she writes, “it still needs people to show up with asphalt and a steamroller.”Saxe pithily calls for redirecting some of our energy toward building “excellent dumb cities.” She’s not anti-technology, it’s just that she thinks smart cities may be unnecessary. “For many of our challenges, we don’t need new technologies or new ideas we need the will, foresight and courage to use the best of the old ideas,” she says.Saxe is right. In fact, she could go further. There’s old, and then there’s old – and for urban landscapes increasingly vulnerable to floods, adverse weather, carbon overload, choking pollution and an unhealthy disconnect between humans and nature, there’s a strong case for looking beyond old technologies to ancient technologies.It is eminently possible to weave ancient knowledge of how to live symbiotically with nature into how we shape the cities of the future, before this wisdom is lost forever. We can rewild our urban landscapes, and apply low-tech ecological solutions to drainage, wastewater processing, flood survival, local agriculture and pollution that have worked for indigenous peoples for thousands of years, with no need for electronic sensors, computer servers or extra IT support.This month, Julia Watson, a lecturer in urban design at Harvard and Columbia Universities, launched her book Lo-Tek: Design by Radical Indigenism, with publisher Taschen. It’s the result of more than 20 years of travelling to research the original smart settlements, through an architect’s lens.She visited the Ma’dan people in Iraq, who weave buildings and floating islands from reeds the Zuni people in New Mexico, who create “waffle gardens” to capture, store and manipulate water for desert crop farming and the subak rice terraces of Bali. Watson walked the living tree-root bridges that can withstand adverse weather better than any human-made structure, and that allow the Khasi hill tribe in Northern India to travel between villages during the monsoon floods.“There are so many different ways you can rewild cities,” says Watson – and it’s not just a case of plonking an ancient system in a city, but rather adapting complex ecosystems for different types of places with their own unique requirements. Take a current proposal she is working on for the high-rise city of Shenzhen on the Pearl River estuary by Hong Kong. It was once a fishing village, then a textile town, “and it just skyrocketed,” says Watson. “All of the fishponds and polders and dykes and wetlands that absorb all the water in that delta landscape are being erased. So the city is developing in a way that’s erasing the indigenous resilience in the landscape.”But you don’t have to erase to go forwards, she says. “You can leapfrog and embed local intelligence, using a nature-based traditional Chinese technology that’s climate resilient, ecologically resilient and culturally resilient. And we can make beautiful urban spaces with them as well.”Kongjian Yu, a design professor at Peking University, agrees with this philosophy. Known as the “sponge cities” architect, Yu creates urban landscapes in China that passively absorb rainwater, using permeable pavements, green roofs and terraced wetland parks that flood during monsoon. If wetlands are situated upriver of the buildings, they will flood before the water reaches the city proper.The parks have brought fish and birds back to cities, says Yu, “and people love it.” The projects, he says, “are performing well, and many of them have been tested for over 10 years, and can certainly be replicable in other parts of the world.” In fact, this month he has visited Bangladesh, ironically, “helping their ‘smart city’ project,” where he has convinced “the minister in charge that nature is smart, and our ancient wisdom tells us how to live with nature in a smart way.” Copenhagen, too, has opted for a dumb – or, as local planners call it, “a green and blue” – solution to their increasing flood risks: namely, a series of parks that can become lakes during storms. The city estimated they would cost a third less than building levees and new sewers, and come with the added ecological benefits of rewilding. An abandoned military site was cleaned up in 2010 and rewilded into a nature reserve and common for grazing animals, the Amager Nature Centre – a vast park with not only happy people meandering and cycling around but insects, protected amphibians, rare birds and deer.But dumb cities can be even smarter than that. Not only can functioning wetlands defend cities against floods and restore nature, they can clean wastewater. And they can do it more efficiently than sewage-treatment works – all while absorbing a whole lot of carbon, nitrogen, sulphur and methane, and creating a fishing industry and fertile farmland. No water, energy, treatment chemicals or fish feed required. The world’s largest such system, in east Kolkata in India, involves the city’s sewage feeding the fish. It saves the city approximately $22m (£17m) a year in running costs for a waste treatment plant. The water can be used for irrigation, saving a further £500,000 in water and fertiliser costs. And it enables much of the city’s food to be grown locally.Or, as waters rise globally, we can learn from Makoko, the incredible city-on-stilts in Lagos that is home to 80,000 residents. Its “floating school” – sustainable and solar-fuelled – has captured the world’s imagination. Rotterdam has already introduced a floating forest and farm, and is developing plans for a sustainable floating city.As for dumb transport, there can be no doubt that walking or cycling are superior to car travel over short urban distances: zero pollution, zero carbon emissions, free exercise. A few token green walls and trees won’t do it. Watson calls for a focus on permaculture: self-sustaining ecosystems. “If it’s an urban forest,” she says, “perhaps it’s in the centre of the city, perhaps it’s on the periphery, or it could be an interior environment – an atrium designed to have a complex ecosystem that’s also agriculturally productive.”There are hundreds of nature-based technologies that have never been explored. For example, Watson envisions stunning urban uses for the living root bridges of the Khasi hill tribe: “They could be grown to reduce the urban heat island effect by increasing canopy cover along streets, with roots trained into trusses that integrate with the architecture of the street – in essence, removing the distinction between tree and building.” They could even retain their original use during seasonal floods – living, physical bridges over the water. In April, Greta Thunberg and  columnist George Monbiot made a rallying video calling for more trees and wetlands and plant cover to tackle the climate crisis. Cities can be part of this push. The idea of smart cities is born of what Watson describes as “the same human superiority-complex that thinks nature should be controlled”. What’s missing is symbiosis. “Life on Earth is based upon symbiosis,” Watson says. She suggests we replace the saying “survival of the fittest” with “survival of the most symbiotic”. Not as catchy, perhaps.

I want to win the next election and establish a new, fairer economic model • Keir Starmer sets out vision for Labour to win back powerI have always been motivated by a burning desire to tackle inequality and injustice, to stand up for the powerless against the powerful. That’s my socialism. If I see something wrong or spot an injustice, I want to put it right. It’s why I spent 20 years fighting the death penalty across the world, why I marched against the Iraq war, and why I defended the rights of victims of domestic violence as director of public prosecutions.Today’s inequalities and injustices are obvious: a radical Labour government is needed now more than ever. Inequalities of every type – in power, education, health and wealth – have become ingrained in our society.A generation of children, including my own, have never known a time without homelessness on our streets. Our public services have been decimated by cuts, leaving schools begging parents for money, and sick patients in hospital corridors. The Tories’ assault on welfare has stripped people of their dignity. The future of our children is too often determined by where they are born, and their class, race and gender. We cannot walk past these inequalities and injustices.Labour lost the election. But the moral fight against inequality and injustice must continue. We must lead that fight against a prime minister with no conviction or principles. Our arguments must be made in parliament, and we must also take them to the country – to the communities we lost at the election, whose trust we need to win back.As we learn the lessons of our defeat we must relentlessly focus on the future. We can win again if we make the moral case for socialism, a moral socialism that is relevant to people’s everyday lives and the challenges we face as we move into the 2020s and 2030s. There are three foundations to this: economic justice, social justice and climate justice. I believe the free-market economy has failed. It leaves too many people behind, and has fuelled gross inequality. We should be arguing for a new economic model that reduces that inequality, supports trade unions, gives people a real voice in their workplace and enables communities to thrive.The argument that something can be good for the economy but bad for the environment must end. If it’s bad for the environment, then it is bad for the economy. We are the party of the green new deal, and that must be hardwired into everything we say and do. Businesses, investors and consumers clearly have their role to play, but only a determined lead from government can make this happen. The UK can set an example that leads the world, but only if it is seen to be forging an international alliance to end the climate crisis.As we move forward, we must continue to be the party that opposes austerity, supports common ownership and champions investment in our public services. We need to properly fund and defend our NHS and to make the case for a social care system that tackles the scandalous neglect of older and disabled people.We must argue for radical devolution of power to our nations, regions, towns and cities. Many people across the country are understandably frustrated because decisions are taken about them, without them. We need to break the grip Westminster has over our politics and put decisions in the hands of our communities.There are two parts to being Labour. First, enabling everyone to get a decent education, the best job they can, better standards of living and a fulfilling life. The free market has failed in this endeavour. We have to fight to put wealth, power and opportunity in the hands of all.The second part is just as important. People’s lives don’t always work out the way they want. I have seen this at first hand in all the work I have ever done. Labour should always stand by people. The social security system should be decent, strong and unbreakable, with dignity at its heart. That’s what being Labour means.You can’t tackle injustices, right wrongs or change lives if you don’t win elections. I’m standing to be leader of the Labour party because I want to win. Endless Tory governments are not inevitable. Another future is possible, but we have to come together as a party and as a movement to fight for it.Labour’s values are my values: peace, justice, equality and dignity for all. Labour can win the next election if we hold true to those values, unite as a movement and focus with confidence on the future. And when we win, it will not be for ourselves, it will be for all those communities who need us now more than ever – and everyone who wants to live in a better world.• Keir Starmer is the MP for Holborn and St Pancras and a candidate for the Labour party leadership"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00f0615446872387cf365efc808e8450867a2637/0_162_3977_2386/master/3977.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aca8c3b4fa6ddc8663f6c88ba43a8bc2","title":"learned to love twitter once muted narcissism","story":"Late to the party, I am still mainly lurking, but the microblogging network is illuminating and far from the open sewer I was led to believeI had never been on Twitter but I’d heard a lot about it, chiefly three things.

The general “freedom” they proclaim turns out to mean freedom for billionaires, the City of London, and the tax-avoiding, labour-exploiting, planet-poisoning chancers whose liberty is our captivity. Meanwhile, through further restrictions on housing, benefits, immigration, protest and dissent, they have snatched freedom from those who need it most.Boris Johnson’s government intends to sustain this ignoble tradition. Its consultation document on unauthorised encampments proposes to criminalise the lives of some of Britain’s most vulnerable and persecuted groups. By enabling the police to confiscate the homes of “anyone whom they suspect to be trespassing on land with the purpose of residing on it”, Gypsies, Roma and Travellers will be left with nowhere to stop.But when you examine the proposals more closely, you begin to realise that they don’t stop at the persecution of travelling peoples. The way the questions are framed could enable the government to go much further than the official purpose of the consultation, potentially launching one of the most severe restrictions on general freedom in the modern era.The consultation is everything such exercises are not supposed to be. It is confusing and heavily slanted. It is pitched in such a way that, however you might answer the questions, you are forced to agree with a profoundly illiberal idea.For example, the first question asks: “To what extent do you agree or disagree that knowingly entering land without the landowner’s permission should only be made a criminal offence if it is for the purpose of residing on it?”It’s a perfect trap. If you agree, you consent to the curtailment of the traditional rights and lives of Roma and Travellers. If you disagree, you consent to the criminalisation of something much wider, which, throughout English history has been a civil matter: trespass on land.Is this the intention? To sneak in, under the cloak of a populist attack on a small minority, the criminalisation of walking on the great majority of England’s land? We have a parliament in which, in both houses, landowners are massively over-represented. We have a wider political and economic system in which ancient, landed power still carries immense weight. There is nothing some landowners would like more than to set the police on those who dare to venture into their vast estates. And there is nothing that tells us more clearly that freedom for one is captivity for another.The harder you look, the more disguised powers appear to be lodged in this consultation. Even if new trespass laws are aimed only at those residing on land, they will affect not only Gypsies, Roma and Travellers, but also rough sleepers. David Cameron’s government criminalised squatting in empty homes. This too was previously a civil matter. Thousands of homeless people found themselves on the wrong side of the law. Some have been imprisoned for using property abandoned by its owners. Johnson’s government would do the same to people living in tents or bivvy bags. There will be nowhere to turn.Any new laws are also likely to be used against protesters. We’ve seen how previous legislation – such as the 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act, the 1997 Protection from Harassment Act, the 2000 Terrorism Act and the 2005 Serious Organised Crime and Police Act – has been immediately deployed against peaceful protest, in some cases after the government promised that it would not be used for this purpose. In view of the statements this week by the home secretary, Priti Patel, attempting to justify Extinction Rebellion’s temporary inclusion on a list of extremist ideologies, we cannot trust her to protect our rights to dissent. People seeking to reside on land for the purposes of protest, as anti-fracking and anti-roads campaigners have done to great effect, are likely to be criminalised from the outset.But in casting the illiberal net so wide, the government might accidentally have created a coalition. Rather than allowing Roma, Travellers and homeless people to be picked off, all those of us who fear the criminalisation of trespass should join forces with them, protecting their rights while we defend our own. In responding to the consultation, which closes on 4 March, we should refuse to be trapped in the government’s framing. Instead of agreeing or disagreeing with its proposals, we should state under every confusing question that we reject all attempts to criminalise trespass.History shows that attacks on general freedoms often begin with an attack on the freedom of a minority. It teaches us that we should never allow a government to ide and rule.

But a number of them were uncharacteristically unbothered about the chance to set goals at the start of the new decade. New year resolutions simply are not as relevant to them as they once were, now they are in perpetual pursuit of improvement.The rise of “wellness” and the encroaching culture of public goal-setting means our resolutions start anew not annually but every few days. Healing crystals, luxury water bottles and meditation apps are not the preserve of dippy LA hipsters but the paraphernalia of your average millennial woman. Self-improvement is now integral to our every day what’s a new year resolution when every other month is a Dry January, a Veganuary or a Stoptober?Even my most laissez-faire friends spend a good part of the year living in athleisure and fiddling with fitbits, spurred on by Instagram influencers with expertly hidden high metabolisms.Sure, “wellness” is targeted at everyone, but it’s always women who can afford to be a bit “better” whatever the time of year. And while self-improvement is ultimately mostly positive, social media has a way of making things that are innately fine into a who’s-got-the-most-toned-arms race. Gains made and miles run by others are a constant reminder we can always push harder, celebrity gym selfies proof there is always further to go in the pursuit of perfection. Growth and learning should never stop, but it can feel as if we are in a constant state of yearning instead. The end point is often dictated by pressure, rather than our satisfaction.Sitting at the intersection of self-care and self-help, wellness is a vague enough concept to encompass everything. Betterment means taking better care of yourself, but it also means being a “girl boss” who hustles to “have it all”. It means we must do more but also less: run a bubble bath, run a marathon, run a startup. It means an unspoken competition to see who can be the most frequently “thrilled to announce” a new achievement on Twitter (or the more coy, female-friendly alternative announcement: “So, I did a thing …”). It means burning the (scented) candle at both ends to be your “best self”, undoing any of the good from your clean-eating stint.New year resolutions seem less pressing when every 30 days resets to a new workout plan. If you have already broken yours, don’t sweat it – chances are, you are more than making up for it the rest of the year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b1eb314f346a043ad6d63088778d6db6e17abb8/0_324_4892_2937/master/4892.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ac0d3f9684d9a4384b5ace4ba4390ba","title":"climate emergency 2019 was second hottest year on record","story":"Last decade was also hottest yet in 150 years of measurements, say scientistsThe year 2019 was the second hottest on record for the planet’s surface, according to latest research. The analyses reveal the scale of the climate crisis: both the past five years and the past decade are the hottest in 150 years.The succession of records being broken year after year is “the drumbeat of the Anthropocene”, said one scientist, and is bringing increasingly severe storms, floods, droughts and wildfires.The average temperature in 2019 was about 1.1C above the average from 1850-1900, before large-scale fossil fuel burning began. The world’s scientists have warned that global heating beyond 1.5C will significantly worsen extreme weather and suffering for hundreds of millions of people.The World Economic Forum’s global risk assessment for the next decade, also published on Wednesday, found the top five dangers were all environmental, including extreme weather, failure to prepare for climate change and the destruction of the natural world.“The last decade was easily the warmest decade in the record and is the first decade more than 1C above late 19th-century temperatures,” said Gavin Schmidt, of Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which produced one of the temperature records.“What is important is the totality of evidence from multiple independent data sets that the Earth is warming, that human activity is driving it and the impacts are clearly being felt,” he said. “These announcements might sound like a broken record, but what is being heard is the drumbeat of the Anthropocene.”“It’s now official that we have just completed the warmest decade on record, a reminder that the planet continues to warm as we continue to burn fossil fuels,” said Prof Michael Mann at Penn State University in the US.While instrumental temperature records stretch back to 1850, data from ice cores indicate that today’s temperatures were last seen at least 100,000 years ago. Furthermore, the level of carbon dioxide is the highest it has been for several million years, when the sea level was 15-20 metres higher.The four temperature datasets are compiled from many millions of surface temperature measurements taken across the globe, from all continents and all oceans. They are produced by the UK Met Office with the University of East Anglia (UEA), both Nasa and Noaa in the US, and Europe’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. Small differences between the analyses arise from how data-sparse polar regions are treated, but all agree that the past five years are the warmest five years since each global record began.The Met Office’s forecast for global average temperature for 2020 suggests this year could well set another record and is very likely to be among the top three hottest. The UK government will host a critical UN climate summit in Glasgow in November. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, and many others are urging nations to increase dramatically their pledges to cut carbon emissions, which would  lead to global temperatures rising by a disastrous 3-4C.“It is obvious we are not succeeding in preventing dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, which was the main goal of the original 1992 UN climate change convention,” said Bob Ward, of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics.“Even if we succeed in limiting warming to 1.5C, this would not be a ‘safe’ level of warming for the world,” he said. “Therefore we must focus on cutting global emissions to net zero as soon as possible. We know the transition to a net zero economy is the growth story of the 21st century.”Rosie Rogers, of Greenpeace UK, said: “We’re breaking more records than Usain Bolt, but there are no gold medals for dangerous temperature rises, or the floods and fires that come with it. We cannot run away from the climate emergency.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/784681cbc9abaa291f70cb6d641034c353a3e2c6/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88b1d9044c2370292ee3f0a77c69b1b5","title":"what the five hottest years on earth look like in pictures","story":"The past five years – and the past decade – are the hottest in 150 years, the latest research has shown.

Well, here’s something to prove me wrong. Life during wartime is the theme of this gripping cine-journal from Afghan film-maker Hassan Fazili. Midnight Traveler is his personal film about the gruelling odyssey undertaken by his family as they fled Afghanistan in 2015, making the brutal overland trek through Tajikistan, Iran, Turkey, Bulgaria, Serbia and Hungary on a mission to seek refuge in the European Union. On the way, they face threats of rape and violence, theft and finally abandonment from their unscrupulous smugglers – and racist attacks in Bulgaria. (Hungary, incidentally, is where their unfinished journey ends, and Fazili leaves it up to the audience to ponder just what kind of a reception refugees can expect in that country.)He avowedly shot this whole feature on smartphones – keeping them charged must have been one of his lesser nightmares – and the US-based film-maker and Persian speaker Emelie Mahdahvian edited, produced and arguably co-created this documentary. The result is an unexpectedly great-looking film, virtually a demo reel for all indie film-makers, certainly considering it was just shot on phones, even bearing in mind the post-production work.The act of filming must have been Fazili’s way of managing the ordeal and keeping sane, especially in the long periods of inactivity in the refugee camp. (They were in the Serbian one for a brain-pulverising 475 days.) In its way, it’s a home movie that, like so many others, makes the dad behind the camera a mostly absent figure, privileging images of the wife and children. But his presence breaks through as his wife, Nargis, talks about the religious faith he has mostly grown away from – and yells at him for flirting with other women.

It will be accompanied by a Swinton season, which will include her first film role in Jarman’s film Caravaggio.Swinton said she was “very happy and touched” to be given the honour. “Fellowship and BFI are two of my favourite words … and the beginning and end of the reason I live my life in the cinema in the first place.” She added that she was sharing it with “beloved film-making playmates, living and departed”.The award will be made at an annual dinner hosted by the BFI chair, Josh Berger. He said Swinton continued to enjoy the broadest of careers.“It is a career full of courageous artistic choices that has earned her the deep respect of her peers, our industry, and the admiration and enjoyment of audiences all over the world.“Tilda inhabits the characters she portrays in the most compelling way. Her work is powerful and far ranging and as such occupies a unique place in our collective film history … it captivates young filmmakers and actors, inspiring them to make bolder, braver and more profound work.”The BFI said the award honoured Swinton’s “daringly eclectic and striking talents as a performer and filmmaker” and recognised her contribution to “film culture, independent film exhibition and philanthropy”.Jarman holds an important place in Swinton’s career because she had decided to quit acting before meeting him. After Caravaggio she went on to appear in a further six of Jarman’s feature films, including The Last of England, War Requiem, and Edward II.Some of her most memorable roles include the title role in Sally Potter’s adaptation of Virginia Woolf’s Orlando (1992), the white witch in two Narnia films, and a ruthless lawyer in the 2007 film Michael Clayton, for which she won a best supporting actress Oscar.Her casting as the Ancient One in Marvel’s Doctor Strange was controversial as the character was a Tibetan man in the original comics. Marvel argued that the Ancient One title was not held exclusively by one character but was a moniker passed down through time.The BFI usually appoints fewer than a handful of new fellows each year.

Or at least that is how it would seem from the Hollywood star’s jubilant reaction to his becoming an honorary citizen of the country.“Starting 2020 as an honorary citizen of all of Greece!” the actor, a convert to Greek Orthodoxy, said on social media. “Kronia pola! (more or less, ‘happy year!’). Hanx”After learning on Monday he was among this year’s Oscar nominees for his portrayal of a children’s television personality in his latest film, A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood – his first Academy Award nomination in almost 20 years – there was more good news in the pages of the Greek government gazette.Citing “exceptional services to Greece,” authorities in Athens announced they had decided to not only grant the 63-year-old Hanks Greek citizenship but extend the offer to his wife, the actor-singer Rita Wilson, and their two sons, Chester and Truman.By way of explanation, the newspaper emphasised the help all four had given in assisting the victims of the devastating wildfire that struck the resort town of Mati outside Athens in July 2018.The blaze left 103 dead and dozens horribly burnt. “The Hanks family gave a signal all over the world for immediate relief actions to help our fire-stricken fellow citizens,” said the order originally signed by the Greek president, but also actively pushed by the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis.Under Greek law honorary naturalisation can be bestowed on those “who have provided exceptional services to the country or whose naturalisation serves the public interest”.The family has a year to formally accept the honour, according to the country’s interior ministry.Hanks, by his own admission, is an ardent admirer of all things Hellenic. The star has been visiting the country for years, spending nearly every summer on the Aegean island of Antiparos, where he has a home. Wilson, whose mother is Greek, is believedto have played a crucial role in his decision to co-produce the romantic comedy My Big Fat Greek Wedding with her.Waxing lyrical about Greece after receiving the 2020 Cecil B DeMille lifetime achievement award at the annual Golden Globes earlier this month, he said: “I’ve been Hellenic now for the better part of 32 years. Greece is a haven … the land, the sky, the water, it’s good for the soul. It’s a healing place, particularly if you get into that fabulous, fabulous Greek schedule of sleeping until noon, staying up until three o’clock in the morning and arguing in a taverna until 3am. It’s just the best life one can have.”But the man widely regarded as Hollywood’s most likeable star did have a few reservations about his new status.“Do I have to pay taxes? Or can I just pay cash and avoid all that stuff?” he quipped when the question of his new citizenship was put to him at a press conference following the awards ceremony. “I’m just kidding. It’s been a great honour.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c2e928a20ba9c34e2b235a430610e7566006921/73_188_2276_1365/master/2276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=713e1429286722bae765d4bb6d478482","title":"manchester united wolves fa cup third round replay match report","story":"Manchester United will travel to Liverpool on Sunday in high spirits after this elimination of Wolves. Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side next meet Tranmere Rovers or Watford in the fourth round and can take on their fiercest rival boosted by a second win of the week.Before a below-capacity crowd of 67,075 the contest had dipped following the break but of more concern for United is the injury sustained by Marcus Rashford only 15 minutes after entering as a substitute: the top scorer will have tests to determine his availability for Anfield.Daniel James came close to giving United the best start in an effervescent first half. Juan Mata had shone against Norwich and he was to prove the matchwinner in an impressive performance. His pass put the Welshman away and only a deft hand from the excellent John Ruddy thwarted him having a chance to open the scoring.Raúl Jiménez did fashion a clear sight of Sergio Romero’s goal via a swivel inside United’s area that sent Brandon Williams, Harry Maguire and Nemanja Matic into a different postcode. Adama Traoré had delivered a pinpoint pass to the Mexican striker so this was shaping to be a sublime goal, only for him to hit the ball straight at the United keeper.This was all part of a breathless start that was about to have the latest instalment in the VAR soap opera. Fred and Matic had a farcical mix-up in which the former smacked the ball off the latter into Jiménez’s path. Yet when Maguire went to challenge the ball ricocheted off the striker’s right hand and, though Neto finished, VAR ruled the effort out. While Jiménez was looking the other way and thus had no agency in the action this was the correct adjudication of the regulation.Cue frustration for Wolves and gleeful schadenfreude for the United faithful. The emotions were reversed, though, when a sharp Aaron Wan-Bissaka pass released Anthony Martial only for him to slide to the turf.Next up in this open and entertaining contest was a corner claimed by Jonny. João Moutinho took this short, received the ball back from the No 19, and United were relieved to clear his cross. Later, they had a lucky escape: a Jonny cross was headed by Matt Doherty past Romero but rebounded off his right post. Jiménez looked to pounce on the rebound but was ruled offside.A helter-skelter first half now featured Matic giving the ball away, chasing and winning it back, before igniting an attack that had Martial scampering forward but he could only shoot tamely.A note was passed by Solskjær to Mata and the latter later joked about what this concerned. “It was a list of grocery shopping, bread milk and other things,” he said.Solskjær was more revealing. “A couple of times we went out of shape – we adjusted it for five-10 minutes before half-time,” the Norwegian said.Each manager’s instructions for the second half will have been similar: tighten up at the back and be more ruthless when opportunity knocked.Solskjær had Rashford warming up and the 22-year-old had a front‑seat view from the touchline of James firing past Ruddy and coming close to breaking the deadlock.Any control for United came via Matic and Fred in midfield though the home team were still vulnerable when Wolves wrested back possession, moved forward and worked the ball to the eager Jiménez. But he, again, missed with an attempt from an angle.Quality had taken a downturn. Even Kevin Friend seemed affected, the referee showing Neto a yellow card when Williams appeared to jump over his leg rather than be felled by it. Yet the left-back did impress with a show of muscular, pacy defending that took him back alongside Neto as he sprinted into the area, the 19-year-old dispossessing the winger and clearing danger while drawing applause from his goalkeeper Romero.On 65 minutes Solskjær removed James for Rashford and Greenwood for Andreas Pereira. And now, at last, Mata struck: the playmaker ran on to a Martial through ball and expertly chipped Ruddy. Mata said: “I had a lot of time and it’s not good, better not to have time when you are facing a goalkeeper.”Nuno Espírito Santo, Wolves’ manager, said: “I am disappointed to go out because it is frustrating when you perform well and go out.” For United there is momentum heading into Sunday’s trip to Merseyside."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fc5a99f79691a8f0a00aaa84dc15d00433244d2/0_111_3351_2010/master/3351.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5cbe6fa48952e0bd9eeaec5ed7218783","title":"premier league european football profit boom","story":"The clubs in the top isions of European football were financially profitable overall for the second year running in 2017‑18 and far less saddled with debt than before financial fair play rules were introduced in 2011, according to continent-wide analysis conducted by Uefa.The annual “benchmarking” report produced by European football’s governing body recorded generally booming attendances, TV income and commercial revenues across all leagues, but Uefa also sounded a warning about the widening financial and competitive gap between the richest elite clubs and the rest.The report assessed the 2017-18 financial reports from all 712 clubs in the top isions of Uefa’s 54 European member countries and found the Premier League has dramatically cemented its dominance over all other leagues during the past decade.Uefa’s analysts found the combined revenues of the 20 Premier League clubs, €5.4bn, was more money than the 617 clubs in all 50 European leagues below the top four. The gap between the Premier League and the next wealthiest and most powerful leagues is also vast, its clubs making €2bn more than the Bundesliga, whose members made €3.2bn, and La Liga (€3.1bn), with Serie A clubs having earned €2.3bn and France’s Ligue 1 €1.7bn, a third of the Premier League’s total earnings.Ceferin described the improved financial landscape as “a testament to the success of FFP regulations, the stable European football ecosystem and sustained and sensible investment”. But he also cautioned about “threats” to the game’s stability: “These include the risks of globalisation-fuelled revenue polarisation, of a fragmenting media landscape, and of cases of over-dependence on transfer activity revenue. “The report also shows that European club football is strong, united and resilient, and I am certain that European football can and will overcome these challenges and others just as successfully as it dealt with the threat of spiralling losses in the recent past.”For several years Uefa under Ceferin has raised concerns about the game’s widening financial gap, and the concentration of success among an elite group of clubs, without so far achieving any agreement on whether or how it can be closed. Uefa’s strategy document for 2019 until the new football calendar is agreed in 2024 states that improving “competitive balance” is a core aim, for which “specific regulations” need to be developed, but the realistic possibilities are still being worked on at the organisation’s Swiss headquarters. Pressure from the major European clubs is in the opposite direction, for more lucrative Champions League matches from a reshaping of the competition after 2024, and there is very little talk of redistributing money more equally.Uefa’s analysis found Manchester City spent more on transfers for Pep Guardiola during the 2017-18 financial year, €282m, when they signed players including Kyle Walker (£45m), Benjamin Mendy (£52m) and Aymeric Laporte (£57m), than any other club in football history. Manchester United, who spent €223m during that period, including £75m for Romalu Lukaku and £40m for Nemanja Matic, are cited as having also broken the record for the most money spent annually on signing players, €221m by Real Madrid in 2008-09.United, still carrying borrowings and other financial charges loaded on the Glazer family since they took over the club in 2005, had the highest net debt in Europe, at €568m. Tottenham had the next highest net debt, €483m, due to the investment and cost of building their new stadium."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a0603940f0fbddf9c179bc74777d654f74ab09f/149_261_2512_1508/master/2512.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9e3823d2c14786b8527f44a4f2893d1","title":"manchester united wolves fa cup third round replay live","story":"Juan Mata scored the only goal of a tight match to set up a fourth-round tie with either Tranmere or WatfordAnyway, that’s your lot.

End to end, an open game, we wanted to control the game. But you don’t get an easier draw in the next round if you win 4-0, so 1-0 is enough. We finally beat Wolverhampton. Mata is different class, he has the skill and composure ... and even the pace to get through there!” A cheeky grin there. And the note? “I thought we went out of shape so I adjusted it for five to ten minutes before half time.” As for Marcus Rashford? “Yeah, that backfired, but you have to go for them once in a while. Seems like he’s got a knock there and couldn’t run. Let’s test him in the next couple of days, and hopefully he’ll be OK for Sunday. He has struggled with a knock on his back, and got another one there.” And finally, is there any transfer news? “No updates.” Another cheeky smile.A sour note for Vinagre, who appears to have pulled a hamstring in the final stages. He’s down getting treatment. Wolves have now played 38 games this season, and this is maybe the cost. With their Europa League campaign in mind, perhaps an early exit from the FA Cup will be seen as a blessing in disguise ... once the pain of defeat subsides, of course. So close to the final last year they’ll have to wait at least another season to scratch that 60-year itch. Meanwhile Ole Gunnar Solskjaer almost levitates down the tunnel, gliding along serenely, still dreaming of United’s 13th FA Cup and his first bit of silverware as manager of the club.United have done enough! Just. Not a classic, not their best performance, but getting through is all that matters. They’ll meet either Tranmere Rovers or Watford thanks to a lovely goal by Juan Mata.90 min +4: Wolves send it upfield. Martial takes up possession and brings it back towards their box. He sets up Pereira, who curls weakly into Ruddy’s arms. But that should be enough.90 min +3: Maguire hooks it into the corner. The clock ticks on. Eventually Martial is caught offside. Wolves have one chance to hit this long and take United to extra time.90 min +2: Jimenez clatters into Maguire. A garden-variety free kick in the midfield. Maguire takes the opportunity to run down the clock as he prepares to take.90 min +1: The resulting corner is an overly intricate non-event. Buur is eventually flagged offside. This all happens in the first of four additional minutes.90 min: Buur busies himself down the right and slips a pass into the box for Dendoncker, who crosses and hits Lindelof on the forearm. Wolves want a penalty, but Lindelof had made no move towards the ball, his arm wasn’t in an unnatural position, and the pair were too close anyway, the defender with no time to react.88 min: Oskar Buur, a 21-year-old Danish defender, comes on for Traore. He’s making his FA Cup debut.86 min: Jimenez dances down the right and reaches the byline. His chipped cross is an inch too high for Gibbs-White, free in the middle, six yards out. Old Trafford collectively catches its breath.85 min: Martial wins a corner down the left off Neves. Pereira’s hard-hit corner is flicked on by Matic at the near post, but there’s nobody there to bundle the ball home.84 min: Vinagre dribbles down the middle. United are backpedalling, and he’s got options either side. So he takes his eye off the ball ... and steps on it, mid-flight. United clear their lines, and Dendoncker is booked for a frustrated check on Fred.82 min: Doherty works his way down the left and wins a corner off Lindelof. Moutinho takes. With the six-yard box crammed with players, he pulls one back for Neves, alone on the edge of the box. Neves aims for the top left, but while it’s not the worst effort, it’s always going high and wide. 80 min: The tension at Old Trafford is palpable. A big ten minutes, plus stoppages, coming up for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.79 min: Nope, Rashford is down again, struggling, holding his back. He’s able to get up and walk off down the tunnel, to be replaced by Jesse Lingard.78 min: Traore’s cross from the right is brought down by Jimenez, ten yards out and level with the left-hand post. But he can’t sort his feet out. For a second, it looked as though Wolves had opened United up.77 min: But Rashford is made of strong stuff, and he’s back up, determined to continue. United will hope that’s just a sore knock picked up when coming together with Doherty, rather than anything more serious.76 min: Rashford is down, shaking his head and holding his lower back. This doesn’t look good for United’s star striker, especially with the north-west derby at Anfield looming on Sunday.75 min: Before the free kick can be taken, Vinagre replaces Jonny. Moutinho’s delivery is cleared by Maguire, dealing with the problem he caused himself.74 min: Wolves get the free kick here, though, as Maguire scythes Jimenez with a sliding tackle from behind. That’s as agricultural as it gets, an obvious booking and free kick.73 min: Lindelof and Traore crash into each other as the pair chase a long ball down the Wolves right. Traore wants a free kick in a dangerous position, but it’s deemed a 50-50 shoulder challenge and we play on.71 min: That was Neto’s last contribution. He’s replaced by the promising Morgan Gibbs-White, sent on by Nuno to make his name in the cup.70 min: Wolves try to hit back immediately, Neto jigging his way down the right and drawing a couple of players. He should slip Traore free down the middle, but overhits his diagonal dink and it’s a goal kick.68 min: There’s a ludicrous wait as VAR sticks its unwanted neb in. A check for offside. But Mata was clearly on. In the dugout, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wears the wide grin of a cream-enhanced cat.Doherty strips Pereira with ease and powers down the right. He enters the box, dances along the touchline, but is robbed by Maguire. United counter. Martial drifts in from the left and dinks a ball down the middle, with Wolves light at the back. Mata draws Ruddy, and chips the keeper elegantly to break the deadlock!66 min: United push Wolves back, though they’re not sure how to open them up in the final third. Eventually Wan-Bissaka bursts down the right, and hooks a cross into the mixer. Unfortunately for United, nobody in red has taken a chance and there’s nobody in the middle. All a bit static up front for the hosts.64 min: Greenwood and James are replaced by Pereira and Rashford. United take a short free kick and tippy-tap it about in the midfield.63 min: Moutinho skittles Fred, 35 yards out. But before the free kick can be taken, United prepare a double change ...61 min: Neto nearly bursts clear down the right. He enters the box, but can’t shake off his nemesis Williams, the young defender staying strong and earning a huge cheer from the home faithful as he eventually wins possession and clears the danger. He’s a real prospect, this lad.59 min: Neto is booked for a late slide on Williams. He can have no complaints, but makes one anyway, in the theatrical manner.58 min: Traore turns on the jets and speeds past Wan-Bissaka down the left. He nearly gets past Maguire, too, but the defender toe-pokes the ball out of his road. Just in time, because Traore would have been in on goal.56 min: Fred clips Traore’s heel as the Wolves winger whips through the centre circle. Just a free kick, but the United midfielder, already in the book, wants to watch himself here. Another one of those could test the ref’s patience.55 min: Neto sails past a static Maguire, down the right. He stands one up for Jimenez in the middle. Lindelof does well to read the danger and head clear. United continue to give up chances.54 min: Neves launches a shot towards the train tracks. Miles over the bar. 52 min: Much better from United! Martial works down the left and checks back. He rolls back up the wing for Williams, who plays a cute reverse pass down the channel to release James into the area. James sends a low fizzer across Ruddy and inches wide of the right-hand post. A lovely move.50 min: Traore makes good down the left. His cross is no good. United play out from the back. Fred plays yet another poor pass, a short backwards fluff that nearly lets Traore in down the left. Lindelof steps in and mops up.49 min: Wolves are sitting deep, and United don’t seem too sure what to do. Martial, Greenwood and James aren’t moving, the midfield have few options. Eventually Mata has a rasp from 25 yards, hoping to find the top right. Easy for Ruddy. A few grumbles from the home support as United toil.48 min:  Ruddy launches long. Jimenez nearly gets in down the right, but Romero comes out of his box to deal with the danger. Not for the first time either. 47 min: A quiet start to the second half as United stroke the ball around the back, and an atmosphere at an under-capacity Old Trafford to match.United get the second half underway. They’re now kicking towards the Stretford End. No changes.Three halves of football, and still no goals between these two. Neto, who had one disallowed, theatrically cocks his head back and wails at the stars for the benefit of the half-time cameras. Still no real idea which way this tie will turn. We’ll find out soon enough, even if we need extra time and penalties. No flipping!45 min: Fred dinks a cute pass down the inside right for Mata, who would have been one on one but for Dendoncker’s extended leg, hooking into the air. Greenwood can’t bring the ball down in the Wolves area, and the flag goes up for offside anyway.44 min: Back up the other end, Williams winning a corner off Doherty on the left. Mata takes, but doesn’t beat the first man. Wolves clear. Jonny and Williams collide on the halfway line, and grab a chunk of each other’s shirt. For a second it looks like properly kicking off, but the ref’s in quickly to defuse the situation and the pair clasp hands amiably enough. There’s nice.42 min: James breaks down the inside-left channel, racing after Greenwood’s pass from deep, and warms Ruddy’s hands with a powerful shot. Wolves break up the other end, Jonny reaching a deep position on the left, but failing to find a man in the middle. Moutinho tries again, but crosses too deep in looking for Doherty at the far post. Goal kick.40 min: This is better, though, Fred dribbling with purpose down the right and winning a corner off Saiss. Mata plays it short. A couple of slow passes by Fred and Williams, then James wins United a second go. This one is hung up for Ruddy to claim easily. A little better.39 min: Not much of a cup atmosphere right now. The travelling Wolves fans making the most noise at the minute. United haven’t done too much to get the home faithful going.37 min: Mata has finished reading Ole’s note. He furrows his brow, looking a bit confusedconcerned. Another lesson at half-time might be required. In other admin news, Fred is booked for repeated fouling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/add289ae8e48c4563530381a07651c676b606a3c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=299eba58bc9440d16234841a2f032fd5","title":"how vegetarianism is going back to its roots in africa","story":"Health and climate concerns are behind the growth of plant-based diets which were once prevalent on the continentIn the meat-loving capital of Burkina Faso, customers at a small roadside joint eat bean balls, grilled tofu skewers and peanut butter rice while a report about chickens unfit for consumption being dumped on the street airs on the midday news.A sign above the door proudly welcomes customers: “Vegetarian restaurant Nasa. Food for the love of health.” In Ouagadougou’s first plant-based restaurant, there are no knives on the tables.The place is full of regular customers who greet Christine Tapsoba, the owner, like an old friend. But it wasn’t always like this. “At the start, it wasn’t easy. People thought it was weird, they didn’t know how we could make food without using meat,” she says. “Some days, we could open the restaurant and sell nothing.”In the years since Nasa opened in 2004, her clientele has grown exponentially, drawn in initially by giveaways of her popular barbecued tofu skewers.Plant-based diets have also spread across the west, with vegan restaurants and products seeing meteoric rises in sales. But global meat consumption is still increasing, with burgeoning urban middle classes across Africa, Asia and Latin America powering the demand.Across Africa, a growing number of plant-based restaurants are following in Tapsoba’s footsteps in response to health and environmental challenges. Happy Cow, an app that helps vegetarians and vegans find places to eat around the world, lists more than 900 restaurants with vegan options across Africa. More than half of these were added in the past two years. Thirty fully vegan restaurants have been listed since the start of 2018.South Africa has been at the forefront of this push, with veganism booming in Cape Town and Johannesburg. Cities such as Nairobi in Kenya, and Accra in Ghana, today boast a dozen meat-free restaurants. In Dakar, the Senegalese capital, upmarket seaside restaurants are quickly adding salad bowls and aubergine sandwiches to their otherwise meat- and fish-filled menus.The continent is also at the forefront of some of the challenges veganism hopes to ease. Conditions such as heart disease and cancer have now overtaken infectious diseases such as cholera and measles to become the biggest drain on Africa’s economies, according to the World Health Organization. Much of the continent is already feeling the effects of the climate crisis – a common reason for reducing meat intake – as more regular and unpredictable droughts and floods wreak havoc for farmers and regularly claim lives.Many of its advocates, however, argue that veganism is not a new trend – it is simply a return to traditional African diets. “I particularly think it’s important to spread veganism around Africa because it originated in Africa,” says Nicola Kagoro, a chef working in South Africa and Zimbabwe. “Our ancestors didn’t eat as much meat. It is through colonisation that we learned these crazy meat-eating practices.” Kagoro founded the African Vegan on a Budget movement to show Africans vegan diets can be affordable and filling. She also cooks for female vegan armed rangers group the Akashinga, who fight elephant poaching in Zimbabwe.In research on the world’s healthiest diets, published in the Lancet in 2015, west African countries such as Mali, Chad, Senegal and Sierra Leone, which boasted diets rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains, topped the list. Ethiopian cuisine relies on plant-based foods such as the sourdough flatbread injera, lentils and beans, and many of the country’s Orthodox Christians take part in regular fasts during which meals are served without any animal products.Still, the trend is slow to take hold. “It’s hard to spread the vegan practice around Africa because Africans love their meat,” says Kagoro, who is known as Chef Cola. “The challenge is because Africans think meat is a form of showing wealth.”With Nasa, Tapsoba helps the few Burkinabe vegetarians of Ouagadougou navigate an often difficult path to a meat-free life. “When a vegetarian is here and I am told they struggle to find something to eat, immediately I rise up to help them,” she says.And with patience, free tofu, and a growing awareness of the consequences of meaty diets, she hopes to convince others to join her."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ced4a9d967c8e14a9cab5a12ac70fb36a3924f38/287_152_4818_2890/master/4818.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85f3635d3d5518919c89a62438e06e31","title":"a heavy topic how to change the way your family speaks about weight","story":"While the body positivity movement is making inroads in the media, for many an obsession with thinness begins at homeWeight bias is as prevalent in today’s society as diet plans. And detox teas. And the celebrities who promote diet plans and detox teas.When we experience weight stigma – and I’m not talking about being fat, I’m talking about feeling as if you’re too fat – it puts us at risk of disordered eating, makes us avoid exercise (especially in public), worsens our physical and mental health, and even limits our future employment opportunities.While the mainstream media, the beauty industry, social media and health professionals’ weight bias all play their role in the macrocosm of body negativity, sometimes the most powerful influences are from those closest to us.In particular, parents have an impact not only on their children’s body image but also that of their children’s children. A healthy attitude to one’s body is a struggle to achieve even without the family baggage of body image issues.Throw snide remarks from relatives into the mix and you have a situation that can not only be difficult for children, but also trigger parents’ weight concerns as they relive diet trauma from their own childhoods.So for parents who are struggling with this all-too-common challenge, here are some ideas for filtering out the body negativity that can sometimes go along with free babysitting. Your parents are so used to telling you what to do, and can become so fixed in their ways, that it can be really hard to get through to them. Without trying, they can see your comments through the lens of their (probably weight-biased) belief system, and also their judgments of your belief system (let’s face it, counter-diet-culture ideas are still pretty new to people and far from widely embraced).The way to cut through this is to go really deep. Be vulnerable and show them the real feelings going on underneath any anger or frustration. As they love you and (presumably) want what’s best for you, this can be surprisingly powerful. If you feel they are safe to be vulnerable with, have the deep and meaningful conversation. Don’t make them out to be the bad guy and try to shift your focus from the transgressions of the past to the possibilities of the future.Sometimes (for a million reasons) the big sit-down chat won’t (or doesn’t) work. In this case, set up some clear rules for your house and kids. Your parents probably set rules with you, so they know how rules work. And if your parents don’t understand (or agree with) the underlying principles, sometimes you need to be extra clear about the actions themselves. Rules may sound something like, “We don’t talk about weight in our house,” or, “In our family, the parents provide the food and the kids decide what they’ll eat.” Rules may require constant reminders (“Mum, Anna’s fine to eat some of that. Anna, you enjoy it, darling!”) or have reasonable consequences, such as, “When you mention my child’s weight, either you leave or we do.”Despite your heart-to-hearts and rules, some parents just won’t play ball. If you perceive your parents’ actions are really damaging, you may choose to limit contact with them for this reason. The contact that remains can provide a good real-time learning opportunity to educate kids about society’s corrosive messages, and how to deal with them. “That’s just Grandpa – when he grew up there wasn’t a lot of food around, so he gets really upset when people leave food on their plate. In our time we have too much food, so it’s OK to leave it if you’ve had enough.”It can also be a great opportunity to build resilience: “I know Grandma said you’re getting a little tummy, and that made you feel upset, but Grandma is a bit old and she sometimes says silly things – it doesn’t mean it’s true or we have to worry too much about it.”However you approach these sometimes challenging conversations, be sure to do it with kindness, empathy and understanding. No one’s ever open to accepting feedback when they’re being hammered, and modelling good communication is the best way to encourage someone else to play ball.Social change happens because people need it to, and elevated conversations really do have the power to create a better society. These conversations may not only help you and your children, but their children and the children of generations to come. After all, racism, homophobia and sexism are all – to varying degrees – dying slow intergenerational deaths … why not fat phobia too?• This is an edited extract from Thinsanity: Seven Steps to Transform Your Mindset and Say Goodbye to Dieting Forever by Glenn Mackintosh, out now through Hachette Australia"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2ba09ed0103fbdda4c38fda0b719710b4323b80/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4784e9b3be0a2ee0c23fe230e47be21","title":"bbc plans to open new tech hub in newcastle says tony hall","story":"Director general says two thirds of BBC staff will be based outside of London by 2027The BBC is planning to open a new tech hub in Newcastle as part of a wider plan to ensure two-thirds of its staff are based outside of London by 2027, its director general has said.Tony Hall announced the plan for the new hub in the north-east of England on Wednesday to develop the technology that underpins the iPlayer and BBC Sounds services it hopes will lure young audiences back to the broadcaster. At the moment about half of the BBC’s staff are employed in the capital, suggesting the corporation intends to move around 3,000 roles out of the capital in the coming years.The decision to use Hall’s start-of-year speech to emphasise increased regional spending chimes with the Conservative government’s pledge to “level up” parts of the country by pushing institutions to move jobs outside London.Hall said Newcastle is “a city looking for fresh ideas, collaboration and innovation, with two highly successful universities and a digital cluster growing faster than any area outside London”. He pledged to hire a new group of software engineers, designers, product developers and data scientists to develop streaming services in the BBC’s existing Newcastle office, although senior technology managers are likely to remain in London and the corporation did not confirm how many developers will be based in the north.The director general also trailed other investment outside of London, which will see the production arm BBC Studios boost staffing levels at its natural history unit in Bristol, while more BBC Sounds staff will move from London to Salford to work with the service’s newly appointed controller Jonathan Wall.The BBC is facing a battle with the government to secure its financial future after an election campaign that saw the corporation’s news output battered by accusations of bias from all sides of the political spectrum. Although the existence of the licence fee funding model is guaranteed for the next seven years, BBC executives are already looking ahead to the forthcoming negotiations with the government which will set the amount it can charge for the licence fee from 2022 onwards.In addition, after the Conservatives’ landslide victory, ministers commissioned a review that will look at decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee and turning it into a civil offence. Previous studies have concluded that such a move could cost the BBC hundreds of millions of pounds of funding due to increased non-payment by members of the public.During the election campaign Boris Johnson said he did not intend to abolish the licence fee but suggested it was increasingly anachronistic, telling an audience in Washington that “you have to ask yourself whether that kind of approach to funding a TV media organisation still makes sense in the long term given the way other media organisations manage to fund themselves”.Since returning to power, the Conservatives have pulled ministers from political shows such as the Today programme, while prioritising more general interest programmes such as BBC Breakfast.Hall also told staff on Wednesday that he wanted to double the BBC’s global audience to a billion people every week by 2030, with a suggestion that ministers could provide extra funding to help the broadcaster expand around the world: “The previous government backed the World Service with new funding, and I look forward to working with this government too.”He also pledged a year of stories focused on the climate crisis in the run-up to the Glasgow climate conference. He said: “Nobody has done more than the BBC to highlight the challenges of climate change,” and promised to look at ways to make the corporation carbon neutral."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92c20397293d36761dd670a3ae634943b39f84fa/0_342_3920_2352/master/3920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c9e54d3e656c0efa4023e13140da080","title":"lso rattle roschmann review symphony hall birmingham berg beethoven","story":"Symphony Hall, BirminghamSoprano Dorothea Röschmann savoured every word of Berg’s Early Songs and Rattle was in his element, but this programme ultimately felt over controlledThroughout this 250th-anniversary year conductors will doubtless come up with any number of ingenious ways of performing Beethoven’s music alongside that of other composers. Simon Rattle’s opening gambit is to pair it with Berg. On Sunday he will precede a rare performance of the oratorio Christ on the Mount of Olives with Berg’s Violin Concerto, while in this programme with the London Symphony Orchestra three early Berg works were followed by Beethoven’s 7th Symphony.Since leaving the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in 1998, Rattle’s returns to Symphony Hall have been special events, and there was a very enthusiastic near-capacity audience for this one, too. But it was not quite the memorable, revelatory experience some might have anticipated, even though the LSO were on top form, as they invariably are for their music director.The real treat came first with Berg’s Seven Early Songs, in which the young composer’s efforts – written before he studied with Schoenberg, and revealing Richard Strauss as just as important an influence as Mahler – are reflected through the mature composer’s sound world. The soprano soloist was Dorothea Röschmann, savouring every word in the most lustrous honeyed tones, and Rattle was in his element refining the orchestral textures around her.Preceded by an unfinished Passacaglia, which is all that survives of a projected symphony that Berg began writing just before them, the Three Orchestral Pieces were impressive from a technical viewpoint, too, with every morsel of this teeming score exactly where it should be. But the result lacked the cataclysmic power that some conductors find in these pieces everything was just a bit too civilised, a bit too controlled.The Beethoven puzzled too. Though the finale was driven with almost manic intensity, with an over-prominent timpani leading the way, the earlier movements had sometimes been lacking in momentum, missing direction in the opening Vivace, over-moulded in the second movement Allegretto. It sometimes seemed almost routine, rarely a word one associates with a Rattle performance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/612650666facab7182722f84dc82f8f4aa58003d/0_194_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16dfa16e20635af3ef17e4a7f3a02684","title":"why did former nissan boss carlos ghosn choose a life on the run podcast","story":"The former CEO of Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, was once one of Japan’s most respected business people.

That will be really cool because we can get to see the black hole feeding in action.”The first of the unusual objects (later named G1) showed up on an astronomical survey in 2005 and was thought to be an astronomical anomaly until a second, similar object, G2, was spotted by German astronomers in 2012.“We had seen it before, but it didn’t look too peculiar until it got close to the black hole and became elongated, and much of its gas was torn apart,” said Ghez. “It went from being a pretty innocuous object when it was far from the black hole to one that was really stretched out and distorted at its closest approach and lost its outer shell, and now it’s getting more compact again.”Ghez and her research team believe that G2 is probably the product of a merger of two stars that had been orbiting the black hole in tandem before morphing into an extremely large star, cloaked in unusually thick gas and dust.G2 is in an eccentric orbit about the Milky Way’s black hole, Sagittarius A*, which has a mass equivalent to more than 4 million suns. When it reached its closest approach in 2014, observations revealed its outer shell being stripped off and swept down the cosmic sinkhole.“When that happens, it might be able to produce an impressive fireworks show since the material eaten by the black hole will heat up and emit copious radiation before it disappears across the event horizon,” said Mark Morris, a co-author and UCLA professor of physics and astronomy.At the time, G2 was thought to be simply a large, diffuse cloud of gas, but astronomers were surprised to find that the object survived its close encounter with the black hole, suggesting that it must have a dense star-like interior.The latest findings, based on 13 years of observations by the WM Keck Observatory in Hawaii, reveal a further four objects in similar orbits, all of which are within a few light months of the Milky Way’s central black hole. By contrast, the Earth is 26,000 light years away.“The Earth is in the suburbs compared to the centre of the galaxy,” Ghez said. “The centre of our galaxy has a density of stars a billion times higher than our part of the galaxy. The gravitational pull is so much stronger. The magnetic fields are more extreme. The centre of the galaxy is where extreme astrophysics occurs.”The findings are published in the journal Nature."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c555fa55a2c53fbe5b685451646b8d010402aee7/0_182_4141_2485/master/4141.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fb15b2e4a00b6dc9a0d5668ae50c169","title":"england south africa third test conditions vic marks","story":"The situation has improved markedly for England. Before the Centurion and Cape Town Tests there were not really any selection meetings. Instead there was a head count to assess whether there were 11 fit men to send out on to the field.But in Port Elizabeth, despite the fact Jofra Archer withdrew from the net session on the eve of the match after bowling no more than a dozen deliveries, there remain a few options, which is what captains and coaches always say they prefer. This is probably true most of the time although just occasionally a benefit can be spied when there are no choices available it means no mistakes can be made.In this case the discussion has centred on England’s preferred bowling attack. They have decided to delay making a final choice until Thursday morning to allow themselves one last chance to assess how strong the relevant bowlers are looking and, of course, to stare at the pitch. With Archer all but ruled out the choice is between Mark Wood and Chris Woakes for the final pace bowling slot.Staring at the playing surface was a futile exercise since it was covered by a tarpaulin to protect it not from rain but a fierce sun. England must be wary that the pitch will become too dry, which is the state of most of the Eastern Cape. Beyond the cricketing fraternity the locals are eager for rain.It is expected to be very hot for a couple of days. Hence there is much talk of the possibility of reverse swing at a ground that rarely produces the same bounce as elsewhere in South Africa. Right next to the Test pitch is an old wicket that is very bare, which is considered ideal for bouncing the ball in to the keeper. Such a process may rough up one side of the ball quickly and this enhances the possibility of the reverse swing that modern teams depend on and talk about in equal measure.This may well influence selection and it seems to enhance the chances of Wood playing. When last sighted in the middle he was adept at reverse-swinging the ball at pace. The last Test he played was in St Lucia in February last year when he achieved career-best figures of five for 41 from only 8.2 overs the problem is that he has not played a red-ball game since. In that Test, which resulted in a handsome England victory by 232 runs, he was required to bowl only 20.2 overs. The workload is likely to be much greater at St George’s Park even though this venue now has a habit of producing results. Wood’s last match of any sort was the World Cup final on 14 July.In another era it would be unthinkable that Wood should be tossed into the team without any cricket outside of a net. However modern players do not regard this as an insurmountable hurdle nor do selectors. Moreover Wood supporters point out he had not bowled in the middle for two months before his pace rocked West Indies. So is an 11-month absence anything to worry about? We may be about to find out but there is no denying his selection would be a major risk.Then there is Woakes, whose name has not been on the tip of many tongues going into the Test, especially when the yearning for the X-factor is mentioned. Woakes provides the safer option since he has taken more wickets and scored more runs than any of the other contenders.He can hardly be described as the elephant in the room but no one has been talking about him. In his favour is the fact he last played in a Test as recently as 3 December, in New Zealand, a mere six weeks ago. In the end it is more about how they play than who they play. Even so the decision on the final pace bowler will keep them agonising.Joe Root has decided he will play a spinner and that will be Dom Bess, who was miserly with the ball in Cape Town, which made it so much easier for the captain to juggle his attack. Perhaps South Africa were too cautious against him at Newlands and they may change their approach. This may disrupt Root’s plans, although it could also enhance Bess’s chances of more wickets.It is remarkable that Bess should find himself playing his second Test of the winter but he will be up for it. There is also the possibility if the sun continues to beat down that the ball may turn a little more than in Cape Town.South Africa may change their team as well even though Faf du Plessis has been keen to emphasise their fighting spirit in the Cape Town defeat. On a slower surface Du Plessis may wish to sharpen up his attack by playing another 30-year-old debutant, Dane Paterson, rather than Dwaine Pretorius. That is another ticklish decision but before this game Du Plessis’s biggest worry may relate to his own contributions with the bat, which have been paltry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37172fa6f754807541f7308dae6a12cd963614e4/0_77_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=993c43e523b023842eafe6c56ee8a2bf","title":"luke kuechly retirement concussions","story":"The abrupt retirement of the magnificently talented Carolina Panthers linebacker serves as a reminder we are all complicit in the trauma that football inflicts on playersLuke Kuechly, the magnificently talented Carolina Panthers linebacker who has announced his retirement at the age of 28, gave fans much to savour in his shortened career. It often seemed he was covering the entire field on his own, popping up everywhere to smother a running back or chase down the opposition’s star quarterback. If he wasn’t the best linebacker of his generation, he was close enough that it didn’t matter and the dizzying list of accomplishments during his shortened career speaks for itself: 2012 defensive rookie of the year, 2013 defensive player of the year, five All-Pro first teams, seven Pro Bowls, a Super Bowl appearance, league leading tackler twice, the leading overall tackler in the NFL since his debut for the Panthers nearly eight years ago. By all accounts, he was a gentleman off the field too, and the warm tributes of those who played with him, and against him, are a testament to that.However, despite Kuechly’s myriad accomplishments, the most enduring single image of his career will not be of him taking down a quarterback or his appearance in Super Bowl 50. Instead, it will be of Kuechly being carted off the field in tears after suffering a concussion against the New Orleans Saints in 2016. His game was based on delivering crushing blows to opponents, exactly the kind of calculated violence that helps make the NFL America’s most popular league, and also makes the audience – and I include myself as a journalist and a fan – complicit in the trauma the game inflicts on players. After all, if there’s no audience, there’s no NFL.Kuechly has never spoken about why he was in tears that day, but what we as fans saw and what it said about the public’s changing relationship with football is important. Already that season Kuechly’s teammate Cam Newton had been on the receiving end of a brutal series of tackles worrying enough for the quarterback’s father, Cecil, to wonder about the game’s effect on his son’s health. “I’m thinking about Cam Newton being healthy today, tomorrow and 25 or 35 years from now,” he said. Kuechly was a fierce competitor and his tears against the Saints may have been of disappointment at leaving his teammates behind on the field. They may have been caused by the swing of emotions that can come in the immediate aftermath of a concussion. But many wondered if his thousand-yard stare was that of a man thinking about the effects of the game on his future.Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a condition that can cause mood swings, depression, suicidal thoughts and memory loss, was found in 110 of 111 former football players in a 2017 study (in mitigation, CTE can only be diagnosed after death and it’s reasonable to assume families who suspected their loved one was suffering from the condition are more likely to have participated in the study). In any case, Kuechly is aware of football’s risks. “I think when you play a contact sport there’s always inherent risk and inherent risk to injury,” Kuechly told ESPN in 2017. “At what point do you tolerate it, and at what point is it enough? There’s been a lot of studies and a lot of different literature on concussion and head trauma and that kind of deal, and I think it’s a new subject that we’re constantly learning more and more about.”In his retirement statement, Kuechly did not say concussions were behind his decision to step away from the game, instead stating that “I still want to play, but I don’t think it’s the right decision”. He did, however, suffer three concussions in three seasons although most scientists agree that it is repetitive subconcussive impacts from repeated hits that a tackling machine like Kuechly specialises in that cause lasting damage to players."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70fc01cc941700c397be9633daea26d6529fb97b/0_85_3324_1995/master/3324.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb2b49dcda898d2e7828b28fdb4bd8fa","title":"stuart hogg scotland gregor townsend six nations","story":"• Andy Farrell names five uncapped players in squad• Hogg named Scotland captain by coach TownsendJohnny Sexton has been appointed Ireland captain for the Six Nations, while new head coach, Andy Farrell, has named five uncapped players in his 35-man squad.Sexton takes on the role following the retirement of veteran Rory Best. The fly-half, who has won 88 caps, has not played since suffering a knee injury playing for Leinster in early December but, according to his club side, is making “good progress” in his recovery. The 34-year-old’s only previous experience of captaining his country came in October during the World Cup pool stage win over Russia.“We have appointed Johnny as captain for the Six Nations Championship, you can see what it means to him and the enthusiasm he will bring to the role,” said Farrell. “He has been developing as a leader for a number of years with Ireland, Leinster and the Lions and he will be a positive voice for the group.”Sexton said: “First of all it’s a massive honour to be asked to do it and I obviously got a taste for it during the World Cup for that one game and I’ve done it in patches with Ireland in-game when either Rory or Pete have gone off in previous games. It’s something that I enjoy but ultimately it’s a huge honour, the biggest honour of my career to be asked to do it and I’m really looking forward to it and looking forward to the challenges that are coming up and hopefully we can have a successful Six Nations.”Leinster trio Ronan Kelleher, Caelan Doris and Max Deegan are among the potential Test debutants selected for the tournament, along with Ulster pair Billy Burns and Tom O’Toole. Ireland begin with a home match against Scotland on 1 February.Meanwhile, Gregor Townsend has backed Stuart Hogg to shoulder the responsibility of captaining Scotland after admitting the honour was too much for Stuart McInally.The Edinburgh hooker led the team out at the World Cup in Japan after being picked ahead of the former captains Greig Laidlaw and John Barclay but struggled under the weight of the role and was dropped for the final pool match against the hosts as the Scots went on to suffer a humiliating early exit.Townsend admits the extra duties involved in leading the Dark Blues took their toll on McInally. However, the head coach has been encouraged by the enthusiasm the Exeter full-back Hogg has shown since first being offered the top job.With Barclay and Laidlaw now retired from international action, the 71-cap full-back with two British and Irish Lions tours under his belt is the most experienced member of the 38-man squad Townsend has named for this year’s Six Nations, which Scotland start in Ireland on 1 February.Townsend said: “Stuart was obviously a very strong candidate given his experience, his leadership ability and his desire to do the role, which was a big positive because it can be challenging.“He’s a mature player in terms of what he contributes. He’s very consistent and really passionate about Scotland, about playing for the jersey and helping the team win.”Townsend has included 12 players who missed the cut for Japan in his Six Nations selection – including the uncapped Alex Craig, Tom Gordon, Nick Haining, Luke Crosbie, Kyle Steyn and Ratu Tagive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74fb14740a3b683027994a7c1fb59e76ba0c6462/85_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b32b00320aca9e22f2fe6681449ffcbb","title":"aaron hernandez netflix documentary","story":"In a Netflix docuseries, the shocking true story of a much-loved athlete convicted of first-degree murder is placed under the microscopeEven by the standards of America’s obsession with stories of spectacular falls from grace, the trajectory of Aaron Hernandez, a star New England Patriots football player turned convicted murderer, was particularly steep and unusually compelling – a senseless, horrific collapse unfolding in real time.Three years before “fake news” became an ominous catch-all, Hernandez’s summer 2013 arrest for the murder of Odin Lloyd at his mansion in North Attleborough, Massachusetts – a news frenzy scene replayed in the first minutes of Netflix’s new series Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez – seemed to be just that: unreal. The facts of the case – a brutal execution-style murder of his fiancee’s sister’s boyfriend at a gravel pit down the street from his house – were irreconcilable with the image of an all-American sports figure. Hernandez, then 23, had just signed a $40m contract with one of the most successful sports organizations in the US, lived with his fiancee and baby daughter, and performed seamless feats of athleticism under the national spotlight every Sunday.But investigators soon uncovered a strange, violent shadow to the amiable football star: evidence he was responsible for an unsolved 2012 drive-by shooting in downtown Boston of two men, Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu and Safiro Teixeira Furtado, who allegedly spilled a drink on Hernandez at a club by accident violent outbursts from his time on the national championship team at the University of Florida, swept under the rug a former friend who testified Hernandez shot him in the face and left him for dead in a parking lot.Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez, now available on Netflix, attempts to sew together his double life into a single, coherent narrative, or at least a more contextualized one. The three-part docuseries offers the most comprehensive visual account yet of the Hernandez story, which has inspired by now a library of content, from day-by-day reports at his two trials (he was acquitted of the drive-by in 2017 with the help of the celebrity attorney Jose Baez), to the Boston Globe’s critically acclaimed podcast Gladiator, which, like the series, examines Hernandez’s larger environment and personal history – his sexuality, abusive upbringing, massive celebrity and postmortem diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease associated with repeated head injuries. (Hernandez killed himself in prison in April 2017.)Director Geno McDermott began working on what at the time was a documentary feature on Hernandez in January 2017, before the start of his second trial. His partners on the project, journalists Kevin Armstrong and Dan Wetzel, both executive producers, had been developing a book on Hernandez since his first trial in 2015 Armstrong had been covering Hernandez since his high school days in Bristol, Connecticut. Their initial film, My Perfect World: The Aaron Hernandez Story, premiered at Doc NYC in 2018. But as fascination with the Hernandez case continued and more information emerged – specifically, confirmation of Hernandez’s closeted sexuality (he publicly dated women and privately, according to several participants in the series, had sex with men) and of CTE – McDermott and his team realized the story demanded a longer series. “I always expected this to end,” he said of the Hernandez saga. “And it just never ends. There’s constantly new developments, new books coming out, new people talking.”Killer Inside attempts, over the course of three hour-long episodes, to untangle the many supercharged cultural threads undergirding Hernandez’s life, among them: the death of his domineering and allegedly abusive father when he was 16, the pressure to conform to a hypermasculine sports ideal, the double life of closeted sexuality, the allure of guns as an assertion of masculinity, the unwavering fanaticism of college football, the impunity permitted by fame, the prioritization of winning football games over literally anything else. Perhaps, it hopes, there’s clear “why” at the center of all this.It’s a futile project, as the production team acknowledges both in and outside the series Hernandez is no longer around to offer insight. His closest confidante, cousin Tanya Singleton, died of breast cancer in 2015. The production team reached out to “hundreds” of people who could speak to Hernandez’s life, according to McDermott, but his mother (with whom Hernandez was mostly estranged), brother and fiancee all declined to participate in the series.Instead, the series relies on testimony from “a tapestry of perspectives … from every walk of life in which Aaron was involved”, said McDermott, including: Dennis SanSoucie, Hernandez’s high school quarterback and secret lover for much of his adolescence, and his father, who was unaware of his son’s relationship with the star tight end until after Hernandez’s death former Patriots offensive tackle Ryan O’Callaghan, who speaks to the pressure to stay silent as a gay man in football Wetzel, Armstrong and other journalists covering the case and friends of Lloyd, who provide a much-needed portrait of the lives Hernandez ended and the loved ones they left behind.In lieu of Hernandez’s own explanation, the series also works in long excerpts of his phone calls from prison to his mother, old teammates, Singleton, his fiancee and others. The audio clips, culled from hundreds of calls the production team obtained through Foia (Freedom of Information Act) requests, “give everyone a look at who Aaron was”, said McDermott. Hernandez is at turns despairing and jovial, weirdly at ease in his jail life, seemingly unconcerned with his crimes.Wetzel doesn’t have a single answer as to what went horribly wrong with Hernandez. “I think it was a perfect cocktail of problems,” he said. “And there were many, many times when this could have gotten a walk back or he could’ve gotten off the rails. He just never had the help or just made terrible decisions.”Over six-plus years of covering Hernandez, however, “you certainly saw a guy who throughout his life projected outwardly what he thought people wanted to see, whether it’s buying the big house or having a daughter, having a fiancee, the tattoos, whatever it was”, said Wetzel. “It’s almost like he spent his whole life searching for where he belonged and never found it.”McDermott said he hopes people walk away from the series, first and foremost, with a deeper understanding of the context around Hernandez’s descent into violence, as well as perspective to continue conversations about sexuality in sports-dominated settings and the damage of CTE. “We’re presenting what’s there, so it’s not like we’re offering an opinion,” he said, “but we do want people to have conversations about it.”The series is ultimately unsuccessful in explaining what is probably unexplainable: what turned Hernandez from a popular jock into a cold-blooded killer. But the hope, according to McDermott and Wetzel, is to illuminate the forces in Hernandez’s life enough to make the context clearer and, perhaps, instructive for someone else. “You’re never going to know why. The best we could do was put out the facts of the story and the viewer is going to decide what they think is why,” said McDermott. “It’s important to keep these conversations going and for people to know the whole story.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5a41ab2ef89be3184cccb4e014c31f646f98d56/117_0_3972_2384/master/3972.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed88b4f1580518c7ca3881f70f5f165c","title":"richard hammonds big review a huge hooray for the end of the world","story":"In this grotesquely ill-advised series, Clarkson’s sidekick goggles at things that are larger than him, ie everything. First stop: the world’s biggest car factory‘I’m Richard Hammond and I’m on a mission to explore the really big,” says our host at the start of this new series on Discovery. “And yes I know everyone seems big to me.” Hammond is 1.68 metres tall, and has spent most of his career looking up to Jeremy Clarkson (1.96m) and James May (1.82m), which is no way to live.I am not saying that Hammond has a Napoleon complex, still less that this series is a sublimation of his weekly humiliations on Top Gear and The Grand Tour, but it probably wouldn’t have been made were he taller. Indeed, it probably wouldn’t have existed if Clarkson and May had been cut down to his size in a car crusher like an obsolete pair of Morris Marinas, which would have been my preferred solution.In later episodes, Hammond will go up big buildings, pilot big ships and other examples of overcompensations for male inadequacy. But for this first instalment, he visits the world’s largest car factory in Wolfsburg, Germany, to make a puff piece so glowing that Volkswagen’s PRs must have been high-fiving each other when they saw it.For the rest of us, Richard Hammond’s BIG seems grotesquely misplaced. These, after all, are the end times. Clarkson’s Baldrick just doesn’t know it yet. “When you create enough cars each year to create a tailback from New York to Las Vegas,” Hammond says, “they have to be shifted off site as quickly as they are made.”That is why, he explains, each day 10 trainloads carrying 1,800 cars made by 4,000 robots with the assistance of 63,000 humans leave Volkswagen’s 6.5 sq km site. Each vehicle has passed through the world’s biggest paint shop where a crack cadre of robots wearing overalls spraypaints each car. Each one contains 10,000 parts from 600 suppliers as far away as Malaysia and Turkey. Top stats, Hammond. But hold on. What’s that noise coming from Sweden? It’s Greta Thunberg wailing over the madness Hammond celebrates. She collects those salty tears in a bowl and pours them into the Baltic. Why? To hasten the rise of sea levels and thereby the extermination of humanity. Hammond has that effect on people.We do not know whether any of VW’s robots get paid leave, but one has clearly been moonlighting. The script is devoid of human input. “You spend most of your time hanging out with robots?” Hammond asks Stefan Braun, the head of VW’s body shop. “Yes, that’s my life,” says Braun. “So you’re the lord of robots?” pursues Hammond. “Kind of,” says Braun with a fixed grin.Why are robots on the manufacturing frontline? “You get more out of a robot than you get out of humans,” Braun explains. Automation is happening in every sector. Hammond himself was replaced years ago by a robot, a rudimentary model programmed to giggle at white middle-aged male bants. Braun may be a cyborg, too, but a more sophisticated one. If VW is serious about productivity, he really ought to be.At least the robot scriptwriter has a sense of humour. “Next,” says Hammond before an ad break, “I get to work with the biggest tool in the factory.” Oh goody, I thought: Clarkson’s going to make a guest appearance. Fingers crossed the pair would turn Laurel and Hardy as they bungled fitting a rear spoiler to a VW Golf. Disappointingly, Hammond meant a different kind of tool.The Wolfsburg factory is so big it has its own sausage factory producing more sausages than Volkswagen makes cars. But unless robots like currywurst, the writing is on the wall for the head chef, Dietmar. To be fair, Dietmar has been making sausages for VW staff since 1973, so could probably do with a career change.Hammond never clinches the point that what goes on here shows our species is finished. We are not needed to make cars nor to drive them. We are on the hard shoulder of the highway to trans-humanism, sucking on the exhaust pipe of history. Viewed thus, this documentary is not a celebration of mass manufacturing but an update of Invasion of the Bodysnatchers.Did Volkswagen pay for what amounts to a 60-minute advertisement? Probably not, but it really should reward Hammond for helping us forget the VW emissions scandal. Instead of finding out how its R\u0026ampD geniuses cheated pollution tests, he plays the clown in a wind tunnel, standing in a harness as an eight-metre diameter fan blasts 32.11 megawatts of air at 160mph into his undulating face. “I can barely stand! I’m really glad I ate all that sausage earlier a bit of ballast to hold me down!”Top telly. They will be repeating this on Dave until the last viewer is terminated by a robot tasked with turning off the last TV. Just see if they don’t. It can only be a matter of time before BP sponsors an award for Tireless Dedication to Sanitising a Toxic Brand. It will be an outrage if Hammond doesn’t win it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/386da051231ce51b79738368dcc1de7ac08dccd5/0_69_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f376642a9c5fe6247090e8568df2b6e","title":"jeffrey epstein virgin islands trafficking","story":"Lawsuit filed by Virgin Islands attorney general cites new evidence Jeffrey Epstein ‘held captive underage girls’ as recently as 2018Disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein continued to sexually abuse and traffic young women and girls to his private island as recently as 2018, with potentially hundreds of previously unknown victims, a new lawsuit alleges.The lawsuit, filed by the attorney general of the Virgin Islands, cites new evidence that Epstein used a computerized database to track women and girls – some as young as 11 – to Little Saint James island, a private estate Epstein purchased in 2016. According to the lawsuit, one girl attempted an escape by swimming, but was later found and had her passport confiscated.According to Wednesday’s complaint, Epstein and his alleged accomplices “trafficked, raped, sexually assaulted and held captive underage girls and young women” at his Virgin Islands properties.In July last year, Epstein faced federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges for allegedly exploiting dozens of women and girls in New York and Florida between 2002 and 2005. He had previously pleaded guilty in 2008 to a Florida state prostitution charge and completed a 13-month jail sentence.Epstein pleaded not guilty to the fresh charges. He died by suicide in a New York jail cell in August.According to Denise N George, attorney general for the US Virgin Islands, the suit aims to recoup damages from Epstein’s estate, estimated to be worth $577.7m. This suit marks the first against Epstein’s estate by the American territory or any government entity. George enlisted her office’s independent investigators and court documents from other cases to allege that Little Saint James was the epicenter of a decades-long sex trafficking scheme.“Epstein clearly used the Virgin Islands and his residence in the US Virgin Islands at Little Saint James as a way to be able to conceal and to be able to expand his activity here,” George told the New York Times.According to court documents, investigators from the territory’s justice department were barred from entering Little Saint James during a routine visit in July 2018. Epstein, a registered sex offender, claimed the island’s dock as his “front door” to block the visit.The island’s government aims to seize Little Saint James and its sister island, Great Saint James, also owned by Epstein. They also aim to shut down the dozens of shell companies Epstein created in the territory that, prosecutors say, masked his elaborate sex-trafficking scheme. George told the New York Times that the damages could be distributed to his victims.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8512ed0f3944405348f7291cd31f2806aaf8bff/438_552_4210_2525/master/4210.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6eab55bfe2e0adb9295d956666359e48","title":"exclusive 2000 syrian troops deployed to libya to support regime","story":"Anti-Turkish sentiment could grow after Ankara agrees to help fight against insurgencyTwo thousand Syrian fighters have travelled from Turkey or will arrive imminently to fight on the battlefields of Libya, Syrian sources in all three countries have said, in an unprecedented development that threatens to further complicate the north African state’s intractable civil war.The deployment came after Turkey agreed last month to come to the aid of the Libyan prime minister, Fayez al-Sarraj, who is backed by the UN, in the face of a months-long campaign by his rival, the warlord Khalifa Haftar.Ankara has supported the Syrian opposition since the early days of the battle against the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, even as the original Free Syrian Army umbrella group grew weak and splintered because of infighting and the growth of Islamist elements within rebel ranks. Turkey now uses some rebel fighters as proxies against Kurdish-led forces despite allegations of human rights abuses from watchdogs.“This is a very different situation to Syria,” said Claudia Gazzini, a senior Libya analyst with the International Crisis Group. “Anti-Turkish sentiment is already strong because of Ankara’s intervention and could grow as a result of this, playing in Haftar’s favour.”An initial deployment of 300 men from the second ision of the Syrian National Army (SNA), an umbrella of Syrian rebel groups funded by Turkey, left Syria through the Hawar Kilis military border crossing on 24 December, followed by 350 more on 29 December.They were then flown to Tripoli, the Libyan capital, where they have been posted to frontline positions in the east of the city.Another 1,350 men crossed into Turkey on 5 January. Some have since been deployed to Libya with others still undergoing training at camps in southern Turkey. More men from the Islamist Sham Legion are also considering travelling to Libya.The figures are significantly higher than most previous estimates.Once source said the Syrian men are expected to coalesce into a ision named after Libyan resistance leader Omar al-Mukhtar, who was executed by Italy in 1931 and became popular in Syria during the 2011 Arab spring.The fighters have signed six-month contracts directly with the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), rather than with the Turkish military, SNA sources said, for $2,000 (£1,500) a month – a vast sum compared with the 450-550 Turkish lira (£52-£72) a month they earn in Syria. All have been promised Turkish nationality, a carrot Ankara has used to cajole fighters in brigades on its payroll for several years.Turkey is also paying medical bills for injured soldiers and is responsible for repatriating the dead to Syria. At least four Syrians have died in Libya already, the  can confirm, although their units said they died while stationed on front lines against Kurdish-led forces in north-east Syria.Last month phone footage of men with Syrian accents claiming to be in Tripoli surfaced on social media, in which one man said: “The Free Syrian Army is in Libya to defend Islam.”“We liberated this entire military camp from Haftar’s forces,” said another, before turning to a colleague to ask: “What is his name? Haftar? Hantar?”The footage was questioned by many who wondered how and why Syrian men – nominally still fighting in the nine-year-old war against Assad – had ended up so far from home.Both Ankara and Tripoli have repeatedly denied the presence of Syrian fighters in Libya, as has the SNA.  understands that Syrian fighters in the country have since been banned from posting any evidence of their whereabouts to social media.Turkey itself has so far sent just 35 soldiers to Tripoli in an advisory capacity, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said last week. Unlike last October’s incursion into Kurdish-held parts of Syria, intervention in Libya has little support among the Turkish public.Speaking on Tuesday, however, after Haftar walked away from talks in Moscow without agreeing to a ceasefire, Erdoğan said Turkey would not refrain from “teaching a lesson he deserves” to the Libyan warlord.Haftar is supported by Egypt, France, Jordan, Russia and the United Arab Emirates, while Sarraj is backed by Italy, Qatar and Turkey. Officials from Sarraj’s internationally recognised government have expressed anger that their allies, other than Turkey, have effectively abandoned them since Haftar declared his intention to capture Tripoli last April.The GNA was reportedly initially reluctant to accept Syrian fighters instead of Turkish troops but accepted the idea when Haftar’s forces drew closer to the capital.Last month, the  reported that an influx of 3,000 Sudanese had been sent to Benghazi to fight for Haftar, joining around 600 Russian mercenaries, in another sign the conflict’s parameters are growing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e67fe2dbca577ac398eefb87c4bd083291c2fb71/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=572ee5dc210cf951cac4acf01f6922b4","title":"putin calls for constitution changes that would weaken successor","story":"President accepts PM’s resignation ahead of possible referendum of constitutional changesVladimir Putin has embarked on a sweeping reshuffle of Russia’s leadership, accepting the resignation of Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and proposing constitutional amendments that would enable him to hold onto power even after leaving the presidency in 2024.In a surprise move, Russia’s government said it would resign in full just hours after Putin announced plans for a national referendum that would shift power away from a successor to the presidency.Putin’s shakeup sent shock waves through Russia’s political elites, who were left pondering what his intentions were and speculating about future cabinet appointments.Boris Yeltsin sacks his cabinet and appoints Putin, a political neophyte who headed the main successor to the KGB, as his acting prime minister and heir apparent.Yeltsin stuns Russia and the world by using his traditional new year message to announce his resignation and hand his sweeping powers, including the nuclear suitcase, to Putin.Putin is prevented by the constitution from running for a third term as president.

One of his earliest moves is to appoint Putin as prime minister, leaving little doubt that the two men plan, at the very least, to run Russia in tandem.The president is laying the groundwork as he prepares for a transition in 2024 that analysts say will likely see him abandon the presidency but remain Russia’s dominant politician in a beefed-up role as Russia’s prime minister or in the government’s State Council instead.The 67-year-old has in effect ruled Russia since 2000, making him the longest-serving leader since Stalin, and what he plans to do in 2024 remains the most important political question in the country.In a televised speech before senior officials, Putin suggested amending Russia’s constitution to limit a future president to two terms in office – he has served four – tightening residency requirements for presidential candidates, and letting parliament choose candidates for prime minister and the cabinet, in effect weakening the presidency.Shortly after the speech, Medvedev said that Russia’s government would resign in full, allowing Putin to appoint new ministers. Medvedev, who also announced his intention to step down, was appointed to a new position as the deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, which is headed by Putin. Russian media reported that government ministers were blindsided by the decision to resign.Russia’s tax service chief Mikhail Mishustin has been chosen by Putin as Medvedev’s replacement, the Kremlin said later on Wednesday. The 53-year-old has worked in the government since 1998 and kept a low profile while serving as the head of the Federal Tax Service since 2010.Putin presented his amendments to the constitution as a significant change to Russia’s governing document, and called for the first nationwide referendum since 1993 to confirm them. An elections official said within an hour of Putin’s speech that a referendum could be prepared as soon as the proposals to amend the constitution were formalised.Margarita Simonyan, the head of the RT television station, wrote that “effectively, power in Russia is moving to the legislative branch”. Less credulous observers saw an attempt by Putin to lay the groundwork for a transition of power in 2024, when he should, under the constitution, step down from the presidency after serving two terms back-to-back as Russia’s head of state.Vladimir Putin’s selection for Russia’s next prime minister is a loyal technocrat seen as a capable placeholder while the Russian president plans for his political succession.Mikhail Mishustin, 53, is the head of Russia’s tax service, credited with bringing digital tools to revolutionise the agency and help it crack down on tax evasion.His nomination came on Wednesday as Putin embarked on a sweeping reshuffle of the country’s leadership. Mishustin met Putin in the Kremlin where the Russian president “suggested to him that he take the post of the head of government” which he accepted, the Kremlin said.He will face a vote of approval in the Russian parliament within a week, which is almost certain to pass.Mishustin, a graduate of the Stankin Moscow State Technological University, has headed the tax service since being appointed by Putin in 2010, and also worked for the agency in the 1990s.He has also worked as the president of an investment company and as the head of a laboratory for a Moscow-based computer company.A recent profile of Mishustin in the Financial Times called him the “taxman of the future” and credited him with developing a real-time system “directed more at shopkeepers than oligarchs.”Mishustin is not thought to be among the likely candidates to be Putin’s eventual replacement, who have largely included powerful officials known to be longtime allies of the president, including city heads, members of his presidential administration, and even former bodyguards.“The main result of Putin’s speech: what idiots (andor crooks) are all those who said that Putin would leave in 2024,” wrote Alexei Navalny, a vocal leader of Russia’s opposition.The question of whom Putin will name as his successor has been guessed at widely.Alexey Makarkin of the Center for Political Technologies, a Moscow-based thinktank, said Putin’s constitutional amendments were an attempt to plan for his transition in 2024 and to reduce the focus on whom he would select as a successor by making that role less important.Few expect Putin will want to retire from public life, or that he could do so safely. Instead, he could become prime minister again, as he did in 2008, or follow political models from countries such as Kazakhstan, where the former president Nursultan Nazarbayev stepped down from the presidency last year but remained head of the security council and the ruling party.“It’s still early to say what role Putin will play,” Makarkin continued. One option, he noted, would be remaining the head of the State Council, the body of top officials he addressed on Wednesday. But Putin’s remarks were a “distinct signal” that he would not remain president after his current term ends, Makarkin said. Under term limits, Putin left the presidency for four years in 2008 in a tumultuous period during which Russia fought a war in Georgia, faced growing anti-Kremlin protests, and failed to block a Nato intervention in Libya. By 2012, Putin was back, and his temporary replacement, Dmitry Medvedev, no longer seen as a viable successor in the long term.Russia is scheduled to hold parliamentary elections in 2021, and the proposed amendments would make it doubly important for Putin to hold a loyal majority in the State Duma, perhaps forging a formal relationship with United Russia, the country’s ruling party.Expectations for Wednesday’s speech, which was relayed on a handful of electronic screens around the capital, were high. The speech focused heavily on the themes of poverty and social support, with Putin promising additional support for families with children, in an effort to raise the country’s birth rate and higher pensions.Still, Putin’s plan for constitutional amendments received the most attention. In the speech, he also said future presidential candidates should not hold foreign citizenship or residency permits. Judges and federal agency heads should also not hold foreign citizenship or residency permits, he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b04e03d34222b1aa7af37cf9d5ea81ca73cc5af/0_214_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fba0fc0f7d3315e9d2e2e73ef8af3bea","title":"uks attempt to resettle refugee children from syria to be rejected","story":"Officials say they won’t allow the children to be reunited with family in the UK unless their mother joins themSyrian-Kurdish authorities responsible for Islamic State refugee camps are likely to deny any UK request to repatriate four British children if the condition imposed to allow their return is that their mother cannot return with them.British government sources have said that they were willing to consider allowing Mehak Aslam’s four young daughters to return to the UK to live with Aslam’s parents, as long as she and her husband Shahan Choudhury remain in Syria.The couple left the UK to live under the Isis caliphate in the middle of the decade and had five children, one of whom died. Both have had their British citizenship stripped by the Home Office, which believes they pose a potential security risk.But the Syrian-Kurdish authorities, responsible for the camp where Aslam and her children are, have said many governments have made similar requests – and that they had always been rejected as it would involve separating families.A source close to the Syrian-Kurdish administration said: “Abdulkarim Omar, the co-chairman of the bureau of external affairs for the Kurdish administration of north and east Syria, has always said the administration’s position has always been that we will not allow children to be separated from their parents.”In November, a small number of orphans were repatriated to the UK, a decision justified at the time by foreign secretary, Dominic Raab. “Innocent, orphaned children should never have been subjected to the horrors of war,” he said.That had been deemed to be a one-off, partly because of the differences over family separation – and the Home Office indicated that they did not expect any of the other 60 British children in Syrian refugee camps to be allowed to come to the UK.But Aslam’s parents want their grandchildren to be allowed to return to the UK and have urged their daughter to give them up, although it is not clear that this would satisfy the Syrian Kurds. Speaking to ITV News earlier this week, her father Mohammed Aslam said: “That’s a hard reality but at least they’ll be safe here – at least they’ll be safe and secure.”Aslam was captured early last year, along with her four daughters as Isis made its last stand in the town of Baghuz in eastern Syria. Last June, Choudhury gave an interview in which he said he and his wife left the UK with the intention of helping Muslims in refugee camps who had been fleeing war in Syria.Choudhury said that he was not a fighter for the terror group, which lost the last of its territory in April last year, but said he had worked in public services for Isis, and his that last job was working as a gravedigger. “Somebody has to bury the dead people, who’s going to do that? There were dead bodies everywhere,” he said.The Home Office and the Foreign Office said they did not comment on specific cases. A Foreign Office spokesperson added: “Every request for consular assistance is considered on a case by case basis. Decisions take into account all relevant considerations including nationality, national security and feasibility.”Orlaith Minogue, from Save the Children, said that while she could not comment on the detail of the case, the charity did not support the separation of families.“Wherever possible, we urge that children be repatriated along with their mothers to retain family unity and avoid further distress,” she said, adding that further decisions about what happens next should take place in the UK."},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Can you put the facts about yourself together to see what picture may emerge?College application process can seem intimidating and complex \u0026ndash here\u0026rsquos how to do itA reduction in the artificially inflated range of choices would lead to lower drop-out ratesEmployers will be interested in your range of problem-solving and lateral thinking skillsParents\u0026rsquo perception of the education options for their children are often outdatedAs numbers of students choosing to study abroad increase, we look at the optionsThe costs of college are particularly high for students living in rented or student accommodationPrimary and secondary school may be expensive, but costs climb sharply at third levelWhat do Ireland\u0026rsquos universities offer students by way of sports and health facilities?Download PDFs of our comprehensive list of level 8 and level 67 courses"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"European Commission chief says Ireland\u0026rsquos sovereignty magnified by EU in Brexit debateThe Khan family has been living in direct provision in Cork since leaving Saudi ArabiaJuvenile charged with seven offences including theft and dangerous drivingBritsh government had announced \u0026pound2bn to put Stormont on \u0026lsquosustainable footing\u0026rsquoAdmissions legislation comes into force from September 2021EU funds expected to help retrain workers at power plants like MoneypointUtility vehicle was removing tents pitched along the Grand Canal in DublinCounsel said the club was shocked by its suspensionLeo Varadkar is criticised after calling on FF mayor to make statement on incidentParty says economic growth is strong enough to see extra spending of up to \u0026euro4.4bn a yearPatricia O\u0026rsquoConnor received a minimum of three blows to the head at her Rathfarnham home \u0026ndash court\u0026lsquoNo decision\u0026rsquo made to use Chinese-made facial recognition technology, councillors toldGreen Party says it will take at least a decade to turn Ireland from a laggard into a leader in terms of responding to climate changeKevin Maguire also pleaded guilty to charge of distributing child pornographyEx-speaker of House made comments at event marking end of Young Scientist exhibition"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4141108.1579125400!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tributes paid to kilkenny man who ran new york s oldest irish pub","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe funeral of Matty Maher, the Kilkenny-born proprietor of McSorley’s Old Ale House in New York City, who died on January 11th, aged 80. The funeral was held at the Holy Trinity church in Whitestone, New York. Photograph: Lauren CrothersMcSorley’s Old Ale House, opened by Irish immigrant John McSorley in 1854, is the oldest Irish pub in New York, where sawdust on the floor provides a comforting crunch underfoot and walls are decked with mementos of yesteryear.The chair Abraham Lincoln is alleged to have sat on looks down over the bar, along with dusty fire helmets and the turkey wishbones eaten by men who never returned from war.This week, however, the mood in the popular East Village haunt in Manhattan is sombre, following the passing of its beloved long-time owner, Kilkenny-born Matty Maher, who was buried on Wednesday.His funeral on a bright, crisp morning on Wednesday was attended by hundreds of family and friends. His casket was escorted by two pipers from the New York fire department, and carried under an arch of hurleys.Mr Maher’s daughter, Andrea spoke of a man who loved “laughter, stories and song”.“Nothing ever held him down. He saw good in any situation,” she said.Paying tribute, Fr Tom Brosnan said tombstones usually have a hyphen between the deceased’s dates of birth and death: “Matty’s hyphen should be very long not because of the years he lived, but because of the things he accomplished in those years.”Mr Maher’s move to New York and eventual ownership of the bar was serendipitous, following a chance meeting in 1964 when he was just 25 with its then-owner, Harry Kirwan after Kirwan’s car broke down during a holiday in Ireland.The young Maher came to his aid, and the older publican promised the young Kilkenny man a job should he ever find himself in New York. Mr Kirwan was true to his word.Stepping into those shoes years later, one of Mr Maher’s greatest gifts was in knowing “all the regulars”, who included second World War veterans, but also in remembering people he’d only met once.Recalling his employer, the pub’s longest-serving barman, Jeff Bartholomew, hired by Mr Maher in 1972 when the latter was the manager, said: “He ran the taps. He was the nexus for the whole place.“He was one of those guys you’d really want to be in a foxhole with. He could see what was going on and he knew what was going on,” Mr Bartholomew, said on Tuesday before leaving for his old boss’s wake.‘Traditional Irish publican’Remembering one of Mr Maher’s final visits to the pub, fellow bartender and family relative, Shane Buggy said he had been “a true, traditional Irish publican” right to the end.Encountering a group he had not seen for 15 years, the elderly landlord “walked over to the bar, got a fistful of ale and just dropped it down and said, ‘Welcome back, lads.’ He was always like that. His generosity knew no bounds.”His passing shocked family and friends, said Buggy, remembering his last meeting with him a week ago, where his boss left him parting advice.“Ah you’re doing a great job down there, lads, keep it going,” Mr Maher had said. “Keep those doors open and keep the fire lit and you’ll have a crowd there this afternoon.”In its own message on Facebook, McSorley’s said: “When he started working at the bar, McSorley’s was still a men-only establishment with dozens of flophouses within blocks from 15 East 7th Street. When they had to let women in by court order on August 11th, 1970, the bar’s future was uncertain.“And when Matty purchased the place in 1977, the city was near bankrupt and the neighbourhood’s future uncertain. Landlords were just walking away from their buildings, heroin was rampant, cars had to wait in lines that extended for blocks just to get gas, crime, and grime everywhere.“But Matty left poverty back in Ireland and he was determined to leave it behind for good. He saw an opportunity and believed in the American Dream. And he loved history and all things Irish and knew McSorley’s and the city could survive when so many others told him he was absolutely nuts.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4141021.1579123946!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk funding for north is woefully inadequate finance minister","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe British government is to provide a £2 billion injection of financial support to help the restored Northern Executive and Assembly begin working on a “sustainable footing”, Julian Smith, Northern  Secretary, has announced. Photograph:  Liam McBurneyPA WireA pledge by the British government to provide a £2 billion injection of financial support to help the restored Northern Executive and Assembly begin working has been described as “woefully inadequate” by the Stormont finance minister.The funding announced by the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) involves an extra £1 billion to augment the £1 billion Northern Ireland would receive under the Barnett Formula, the system by which the British treasury allocates money to it, Scotland and Wales.Sinn Féin finance minister Conor Murphy said the funding announced was “woefully inadequate”, and that the proposed package left Northern Ireland’s public services facing “a shortfall of at least £1 billion next year alone”.Northern secretary Julian Smith and British prime minister Boris Johnson, who visited the North on Monday, had come under criticism for failing to be specific about how much the financial support promised in the New Decade, New Approach deal would be.The NIO on Wednesday evening said the British government was providing a “£2 billion injection of financial support” which it said would “end the nurses’ pay dispute, transform public services, turbocharge infrastructure investment and address Northern Ireland’s unique circumstances”.The NIO statement said the “financial package will be accompanied by stringent conditions … to deliver a greater level of accountability for public spending and ensure the new Executive is building sustainable public services”.It said a new “UK Government – Northern Ireland Executive joint board” would be established, convened by Mr Smith, to oversee implementation.Ulster Unionist Party health minister Robin Swann announced on Tuesday that the Executive was to take £30 million from future funding to meet the £109 million required this year to settle the health workers’ industrial dispute.CertaintyMr Smith, however, indicated that the funding would come from London as part of the deal.“This funding provides certainty to the Executive and ensures much-needed reforms across health, education and justice can be delivered,” he added.The NIO said the financial package would allow the Executive to plan new investment over a five-year period.It would involve a “rapid injection of £550 million to put the Executive’s finances on a sustainable footing, including £200 million to resolve the nurses’ pay dispute immediately and deliver pay parity over the next two years”.Around £245 million will be provided to support the transformation of public services, including transformation across health, education and justice.“Funding release will be tied to the delivery of reform,” said the NIO.The British government has also made a commitment to “ringfence £60 million of capital and resource funding” to deliver a Northern Ireland Graduate Entry Medical School in Derry subject to Executive approval, with £45 million provided by the Inclusive Future Fund announced last May.It is to provide £50 million over two years to support the rollout of ultra-low emission public transport.Without providing detail it added that £140 million will be provided to “address Northern Ireland’s unique circumstances”.Mr Murphy said a sum of £1 billion would have come regardless under the Barnett Formula. He said of the remaining £1 billion, £240 million was promised already as part of the confidence and supply agreement between the DUP and last UK Tory minority government.Shortfall“This act of bad faith makes our job much more difficult. As finance minister I cannot and will not accept this and will be taking this up with the British government.”The NIO made clear that if the Executive wanted extra cash it could engage in its own additional revenue creation.“The deal includes strict financial conditions such as the establishment of a new independent Fiscal Council. But it does not include any conditions about the raising of revenue by the Executive – that will be a matter for the Executive to decide on if it wants to release extra funds.”First minister Arlene Foster and deputy first minister Michelle O’Neill had earlier written to Mr Johnson seeking assurances about the funding pledges. Stormont civil servants are preparing detailed costings for pledges the British and Irish governments made in the agreement to restore the Executive and Assembly.The Irish Government as part of the deal also has promised to provide significant funding to assist the new Executive."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4141076.1579123310!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 23 senators to run for d%C3%A1il","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMore than one-third of the Seanad’s 60 Senators, including 11 former TDs, are running for the Dáil in the general election.

He suggested that the Seanad could continue to sit beyond next week if Senators so decided. The Seanad election must take place within 90 days of the Dáil election being called.Among the Fine Gael Senators seeking a seat in the Dáil are former TDs Jerry Buttimer (Cork North-Central) James Reilly (Dublin Fingal) Anthony Lawlor (Kildare North) Kieran O’Donnell (Limerick City) Gabrielle McFadden (Longford-Westmeath) Michelle Mulherin (Mayo) and Frank Feighan (Roscommon-South Leitrim).

He suggested it could be used to fund projects such as the A5 motorway to Derry.Mr Coveney said Mr Varadkar and UK prime minister Boris Johnson had built a good relationship in a short period of time.He said British-Irish relations have been important to the UK and Ireland throughout the tense Brexit process, adding: “Throughout Brexit, even in the darkest days, there has never been a moment in which I was not certain that the peace between the UK and Ireland was as important to the British side.”Ms McEntee said “the next number of months will essentially determine our relationship with the UK, not just for the next few years but potentially the next few decades and beyond”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4139688.1579021516!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fianna f%C3%A1il mep says he cannot vote for brexit deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil MEP Billy Kelleher has sent  a letter to Tánaiste Simon Coveney concerning the rights of IrishEU citizens in Northern Ireland. Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons  The  In a letter to Tánaiste Simon Coveney, the Ireland South MEP says that while he recognised the importance of the agreement passing to avoid a damaging no-deal Brexit, he was “very concerned” that the UK may seek to dilute the rights of IrishEU citizens in Northern Ireland after Brexit.“In all conscience, I cannot vote for an agreement that is so vague and leaves it open for a dilution of citizens’ rights into the future,” said Mr Kelleher in the letter sent last week.“EU citizens in Northern Ireland need clarity and confirmation that their futures are protected and that they cannot be used as future bargaining chips.”The Cork politician asked the Tánaiste to raise the issue at EU Council level with EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.Mr Kelleher told The  that he had also raised his concerns in letters to the British prime minister Boris Johnson and the European Commission.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin was aware of his concerns and the position he had taken on the agreement, he said. He pointed out that the European Parliament had a right to debate the issue as part of the EU’s ratification of the withdrawal agreement.“If you don’t raise these issues in advance, well then there is no point in I saying afterwards that maybe I should have done something differently,” said Mr Kelleher.The European Parliament is due to vote on the agreement on January 29th. This is the last legal hurdle before the agreement comes into effect and the UK departs the EU on January 31st.The MEP said that if his concerns about IrishEU citizens’ rights in Northern Ireland were not addressed in “an impartial, independent manner”, then he would have “grave concerns” about the withdrawal deal “without having any ability to deal with these issues at a later stage”.‘This is their home’In his letter – seen by The  – Mr Kelleher says that “of most concern” to him about the withdrawal agreement are the “hundreds of thousands of EU citizens living in Northern Ireland, the vast majority of whom are Irish citizens.“When Brexit does happen, there will be more EU citizens in Northern Ireland than there are in some member states such as Luxembourg or Malta, ” he said.“These IrishEU citizens have done nothing to deserve this. They have consistently voted remain in the referendum and general elections since 2016.“They were born here and this is their home. They supported the Good Friday Agreement on the assumption of continued EU membership.”Mr Kelleher said EU citizens from the other 26 member states who had made Northern Ireland their home and started families with other IrishEU citizens were “now in complete limbo”.The withdrawal agreement made no explicit reference to IrishEU citizens born and living in Northern Ireland, he wrote, stressing that they were not the same as French or Dutch nationals living in London and “should be treated in a different way”.He told The  that an Irish citizen living in Dublin who is married to a French national may have to apply for “settled status” from the UK if they decided to move to Belfast.“That just diminishes the free movement of people in terms of working North and South and the co-operation built up over the last 21 years since the Good Friday Agreement was passed,” he said.Brexit has renewed general concerns in Northern Ireland about the birthright status of citizens to identify as Irish or British or both under the 1998 Belfast Agreement and in turn their right to EU protections if they consider themselves IrishEU citizens.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Nick Bradshaw  The It will take “at least a decade” to turn Ireland from a laggard to a leader in terms of responding to climate change, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan has said.Deputy leader Catherine Martin TD, recently elected Dublin Fingal TD Joe O’Brien and Senator Pippa Hackett, who is running for the Dáil in Laois-Offaly, joined Mr Ryan as the party launched its general election campaign in Dublin.Mr Ryan said Ireland needs to change “the entire transport system, the entire food system, the entire energy system and the entire waste system for the better” and that this “will take at least a decade”.He said he was “not worried one bit” about recent comments from Minister of State John Paul Phelan, who described some members of the Green Party as “nutters”.Sources said Mr Phelan criticised the Green Party’s record on climate change during its term in office at a recent dinner and also attacked some sections of the party.Ms Martin said the Green Party would be campaigning with “a message of positivity” and “that sort of language that was used by a Government Minister is not the type of language that should be used in any campaign”.“I think that kind of disrespectful campaigning is actually what would turn voters off, and have the opposite effect.”‘Really ambitious’Mr Ryan said all of the political parties need to be asked over the course of the campaign if they are “serious” about implementing green policies.“We heard the Taoiseach last Sunday on radio for an hour and I don’t think the issue of climate change was mentioned once. At some stage in this election the other parties will and should be asked the question, are you really going to go green,” he said.“This election is about the decade ahead, not just the next four or five years. But I think the Irish people are ready to do it, want to do it.”Mr Ryan also said that spending earmarked for large-scale road projects should be erted towards public transport. “Let’s use that in public transport instead, let’s just think big and be really ambitious,” he said.“Are we willing to make changes that are difficult? Because it won’t be easy. Everyone loves the ‘oh we are spending here, we are spending on roads everywhere’. Politically that has always done well in this country. But are we going to be saying it actually requires different prioritisation, and it requires prioritising cycling, walking, and public transport, a radical switch in that direction.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4141149.1579126997!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord leo is all over the gaffe as he launches campaign","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste Simon Coveney,  Paschal Donohoe and Heather Humphreys at the headquarters of Combilift Ireland on Wednesday. Photograph: Paul FaithAFPGetty ImagesAt Fine Gael’s campaign launch in Monaghan, the Taoiseach joined fellow Brexit superstars Simon Coveney and Helen McEntee on the platform and modestly invited the world to luxuriate in the light of their combined presence. With a light garnish of Paschal the Paragon to gild the experience even more, it was quite the show. The event was held in a forklift factory – high-vis heaven for electioneering politicians. Local TD Heather Humphreys was also on hand to show the anxious Taoiseach how to sit into the cab of a Combilift without falling out or, worse still, looking like a culchie. The Presentables are an elite squad of Ministers the boss feels he can take anywhere in the course of the campaign to make Fine Gael look good. They are also unlikely to make a show of him or say the wrong thing – which is more than can be said for the Taoiseach, who made an ill-judged remark to journalists about a serious accident involving a homeless man in Dublin. It came across as political, like he was trying to tie Dublin’s Fianna Fáil lord mayor to the incident. To make matters worse, a photograph of the scene of the incident showed a poster for beleaguered Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy on a nearby lamppost.The comments shifted focus from the message in Monaghan and knocked the carefully upbeat optics out of kilter. This is what happens during campaigns. “We do the best we can to manage the launch, but once it slips into open water anything can happen, no matter how well we prepare,” commented a Fine Gael handler before the gaffe, as he watched a relaxed Taoiseach and his shiny Presentables make their way down for their short press conference. It didn’t take long before his point was proved.Back to Leo’s A-team, although in fact they are really his B-team (much-lauded and well-connected fellow Brexit specialists). They represent the party’s not-so-secret weapon. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe is an honorary member because he ticks all the cuteness boxes, from dimples through to sugar-coated street smarts.Heather, a safe pair of hands, was co-opted for the day. One after the other, they took to the microphone in the very impressive global headquarters of Combilift and enthusiastically extolled each others’ virtues. “Helen, Leo and I have criss-crossed Europe for the last two years,” quivered Coveney. Pause for thoughtBut it is only “half-time” in the Brexit long game. “Half-time” is the sporting metaphor with which Fine Gael is going to beat the electorate senseless over the coming weeks. And Brexit, they insist, is most definitely a game of two halves. So who should Ireland choose to play on? The Taoiseach turned at the lectern and his gaze fell on the great Presentables. “This team,” he said solemnly. He looked along the platform, but he didn’t look back. Remember the slogan? “A future to look forward to, hi”, as the Monaghan version might go. Or #LookForward, as plastered all over the backdrop. Expect ripping yarns of continental derring-do until polling day and, if the launch is anything to go by, shameless EU name-dropping of your Junckers, Barniers, Tusks and Von der Leyens, with whom they are very well got. Meanwhile, Leo reminded everyone he’s getting along very well with the UK prime minister, which is very important in the long run. Helen McEntee got in on the act, mentioning “of course, our very own commissioner, Phil Hogan”. Leo, Simon and Helen “are togged out and ready to go”, gurgled Heather, unlike the other crowd’s “junior B-team”.Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are in a fight to the death, so the Presentables and their leader wasted no chance to take a cut at their main rivals. There was a spirited outbreak of Billy-bashing, with swipes at Fianna Fáil’s “only MEP” and his comments about the EU-UK withdrawal agreement. “Of course, thankfully, Fianna Fáil doesn’t have that much influence in Europe, and as a result the withdrawal agreement will pass through the European Parliament before the end of the month,” dripped Leo, scathingly.Imagine if Micheál Martin, Seán Haughey and Lisa Chambers had been handling the negotiations, he asked. “Would they have done a better job? I don’t think so.” Mission statementHeather Humphreys was surrounded by fancy forklifts and she couldn’t have been happier. In between spouting the obligatory sporting metaphors, she spoke of attending international trade missions with the company. “Of course, one of the highlights was sitting on a Combilift in Park Avenue as the whole town of New York looked on,” she cooed, misty-eyed, as we wrestled with the image of her perched atop a piece of industrial machinery and rolling through the streets of Manhattan. At the first opportunity she climbed into a Combilift cab. “Oh, Heather is a hoor for the hydraulics,” chuckled a local. “She’s the only one who knows how to drive the thing,” said a handler. “How will we get her down from it?” fretted another. No bother. And before long, Leo was climbing up into the cab of “a low material handler that goes in all four directions”, which sounded like a job description for a party press officer.“It’s quite spacious!” he marvelled, hitting the wheel like a five-year-old at the Ploughing with his daddy. Don’t tell Eoghan Murphy, we thought, or he’ll have it let out as a boutique apartment in no time.On so to Virginia in Cavan for the Taoiseach’s first walkabout among the ordinary people. He was there to open the constituency office of candidate TP O’Reilly – “TP for TD”. He made a speech on the steps of the building, promising the town a new bypass, something Fianna Fáil wouldn’t do. He is trying hard to improve his canvassing technique, and has definitely improved. But he will never be a natural flesh presser. He is trying very hard though. He even ate half a rich tea biscuit when a plate of them was offered. There was a scrum inside the office, which had big scented candles burning for the occasion. The crowd was very male and not exactly in the first flush of youth (apart from a large contingent of excited schoolkids). Pay outFine Gael is trying hard to win a second seat in the constituency. As the Taoiseach met a group of women who wanted to highlight the pay and conditions of childcare workers, a local party worker pleaded with the candidate to “push in there! Push in there! Get in there onto his shoulder!”In the local pharmacy, the Taoiseach met the owner, Brian O’Donoghue, but then asked: “Can I meet the staff?” Perhaps it was noticed that he didn’t talk to any workers at Combilift during his tour – unlike his predecessors who would have been shaking the arms off them.Loyola Arnold in T Arnold and Sons hardware and shooting supplies was amused by all the activity. Normally the area only gets media attention when ATMs are robbed, she remarked with a smile. Over in Brady’s drapers, Leo ran in to say hello to the lady behind the counter. What did she think of the visit? “I couldn’t care less.”Then it was into Micheál McEneaney’s butchers. He didn’t stay long. “Craft butcher!” boomed TP O’Reilly, as Leo looked a bit lost among the trays of red meat. There was an awkward silence as he looked at the sirloin steaks and gigot chops. “Oh, chicken goujons,” muttered the Taoiseach at the freezer cabinet as he left. “He’ll not be doing me much good, not eating the meat,” shrugged Micheál.Finally, the Taoiseach bade Cavan farewell at the steps of the constituency office. He waved and went to his car. It was a bit quiet. Suddenly, TP’s handler took command. “Big clap there lads. Big clap!” Day one done. One fiasco down. And despite all that effort, nobody wanted to talk to him about Brexit.

Photograph:  Robyn BeckAFP via Getty ImagesSo thrilling is America’s Democratic presidential primary, so rich in drama, that the man who led by 10 points a year ago is winning by just the eight now. If Joe Biden does not slow this rate of decline, he stands to forfeit pole position as early as 2024.How to explain the impertinent survival of the former vice-president? The media has made clear its preference for a fresher candidate. Even loyalists wonder about his robustness at 77. He is said to have “electability” – but then a man who was said to lack it now roams the White House, and he must have got in there somehow.Whatever the source of Biden’s resilience – in national if not state polls – allies of the US should hope it lasts. Of all the Democrats, he is the surest and perhaps the only way back to the world they once knew.Because Donald Trump, a Republican, has so scuppered the international order, it does not follow that any Democratic president would restore normality. Some of the party’s hopefuls would just bring a different kind of abnormality.While no pacifist, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders would be more reluctant to use military force than any president since 1945. And to no universal cheer abroad. Robert Kagan’s old line about peace-loving Europeans and martial Americans always simplified a more ambiguous reality. It was the first who pressed the second into Kosovo in the 1990s and into Libya in the last decade.Just this week, Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, urged Trump against a partial withdrawal of US forces from Africa. Under Sanders, these schisms would be far more regular, and far less liable to end in American climbdown. In his own way, he would be as large a shock to the international system as Trump has been.Inward-lookingAs for his rival senator, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the dread for US allies would not be a philosophically war-averse America so much as a distracted, inward-looking one. The corollary of her fluency on domestic social reform is a certain terseness about the outside world. A year into her candidacy, we do not know if she thinks it is US business to stymie the rise of China, a question with as many implications for allies caught in the tussle as for either superpower. The worry is that there is more of indifference than indecision about her vagueness.These are not just the foibles of two candidates. These are expressions of a deeper change on the American left. What began as dismay at the “forever wars” has widened into doubts about, say, the wisdom of spending half of the discretionary federal budget on defence while citizens fall through the sieve of a welfare state. “Nation-building at home”, Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama once called it, but he was always more internationalist than that. To revisit his speech in the bellwether district of Berlin Central in 2008, he was messianically so, even as a mere candidate. The post-Obama left seems to mean its domestic focus this time.And with cause. No one who has walked through Skid Row of late could dismiss the moral case for a turn inward, at least for a while. Were I American, I would vote for it. Foreign allies have their interests, though, and they are so plainly served by an outward-looking, burden-bearing US. How telling that even Macron, a sort of European nationalist, who wants a strategically “autonomous” EU, views American tentativeness with so little relish.Woven into NatoPerhaps US allies could have a reprise of the pre-Trump world under Pete Buttigieg. So very little can be said with confidence, though, about a 37-year-old mayor from Indiana’s fourth-largest city. Neither he, nor many active politicians anywhere, are as woven into Nato, the trade consensus and the rest of the institutional tapestry of the postwar order as Biden. The wrong kind of experience, Sanders and Warren say, citing his vote for the Iraq war. But an 18-year-old mistake should trouble other countries less than the parochial left. The most “European” candidates – the most social democratic – are the least helpful to European interests.European or otherwise, America’s foreign friends will not decide the outcome of the Iowa caucuses next month. They will not brave high-school gymnasiums in winter and traipse into corners marked Biden, Sanders, Warren or Buttigieg, according to preference. If they were let in on this pageant, though, with its equal measures of drama and bathos, their favoured candidate should be obvious by now.Biden is just a portal into the past, say his radical challengers. For US allies, that is the point. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/12/31/TELEMMGLPICT000220110844_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqcM9aBJczjGu2JtrWg8AaNebpMG9uWgcnc3MvHmUFhjA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"20 years putin russias leader could hold power","story":"Russian president Vladimir Putin should - in theory - retire in 2024This was first published in December 2019 and is republished in light of the Russian government resigning.The constitution of the Russian Federation is clear: no president may remain in office for more than two consecutive terms. So come 2024 Vladimir Putin should - in theory - retire. But few believe that the man who has ruled Russia for 20 years will find it easy to let go of the reins of power, even if he wants to. There are three basic scenarios that are chewed over in the salons, bars, and think tanks of Moscow. Which one could be in favour in the black box that is the Kremlin is anyone’s guess - but that’s half the fun of Kremlinology.  The first is known in as “Castling”, and it has the benefit of precedent. In 2008, when Mr Putin was coming to the end of his (first) second term, the world watched with bated breath to see whether he would gracefully retire or give into the despotic temptation to re-write the constitution to his own benefit. Instead, he confounded everybody by stepping down in favour of Dmitry Medvedev, a loyal place-man who promptly appointed Mr Putin as prime minister - thus respecting the constitution while remaining very much in control of Russia. And sure enough, when Mr Medvedev’s first term ended in 2012, he declined to run for a second term and instead endorsed Mr Putin as his successor - who promptly returned to the Kremlin. 20 years of Putin: Inside the brutal Chechen war that dealt a death blow to Russian democracy20 years of Putin: How Russia\u0027s younger generation have lost the capacity to imagine another futureThe first Castling was a bit of constitutional chicanery that took almost everyone by surprise and was therefore considered deviously brilliant. But will he risk stepping away from the Kremlin again? Last time nearly ended in disaster, with Mr Medvedev reportedly gathering supporters to make his own grab for a second term, and massive protests on the streets of Moscow when the public realised they had been fooled. Vladimir Putin watches the men\u0026#39s 4x10 K cross-country relay with Dmitry Medvedev at the 2014 Winter Olympics in 2014That’s why some think that this time, the Kremlin will take the second option and simply re-write the constitution. Approval shouldn’t be a problem: the Kremlin could easily muster the two thirds of the lower house, three quarters of the upper house, and approval of two thirds of Russia’s 83 federal regions needed to pass such amendments.And the idea has already been gently introduced to public discourse over the past year. In summer, Vychaslav Volodin, the speaker of the State Duma, Russia’s lower house, suggested a tweak that would allow parliament more say in choosing ministers.  Dmitry Peskov, Mr Putin’s spokesman, said it was a matter for discussion. The vague nature of debate at the moment leaves the door open to changes that could allow Mr Putin to remain as president, or shift more powers to the prime minister in the event of another “castling.”Then again, if the current president of the Russian Federation can stay more than two terms, maybe what you need isn’t a new constitution, but a new country. This brings us to scenario number three - easily the most dramatic, and for that reason the most beloved of op-ed writers, think-tankers, and, well, anyone who loves a good rumour really.Back in 1996, Russia and neighbouring Belarus signed a “union state” agreement that theoretically commits both to an ever-closer and more perfect union. At the moment it mostly amounts to free movement on the Russia-Belarus border and right of abode for one another’s citizens. But over the past year there have been calls from Moscow to get the process of integration on the move again. That, say some, means the Kremlin wants to force a merger, uniting both countries into a new sovereign state would require an entirely new constitution and a new presidency. Naturally, this “new” country would need an experienced leader to midwife its birth and guide its first years or decades on the international stage. Someone with a strong record in running former Soviet states with nine time zones - someone like, er, Vladimir Putin. There are one or two stumbling blocks to this Anschluss, however. Alexander Lukashenko, the dictator of Belarus, is not a fan. Nor, opinion polls suggest, are the Belarusian public. It would also alarm just about all of Russia’s neighbours, with good reason. It would give Russia a second border with Poland and Nato, outflank Ukraine from the north, and scare the bejesus out of other former Soviet republics who already half-suspect Mr Putin harbours ambitions to harness them back into a Soviet Union 2.0. These are not the only options on the table. Perhaps the biggest surprise Mr Putin could pull would be to retire, Diocletian like, to fish and ride horses in some Siberian idyll. But whatever choice Mr Putin makes in the next four years, it will leave Russia and the world fundamentally changed. Meghan\u0026#39s women\u0026#39s shelter visit was organised with one day\u0026#39s notice, says centre manager who described Duchess as \u0026#39lovely\u0026#39Oxford University offers two state school pupils a place for every privately educated student, figures reveal Cannabis at risk of being \u0026#39decriminalised\u0026#39 as police let users off with community resolutionsGrant Shapps tells under-performing rail companies to \u0026#39shape up\u0026#39 or face further actionComment: Boris Johnson\u0026#39s task is to rescue Britain from our absurd technocratic tyrantsBBC will shift its spending to shows that reflect \u0026#39lives and passions of young people\u0026#39Donald Trump is impeached: Latest news from the inquiry, explainedConservative party HQ could move to a new location in the north or the MidlandsBig Ben bonging for Brexit halted, now Nigel Farage banned from launching fireworks on Jan 31Former nurse who rushed to aide of man hit by fallen traffic lights discovered victim was her husbandJeffrey Epstein \u0026#39kept a database of victims and trafficked girls to his Caribbean island as recently as 2018\u0026#39Anorexia sufferer who told doctors \u0026#39I\u0026#39m not scared to die\u0026#39 was allowed to go home despite being at severe risk of death, inquest hears European Commission backs Poland in war of words with Russia over the causes of WWIIAnalysis: Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s reforms bring both clarity and fog to the greatest riddle of Russian politicsIran chess referee says she won\u0026#39t return home after pictures without headscarf go viral in IranComment: Are cracks already beginning to appear in the Sussexes’ North American dream?Baby at centre of \u0026#39tragic\u0026#39 life-support legal battle is \u0026#39dead\u0026#39, court hearsFemale gambling addicts growing faster than men amid rise in online slot machinesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter -

but still intends to cling on  to power.  Why else would he propose weakening the power of the presidency unless he wants to deny his successor the sweeping authority he currently enjoys?But exactly how the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches of government will change, and where Mr Putin himself will end up in that arrangement, remain as clear as mud.  It keeps rival members of the elite unsure of where power will lie when Mr Putin steps down, and nicely preoccupied with outmaneuvering and second guessing one another rather than cosying up to a clear successor.Twenty years of PutinThat is great for an authoritarian leader like Mr Putin trying to maximise his control of the country in the last years of his presidency, but less useful for those preoccupied with longer term plans - like taking out a mortgage or planning Russia\u0027s economic policy.  Speculation will focus on two of Mr Putin\u0027s suggestions: formalising the role of the State Council, currently a board of ministers and regional governors with no clearly defined mandate, and moving Dmitry Medvedev, the now former prime minister, to deputise for him at the national security council.That, says Nikolai Petrov, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, suggests Mr Putin intends to maintain control of Russia\u0027s powerful security services even if he leaves the Kremlin and balance the power of both the presidency and parliament. As for the question of the actual succession, it is as murky as ever.One possibility is that Mr Putin may be trying to carve out an unelected role as a kind of supreme leader above or to the side of the presidency, comparable with the role of Ayatollah Khamenei in Iran or Xi Jinping in China.Some had thought Mr Putin would trial potential future presidents in the role of Prime Minister.In the last two years of his presidency Boris Yeltsin got through no fewer than four prime ministers before he settled on Mr Putin in what became known as “operation successor.”But Mikhail Mishustin, the former tax service chief Mr Putin has nominated as acting prime minister, is an until now obscure civil servant.   Back in 1999, so was Mr Putin, so Mr Mishustin should not be ruled out.  Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev But bookies\u0027 favourites Sergei Sobyanin, the competent but not especially charismatic Mayor of Moscow, and Sergei Shoigu, the popular defence minister who has overseen successful wars in Ukraine and Syria, remain very much in the running for the Kremlin.Even Alexei Kudrin, a former finance minister who has been considered a prime minister in waiting ever since he quit the cabinet after a public row with then-president Mr Medvedev in 2011, might yet make a come back.  “This is an exercise in keeping options open,” said Dr Sam Greene, the head of the Russia Institute at King’s College London. “It doesn\u0027t matter who is president because maybe the presidency won\u0027t matter.Meghan\u0026#39s women\u0026#39s shelter visit was organised with

university offers two state school pupils place every","story":"University of OxfordOxford University now offers two state school pupils a place for every privately educated student, the latest admission figures show. This year, 69 per cent of offers went to state school pupils while just 31 per cent went to their privately educated peers.This is the highest proportion of state school offers in the university\u0027s 900 year history, and the first time it has been more than double that of private schools. Cambridge is due to publish its latest admission figures later this month, but last year 68 per cent of its undergraduate intake was from state schools. The country\u0027s top universities have been under immense pressure to admit more students from deprived backgrounds. The higher education watchdog has previously said that poor pupils with one B and two Cs at A-Level should be considered for places at Oxbridge. The Office for Students claimed so-called contextual offers give bright students from deprived areas a route into university, without risking a fall in academic standards.It suggested England’s higher education sector needed to be “more ambitious” with how it handles applications from  candidates with deprived backgrounds, similar to US and Scottish institutions.Earlier this week, students learned whether or not they had been offered places to study at Oxford. The 10,000 students who had been invited for interview were competing for 3,909 places, meaning the process was more competitive than last year due to higher number of applicants. Dr Samina Khan, Oxford\u0027s director of undergraduate admissions and outreach, said: “We are delighted by this record number of offers to state school students, and to students from under-represented backgrounds. This creates a strong foundation for what we aim to achieve. We know that students from some backgrounds are not as well-represented at Oxford as they should be, and we are determined that this should change.The figures come after a huge push by the university to boost the number of undergraduates it admits from deprived backgrounds. Oxford runs a summer school for students from underrepresented backgrounds, and a number of colleges now fund foundation years to help prospective applicants get up to speed. From 2020, 250 state school students will receive free tuition and accommodation at Oxford as part of its latest multi-million-pound recruitment bid for disadvantaged students.However, 50 students in the new intake - which will include refugees and young  carers - will be eligible to receive offers “made on the basis of lower contextual A-level grades, rather than the university’s standard offers”.But the ersity drive has led to criticism from middle-class Oxford rejects and headteachers that private school students are being “squeezed out”.Dr Anthony Wallersteiner, head of the £36,000-a-year Stowe School in Buckinghamshire, said last year that the number of privately-educated children getting places at Oxbridge had been “driven down” as part of efforts to boost ersity. Clare Wagner, headmistress at West London Free School where over a third of pupils qualify for free school meals, said she was delighted that two of her students were offered places at Oxford this week. The offer is one thing, but it is still difficult for these children to meet their offers, she told The Daily . Colleges need to be more forensic when they have state school children applying, and look at their potential considering their backgrounds. We don\u0027t want to bring standards down - we just need to make sure the system is meritocratic.University of OxfordMeghan\u0026#39s women\u0026#39s shelter visit was organised with one

power base","story":"The entire Russian government abruptly resigned on Wednesday after President Vladimir Putin proposed constitutional changes in the clearest to date indication that he intends to stay in power beyond 2024 in a different role.The resignation of the government of the unpopular Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev shocked observers who were gearing up for a slow public campaign to implement the sweeping amendments that Mr Putin proposed just hours earlier.In a surprise development, Mr Putin said he wanted Mikhail Mishustin, head of the tax service, to be the next prime minister. Mr Mishustin, whose candidacy will be examined by parliament on Thursday, has a relatively low profile and had not been spoken of as a possible candidate.Mr Mishustin, 53, has played ice hockey with Putin and will inevitably be viewed as a possible presidential successor, as will members of the new government, many of whom are expected to be new.A screen shows Mr Putin\u0026#39s address to the Federal Assembly in MoscowMr Putin has been at the helm since 2000,and he is constitutionally barred from seeking re-election in 2024.The Russian leader is widely believed to be planning to hold on to power, and speculation has been rife that he was looking to amend the Russian constitution to stay in another capacity, possibly as a prime minister or as chairman of parliament or of the State Council, an important advisory body.Capping his annual state of the nation address to lawmakers, governors, top officials and judges, Mr Putin on Wednesday voiced proposals to amend the Constitution that would cut the president’s power in favour of parliament.He did not say if that affected his personal plans but insisted that those changes would serve all Russians. Several hours later, Russian state TV televised a meeting of the Russian government, attended by Mr Putin, when Prime Minister Medvedev said that the entire cabinet was stepping down.Twenty years of Putin“The resignation of the government is necessary to let the president of our country to make all the necessary decisions” to see through the proposed amendments, Mr Medvedev, who has served as prime minister for eight years, said.The decision apparently came as a surprise even for some cabinet ministers.Most of them looked sombre if not shocked as they listened to Mr Medvedev’s announcement compared to the light mood that many were in when they talked to reporters after Mr Putin’s address.The respected website The Bell later quoted two unnamed ministers saying that no one in the cabinet knew about the impending resignation.“It’s all very unclear and unexpected,” Moscow-based political analyst Masha Lipman told The .“It’s definitely part of the (succession) plan but we don’t know right now what this plan is.”Russian President Vladimir Putin meets with Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in Moscow on WednesdayTatyana Stanovaya, nonresident scholar at the Moscow Carnegie Centre and head of the R.Politik political analysis firm, wrote on Wednesday that the resignation of the government likely aims for Mr Putin to groom a new successor, whoever that might be: “It looks very much like Putin is preparing to leave the presidency… and is currently trying to create a safety mechanism for his successor in case of conflict.”Mr Medvedev and his government have been tainted by allegations of large-scale corruption, and his unpopularity was reportedly dragging down Mr Putin’s approval ratings.Mr Medvedev has been Mr Putin’s loyal ally since he willingly assumed Russian presidency in 2008 and then put aside his own political ambitions and supported Mr Putin’s decision to run again in 2012.On Wednesday, President Putin offered Mr Medvedev to work as his deputy at Russia’s Security Council, an important advisory body.It was not unclear, however, if Mr Putin had any other senior positions for the outgoing prime minister in mind.Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Putin suggested vesting the State Duma, lower chamber of Russian parliament, with powers to nominate and endorse the country’s prime minister and the cabinet after that.The president, according to Mr Putin, will not be able to veto those nominations.  Succession to Mr Putin has been “a serious problem for the regime that has one uncontested leader who has to step down in 2024 because his term expires, and it’s been obvious for some time now that solving the problem of 2024 would reshuffling the system of power,” according to Ms Lipman, the analyst.Mr Putin announced changes to the constitution in his annual state of the nation address on WednesdayThe announcement of the constitutional amendments came as the clearest indication yet of where Mr Putin sees himself after 2024 but it did not offer clarity about a specific position that he is supposed to take next.“We can say now with more certainly that Putin does intend to step down as president in 2024,” Ms Lipman said, adding that the president chose not to reveal his future role at this point.Alexei Kudrin, Mr Putin’s long-time ally and head of Russia’s Audit Chamber, in comments on Russian state TV said on Wednesday that it was “too early to say” if the president would move to a new senior post after 2024. Mr Putin’s proposals left enough room for speculation which top job he would be aiming for.Along with advocating more powers for the lower chamber of power, he also offered to leave it up to the upper chamber to name top law enforcement officials, and he spoke for elevating the role of the Constitutional Court to review all legislation before it goes to the president for final approval.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the state-owned news agency Tass on Wednesday that the amendments will not be coming up at a referendum but some kind of vote that he would not immediately specify.Meghan\u0026#39s women\u0026#39s shelter visit was organised with one day\u0026#39s notice, says centre manager who described Duchess as \u0026#39lovely\u0026#39Oxford University offers two state school pupils a place for every privately educated student, figures reveal Cannabis at risk of being \u0026#39decriminalised\u0026#39 as police let users off with community resolutionsGrant Shapps tells under-performing rail companies to \u0026#39shape up\u0026#39 or face further actionComment: Boris Johnson\u0026#39s task is to rescue Britain from our absurd technocratic tyrantsBBC will shift its spending to shows that reflect \u0026#39lives and passions of young people\u0026#39Donald Trump is impeached: Latest news from the inquiry, explainedConservative party HQ could move to a new location in the north or the MidlandsBig Ben bonging for Brexit halted, now Nigel Farage banned from launching fireworks on Jan 31Former nurse who rushed to aide of man hit by fallen traffic lights discovered victim was her husbandJeffrey Epstein \u0026#39kept a database of victims and trafficked girls to his Caribbean island as recently as 2018\u0026#39Anorexia sufferer who told doctors \u0026#39I\u0026#39m not scared to die\u0026#39 was allowed to go home despite being at severe risk of death, inquest hears European Commission backs Poland in war of words with Russia over the causes of WWIIAnalysis: Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s reforms bring both clarity and fog to the greatest riddle of Russian politicsIran chess referee says she won\u0026#39t return home after pictures without headscarf go viral in IranComment: Are cracks already beginning to appear in the Sussexes’ North American dream?Baby at centre of \u0026#39tragic\u0026#39 life-support legal battle is \u0026#39dead\u0026#39, court hearsFemale gambling addicts growing faster than men amid rise in online slot machinesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/08/13/istock-1160205101.jpg","title":"food waste 20 pledges sustainable ways to eat","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.‘I am forced to look at the piles of food I’ve wasted, it’s not a pretty picture. How did things get so bad in my kitchen?’ asks food writer Julia Platt LeonardI avoid cleaning my refrigerator like other people put off doing their taxes. I wait until it’s a sea of plastic containers, cling-film-wrapped onion halves, teetering jars – until I can’t find the mayonnaise or remember where the parmesan cheese is. Only then, when I can’t fit another thing inside, do I take it all out.\u0026nbspI throw out the piece of salmon skin I was going to give to the dogs. I toss out something spore-covered (carrots? meatballs?) and another item I think used to be a solid but is now liquid. Judging by the amount of mould, you’d think I was starting up a penicillin laboratory.And each time I chuck out an uneaten leftover or a floppy cucumber I feel ashamed – ashamed at the waste. As a food writer, I know better.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, about one third of the food produced in the world – a whopping 1.3 billion tonnes – is wasted or lost. In richer countries we waste as much food as sub-Saharan Africa produces. I’ve interviewed farmers, written about food policy and yet I’m part of the problem.I see myself standing before a food waste deity (picture Greta Thunberg with a white beard) and am forced to look at the piles of food I’ve wasted. It’s not a pretty picture. How did things get so bad in my kitchen?Why I’ve decided to start cycling to workI went to cooking school and worked in professional kitchens so FIFO – “first-in, first-out” – was my mantra. Food came in and we prepared and served it to ensure that waste was kept to a minimum. We labelled containers and made prep lists so nothing was missed. The walk-in fridge was kept clean, for hygiene reasons of course, but also so we knew what we had and ordered accordingly. My fridge? A disaster zone.I wasn’t raised to waste. My maternal grandparents came from western Kentucky, got married during the depression, and would no sooner have wasted a morsel of food than they would have walked down the street naked. When things were really tight, my grandmother reused coffee grounds and gave cucina povera a decidedly southern twist. My mother was the same, serving a meal one night, leftovers the next, and if necessary ‘must-go’ servings on the third.Food that’s not eaten either goes down the drain, is incinerated or ends up on a landfill where greenhouse gases are generated. That’s waste. But it’s also a waste because land, water, labour and energy were spent to create the food I binned. It’s also food that could have fed other people.My food waste, whether it’s the mystery container wedged in the back of the fridge or the past-sell-by date beans on my cupboard shelves, must stop. That’s why I’ve committed to reducing my food waste in 2020.Why I\u0027m making my home more eco-friendlyThat means getting a handle on what comes in my kitchen and what goes back out. It also means taking a critical look at the food choices I’m making. If I want my kitchen to be more sustainable then it’s time to ask some tough questions. Where do the foods I eat come from? What impact do they make on the earth? Can I justify eating avocados or pouring almond milk on my cereal? And the elephant – scratch that, cow – in the room, can I be an ethical omnivore?I’m going to learn more about food labelling to find out what it tells us, and what it doesn’t. I’ll figure out how to cut down on plastic in my kitchen and waste in my cooking. I’ll embrace my leftovers and think before I buy.I’ll make my kitchen and my cooking more sustainable in 2020, one meal at a time.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The remaining $5 trillion of its funds are passive, meaning it\u0026nbspsimply allocates clients’\u0026nbspmoney\u0026nbspto a basket of stocks and bonds weighted in such a way as to track indexes such as the FTSE 100, for example.Investment giant threatens to pull funds from gunmakersBecause oil and gas companies account for a significant slice of major stock markets, BlackRock will remain heavily invested in them unless it makes further policy changes.Jeanne Martin, campaign manager at ShareAction said: “Larry Fink talks a lot about companies’ purpose, but there are questions left unanswered about what BlackRock’s own purpose is, and how its stewardship delivers the social, environmental, and financial performance that its clients are looking for.“While we welcome its commitment to improve transparency of its stewardship activities, for far too long the asset manager has kept everyone in the dark about the companies it was meeting with, the topics discussed, and most importantly the outcome of those engagements.\u0026nbsp“But we might not like what we see when we open the door on these activities: BlackRock’s current voting disclosures on climate issues give little comfort that it will vote in a manner fitting of the climate crisis.”Ms Martin added: “BlackRock’s coal estment decision is yet another significant blow to the already dying market.”The ShareAction\u0026nbspcharity is calling on the fund manager to go further by using its voting rights to pressure banks to stop financing coal.BlackRock’s announcement comes a day after almost all of Britain’s top universities committed to selling their shares in fossil fuel companies after pressure from eco-conscious students who have occupied buildings and carried out hunger strikes.\u0026nbspCharlie Kronick, climate finance campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said:\u0026nbsp“BlackRock’s announcement this morning is an acknowledgement of the culpability of the financial sector for the climate emergency, their responsibility to fix it, and the impossibility of carrying on business as usual now that the world is awake to the crisis we have created.\u0026nbsp“Barclays Bank and other UK institutions financing fossil fuel expansion need to step up and do the same, and do it quickly, if they want to avoid becoming the target of unprecedented pressure from activists and investors to end their ongoing funding of the climate emergency.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The closely watched London market has, for example, been torpid of late and that hasn’t changed. A 0.5 per cent fall since October was recorded with the annual rise coming in at just 0.2 per cent.\u0026nbspCompare that to the situation in Wales where the market is hotter than a packet of Scotch Bonnet chilli peppers. Annual growth came in at an eye popping 7.8 per cent.\u0026nbspThe general expectation is that prices will continue on an upward trajectory. There is a caveat. This assumes Boris Johnson and his merry men don’t muck things up by bringing in the no deal Brexit by the back door some of the frothing extremists on the benches behind him still crave.\u0026nbspBut that’ll muck up more than just a few house prices.\u0026nbspFor now, it’s good news for those already on the ladder, not so much fun for those trying to work out how to on earth they’re supposed to get on to the first rung. That is if they can’t call upon the Bank of Mum and Dad.\u0026nbspWage rises are, it’s true, running comfortably ahead of consumer prices. But they’ve started to come off, further strengthening the hand of the doves on the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. \u0026nbspIt bears repeating that they spent several years lagging behind prices. There’s a lot of catching up still to be done.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

The remaining $5 trillion of its funds are passive, meaning it\u0026nbspsimply allocates clients’\u0026nbspmoney\u0026nbspto a basket of stocks and bonds weighted in such a way as to track indexes such as the FTSE 100, for example.Investment giant threatens to pull funds from gunmakersBecause oil and gas companies account for a significant slice of major stock markets, BlackRock will remain heavily invested in them unless it makes further policy changes.Jeanne Martin, campaign manager at ShareAction said: “Larry Fink talks a lot about companies’ purpose, but there are questions left unanswered about what BlackRock’s own purpose is, and how its stewardship delivers the social, environmental, and financial performance that its clients are looking for.“While we welcome its commitment to improve transparency of its stewardship activities, for far too long the asset manager has kept everyone in the dark about the companies it was meeting with, the topics discussed, and most importantly the outcome of those engagements.\u0026nbsp“But we might not like what we see when we open the door on these activities: BlackRock’s current voting disclosures on climate issues give little comfort that it will vote in a manner fitting of the climate crisis.”Ms Martin added: “BlackRock’s coal estment decision is yet another significant blow to the already dying market.”The ShareAction\u0026nbspcharity is calling on the fund manager to go further by using its voting rights to pressure banks to stop financing coal.BlackRock’s announcement comes a day after almost all of Britain’s top universities committed to selling their shares in fossil fuel companies after pressure from eco-conscious students who have occupied buildings and carried out hunger strikes.\u0026nbspCharlie Kronick, climate finance campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said:\u0026nbsp“BlackRock’s announcement this morning is an acknowledgement of the culpability of the financial sector for the climate emergency, their responsibility to fix it, and the impossibility of carrying on business as usual now that the world is awake to the crisis we have created.\u0026nbsp“Barclays Bank and other UK institutions financing fossil fuel expansion need to step up and do the same, and do it quickly, if they want to avoid becoming the target of unprecedented pressure from activists and investors to end their ongoing funding of the climate emergency.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Borrowing excluding mortgages was 15 per cent of total income last year, compared to 19 per cent in 2008.But the average hides varying experiences with debt for different income groups over the past 12 years.For instance, comparing the 2006-2008 period to 2016-2019, there was a 13 percentage point rise in the share of lower-income households (defined as the bottom fifth of earners) using a credit card. Among those in the middle there was a 4-point rise\u0026nbspand in the top fifth only a 2-point increase.There was also a 4 percentage point rise in the share of households in the bottom income quintile using overdrafts as compared to a 2 point rise among those in the middle and a 1 point fall among those at the top.\u0026nbspThe rise has coincided with an unprecedented period of stagnant wages, alongside dwindling savings, suggesting that low-income households have topped up their income with expensive debt.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailFewer than half of low-to-middle income families reported having any savings in 2016-17, representing a rise of 15 percentage points since the financial crisis and leaving them exposed to a period of hard times.Kathleen Henehan, policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Access to new credit can be hugely beneficial for low-income families, but with many also reporting that they have no savings to fall back on, these high debt repayment pressures are a sign of stretched living standards.\u0026nbspBritain’s borrowing binge slowing but consumer debt still too high“The risk is that this leaves them far too exposed to future financial shocks, reinforcing the need for policymakers to focus on the living standards of those on low and middle incomes.”While lower-income households have taken out increasing amounts of expensive, unsecured credit, wealthier households have benefited disproportionately from record-low mortgage interest rates.\u0026nbspThose in the top household income quintile are more than three times as likely to access mortgages as those in the bottom fifth.Recent research from the Bank of England concluded that low interest rates were the primary driver\u0026nbspof rising house prices over the past four decades, not shortage of supply, as has been suggested.\u0026nbsp“Nearly all of the rise in average house prices relative to incomes can be seen as a result of a sustained, dramatic, and consistently unexpected, decline in real interest rates,” the researchers wrote.A jump in average house prices of 52 per cent from a low point in 2009 has generated trillions of pounds of property wealth, with older, wealthier households enjoying the lion’s share of gains.Estate agents\u0026nbspSavills\u0026nbspfound that the total value of the UK’s housing stock hit a record £7.4tn last year having jumped £2.7tn in the past decade alone. An “unprecedented” 46 per cent of homeowner wealth is now in the hands of the over 65s, Savills said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Borrowing excluding mortgages was 15 per cent of total income last year, compared to 19 per cent in 2008.But the average hides varying experiences with debt for different income groups over the past 12 years.For instance, comparing the 2006-2008 period to 2016-2019, there was a 13 percentage point rise in the share of lower-income households (defined as the bottom fifth of earners) using a credit card. Among those in the middle there was a 4-point rise\u0026nbspand in the top fifth only a 2-point increase.There was also a 4 percentage point rise in the share of households in the bottom income quintile using overdrafts as compared to a 2 point rise among those in the middle and a 1 point fall among those at the top.\u0026nbspThe rise has coincided with an unprecedented period of stagnant wages, alongside dwindling savings, suggesting that low-income households have topped up their income with expensive debt.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailFewer than half of low-to-middle income families reported having any savings in 2016-17, representing a rise of 15 percentage points since the financial crisis and leaving them exposed to a period of hard times.Kathleen Henehan, policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Access to new credit can be hugely beneficial for low-income families, but with many also reporting that they have no savings to fall back on, these high debt repayment pressures are a sign of stretched living standards.\u0026nbspBritain’s borrowing binge slowing but consumer debt still too high“The risk is that this leaves them far too exposed to future financial shocks, reinforcing the need for policymakers to focus on the living standards of those on low and middle incomes.”While lower-income households have taken out increasing amounts of expensive, unsecured credit, wealthier households have benefited disproportionately from record-low mortgage interest rates.\u0026nbspThose in the top household income quintile are more than three times as likely to access mortgages as those in the bottom fifth.Recent research from the Bank of England concluded that low interest rates were the primary driver\u0026nbspof rising house prices over the past four decades, not shortage of supply, as has been suggested.\u0026nbsp“Nearly all of the rise in average house prices relative to incomes can be seen as a result of a sustained, dramatic, and consistently unexpected, decline in real interest rates,” the researchers wrote.A jump in average house prices of 52 per cent from a low point in 2009 has generated trillions of pounds of property wealth, with older, wealthier households enjoying the lion’s share of gains.Estate agents\u0026nbspSavills\u0026nbspfound that the total value of the UK’s housing stock hit a record £7.4tn last year having jumped £2.7tn in the past decade alone. An “unprecedented” 46 per cent of homeowner wealth is now in the hands of the over 65s, Savills said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It does not provide an app for PCs or Mac, and the web version of the social network is lacking in a wide range of features that are available in the app.But in recent weeks it has been reported that its website will be replaced with a web app on desktop, which will give some of that functionality to users on their computer.It also comes as its parent company Facebook makes a wide variety of changes to how direct messages work across its various apps.

I can remember sitting next to him\u0026nbspon a bed and I touched his arm. He turned to me and he said: “Can’t you see your father is crying.” It was many years later that I realised he was crying because of Biafra. That was 50 years ago today. I didn’t see my father cry again. He was mourning\u0026nbspthe loss of the Biafra\u0026nbspdream.For me and for many of the\u0026nbspdiaspora, Biafra is a presence that haunts us. It is a part of our history that is not spoken about and yet we try to make sense of it by reading, watching plays and attending lectures. All of this in an attempt to understand this dream that was on the cusp of being realised and yet failed so painfully.I was two when the war began and four when it ended. This\u0026nbspwas a civil war in Nigeria fought between the Nigerian government and the eastern region of Nigeria. Predominantly the home of the Igbo people, the eastern region – in response to violence and massacres, as well as political, economic, cultural and religious tensions – declared itself the State of Biafra on 30 May 1967 and seceded from Nigeria.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesNigeria was a creation of the British in 1914. It was established for colonial administrative convenience. It merged three separate cultures into one. To the north were the Fulani and Hausa-speaking people, often nomadic, principally of the Muslim faith. To the west of the River Niger were the Yoruba, largely farmers living under a rigid monarchical system and Christian. To the east were the predominantly Igbo-speaking people, also Christian, but with a strain of Judaism and more republican in their outlook. Nigeria is not (and never has been) a cohesive whole. However,\u0026nbspin 1960, Nigeria was granted independence. Violence and coups ensued.\u0026nbspNigeria’s hate speech and social media bills aren’t what they seemIn response to Biafra’s secession, the Nigerian government, backed by the former colonial master, countered with a brutal war. Millions of Biafrans died, most as a result of the deliberate government policy of starvation. From July 1967 to January 1970,\u0026nbspBiafrans fought to free themselves from Nigerian oppression and from the lingering vestiges of poisonous colonialism. Biafra was starved into submission.\u0026nbspBiafra was, and still is, a powerful vision of freedom and self-determination.I have a deep and abiding rootedness in\u0026nbspBiafra and the UK. My father studied at the LSE in the early 1960s and his first job as an academic was in England. I was born in the UK and brought up in two different cultures. To me, Biafra is a dream and a shadow. It is a dream of my father.\u0026nbspI remember bouncing into the kitchen aged nine or 10 (we were living in Norwich at the time) and informing my mother that I was Biafran because Dad said so, and she told me (quite rightly) that Biafra does not exist. I ignored her. This was 1975, five years after the war had ended but my father still dreamed. He was Biafran and so were we. At least once a week we had to eat fufu, a traditional Biafran meal. As far as my father was concerned,\u0026nbspfufu, like our Biafran identity, was both compulsory and necessary and he made sure that we knew this. My sisters and me would hanker after fish and chips!\u0026nbspMy father died 17\u0026nbspyears ago. We flew his body home to be buried. It went without saying that he needed to be laid to rest in the place that was truly home for him. My father’s tie to the home country was a tie to the dream of Biafra. He never stopped believing in Biafra. It was a passion and a dream that consumed him. His passion for Biafra shaped the way my two sisters and I were brought up. His passion for Biafra lingers in my life and has influenced the way I interact with the world and the way in which I struggle and thirst for justice.But Biafra is also a shadow. Not just for me, but for many people. It is the shadow of our past in Nigeria as a nation, whether we acknowledge it or not. The shadow of Biafra exists in the memories of the war and the many stories that are told about it behind closed doors.\u0026nbspThe shadows and dreams of Biafra\u0026nbspare invisible but still very profound.\u0026nbspHis passion for\u0026nbspBiafra\u0026nbspshaped the way my two sisters and I were brought up. His passion for\u0026nbspBiafra\u0026nbsplingers in my life and has influenced the way in which I thirst for justiceDad brought us up to believe in Biafra. He was always deeply passionate about Biafra and our home town of Mbaise. When I was 12, we moved to Nigeria from the UK. Dad wanted us to attend school in Nigeria. We lived in a small town called Idah on the eastern bank of the River Niger in the middle belt region of Nigeria.\u0026nbspMy father had unwritten rules. We were not allowed to study in the north. We were not allowed to marry anybody from the north and he gave us strict instructions to marry from Mbaise in the southeast of Nigeria. Needless to say, that was the one time I disobeyed him because I eventually married a Yoruban man from\u0026nbspthe west of Nigeria.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe furthest we ever got to the north was a town called Jos and I think we drove through Abuja once. As far as my father was concerned, northern Nigeria was a no-go area. He was living in the shadow of Biafra and when we think about the way so many Biafrans were killed in the north before the war and what is happening today with Boko Haram, I can understand why he felt so strongly about this.\u0026nbspSome years after his death\u0026nbspI remember rebuking a cousin of mine when I heard that she had moved to northern Nigeria. That fear and the shadow were very much alive for me even though I was living in London.\u0026nbspThese shadows\u0026nbspbecame part of our day-to-day lives, affecting our\u0026nbspchoices and decisions. \u0026nbspAs an adult I can see more deeply how the dream of Biafra has shaped who I am. I am a priest, but I am also a community activist. My thirst for justice and the need for a better world was nurtured by my father and his dream of Biafra.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Biafra war – in photos Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Biafran man trains with a dummy rifle during the simulation of a confrontation with the enemy in a field of BiafraBiafran rebel soldiers during an attack to take the city of Ikot Ekpene from the Nigerian troops on 11 August 1968A group of mothers and their babies waiting at the Enugu Civilian HospitalA Nigerian army soldier wounded on his neck is carried by his comrades on the pannier rack of a bicycleRefugees walk on a road as they flee the city of Aba, to go to Umuahia, the new capital of the Republic of BiafraA Biafran mother and her starving baby during the famine resulting from the Biafran War Colonel Odumegwu Emeka Ojukwu, the leader of the breakaway Republic of Biafra, delivers a press conferenceSinger-songwriter John Lennon on the telephone during a press conference held after he returned his MBE to the Queen in protest against the war in Biafra and the British support of the American action in VietnamLieutenant colonel Ogbonnaya Oji during a battle of Nigerian Civil War.A starving Biafran child sits by a pile of yamsEnglish model and actress Jean Shrimpton joins a group of anti-war protestors campaigning to end the killing of civilians in Biafra and the Nigerian Civil War, on the steps of the Shaftesbury Memorial in Piccadilly CircusBiafran injured men lie on a street of Ikoi as the overcrowed hospitals of the town couldn\u0027t take care of all the injured peopleA group of mothers and their babies at the Enugu Civilian HospitalBiafran refugees gather after the storming of the city of NnewiRefugees walk on a road as they flee the city of AbaNigerian leader General Yakubu Gowon (rigjt) welcomes United Nations Secretary General U Thant (left) who flied into Lagos to hold talks over the continuing Biafran refugee crisiA Biafran man trains with a dummy rifle during the simulation of a confrontation with the enemy in a field of BiafraBiafran rebel soldiers during an attack to take the city of Ikot Ekpene from the Nigerian troops on 11 August 1968A group of mothers and their babies waiting at the Enugu Civilian HospitalA Nigerian army soldier wounded on his neck is carried by his comrades on the pannier rack of a bicycleRefugees walk on a road as they flee the city of Aba, to go to Umuahia, the new capital of the Republic of BiafraA Biafran mother and her starving baby during the famine resulting from the Biafran War Colonel Odumegwu Emeka Ojukwu, the leader of the breakaway Republic of Biafra, delivers a press conferenceSinger-songwriter John Lennon on the telephone during a press conference held after he returned his MBE to the Queen in protest against the war in Biafra and the British support of the American action in VietnamLieutenant colonel Ogbonnaya Oji during a battle of Nigerian Civil War.A starving Biafran child sits by a pile of yamsEnglish model and actress Jean Shrimpton joins a group of anti-war protestors campaigning to end the killing of civilians in Biafra and the Nigerian Civil War, on the steps of the Shaftesbury Memorial in Piccadilly CircusBiafran injured men lie on a street of Ikoi as the overcrowed hospitals of the town couldn\u0027t take care of all the injured peopleA group of mothers and their babies at the Enugu Civilian HospitalBiafran refugees gather after the storming of the city of NnewiRefugees walk on a road as they flee the city of AbaNigerian leader General Yakubu Gowon (rigjt) welcomes United Nations Secretary General U Thant (left) who flied into Lagos to hold talks over the continuing Biafran refugee crisiDuring the war, my father was away campaigning and trying to raise money for an organisation called The Friends of Biafra. His dream was so powerful and the needs of Biafra so urgent that he simply had to leave his family at this crucial time and respond. My youngest sister was born then, but Biafra had to come first.His thirst for justice and his activism shaped my own thirst for these things. At eight, I was raising money to buy presents for elderly people in a nearby home. At 10\u0026nbspI was joining sponsored sleep outs for Amnesty International. At 12 I was writing about Steve Biko. The dream of my father continues to shape and influence me in my contemporary social justice activities.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspBiafra\u0026nbspis part of who I am and it is part of my family heritage. I remember the stories about the war where my relatives fled from town to town to avoid the approaching Nigerian soldiers. I remember the stories of what they did to surviveBiafra is part of who I am. It\u0026nbspis part of my family heritage. I remember the stories about the war where my relatives fled from town to town to avoid the approaching Nigerian soldiers. I remember the stories of what they did to survive.\u0026nbspI had a cousin who went by the name of Surpriser.\u0026nbsp His real name was Goddy and he fought in the Biafran army. During the war he hid the family’s valuables and property by digging a deep hole somewhere on family land. After the war he recovered everything and from that time onwards he was known as “Surpriser”.\u0026nbspAs a teenager, I always thought he was rather odd and often under the influence of something but I think the fighting affected him in more ways than we ever fully understood.\u0026nbspI wish he was still alive so that I could speak to him and ask him what happened.\u0026nbspAs an adult as I look back over my life I can see how Biafra has shaped my life in both dreams and shadows. And I know that many of us in the Biafran diaspora have similar stories and experiences.\u0026nbspIt is now 50 years after the end of the war and I think it is right for us to remember, because in doing so we honour our ancestors. We honour those who died during the war often from starvation, and we honour those who fought for Biafra.Internet praises Miss Nigeria’s reaction to losing Miss WorldNineteen pregnant women rescued from ‘baby factories’ in NigeriaMet Police officer on Big Brother in Nigeria ‘without permission’I think that there is still the need for answers and dialogue about the war. I think it is a shame that Nigeria has never seen the need to have such dialogue or some kind of public acknowledgement or remembrance of the war. These dreams and shadows will never disappear. They need to be embraced and they need to be acknowledged because these dreams and shadows abound today.\u0026nbspThe people waving the Biafran flag today in protest are mostly people who were young children during the war and some were not even born at that time. They wave the Biafran flag because the dreams and shadows of Biafra are as strong today as they were when my father had them. These dreams and shadows affect Nigeria today the shadows will never disappear and the dreams will never die. The Nigerian government needs to realise that silence is not an answer to the truth.There is a passage in the Bible where God asks Cain “Where is your brother Abel?” Cain tries to rebuff God, but God says: “Your brother’s blood cries out to me from the ground.”\u0026nbspThe blood that was shed for Biafra is perhaps part of the reason why these dreams and shadows still exist. It is important for us to remember Biafra but it is also important for Nigeria to remember Biafra and for the United Kingdom to remember the part it played in the cruel devastation of the Biafran people.\u0026nbspAs for me and people like me, we will continue to remember, especially through stories and plays, films and drama, dialogue and reflection and through the activism for Biafra that still continues today.\u0026nbspLet us continue to remember. Let us continue to dream.\u0026nbspIgbo Kwenu!\u0026nbspBiafra Kwenu!The Reverend Ijeoma Ajibade is a Church of England priest, ministering at Southwark Cathedral and\u0026nbspSt Philip’s, Earl’s CourtRead about the inhumane tactics of the Biafran\u0026nbspwar, which ended 50 years ago today, hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Its mass would be higher than our own planet, but not as large as the ice giants Uranus and Neptune that inhabit our own solar system.If the possible planet is confirmed, it could show us how lower mass planets are formed around small stars, the scientists write in a new paper published in the journal Science Advances.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Scientists believe that they largely come about in the snowline, where they are at the right distance from their star as to have water turn into solid ice, but the planet would dwell much further away than that zone.Newly discovered planet \u0027likely\u0027 to support life, say scientistsThe other known planet that inhabits the same solar system, which is known as Proxima\u0026nbspb, already thrilled astronomers when it was discovered. It is described as perhaps one of the best places anywhere for humanity to potentially find life, with all the right conditions, and is close enough that it could one day be visited by robots from Earth.Scientists have long wondered whether Proxima Centauri could have another planet orbiting around it.That became even more of a possibility when the\u0026nbspAtacama Large\u0026nbspMillimetersubmillimeter\u0026nbspArray observatory in Chile spotted an unknown source of light spectrum signals coming from the solar system. At the time, scientists wondered whether the mysterious light was coming from another planet, leaking out from a nearby galaxy – or if it might be something else entirely.In the newly published study, scientists analysed further data about the signal. They found that changes in the light indicated that a planet could be there – but that further examination would be needed to confirm it.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

By looking there, they could see where phosphorus-bearing molecules are born, in a vast process that comes alongside the formation of new stars and planetary systems.Those observations allowed scientists to see that the molecules are born as the stars themselves are formed. As gas flows out of the newly formed stars, it opens up gaps between the interstellar clouds – and the molecules are formed on those vast gaps, as the shocks and radiation spill out of the baby star.Astronomers then moved to look at how those molecules could have made their way across the universe, tracking their potential trail as they went. They looked at the comet\u0026nbsp67PChuryumov-Gerasimenko, which was examined by the Rosetta spacecraft, which carried an important sensor known as Rosina.The scientists found that\u0026nbspphosphorus-bearing compounds could get stuck in comets which would then transport them elsewhere in the universe.Phosphorus is essential for life as we know it, said Kathrin Altwegg, the Principal Investigator for Rosina and an author on the new study. As comets most probably delivered large amounts of organic compounds to the Earth, the phosphorus monoxide found in comet 67P may strengthen the link between comets and life on Earth.​Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension.

He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.

Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. He declined to license the music for use in the film – Swift also claimed he would only let her use her music if she agreed to stop talking about him in public.\u0026nbspLast month,\u0026nbspVariety\u0026nbspreported that the music rights had been cleared in a timely manner.\u0026nbspSwift was recently announced as a headliner for the 50th anniversary of Glastonbury Festival.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I never knew that there are ways to make homemade cotton pads in a well-managed way. The training was two days. The first day was mainly theory where we were told about menstrual hygiene management behaviour, measurement for the pad making, preparing paper cutting drafts. The next day was the practical where I made two cotton pads. Besides pad making, the training was useful because I gained knowledge on menstrual hygiene management.

Cotton is good but the only issue is that it can run out and that you can’t afford to buy more.\u0027Last spring, the government announced girls at primary and secondary schools in England and Wales would be provided with free sanitary products from early 2020.The government backtracked and rolled out the scheme to a wider age range — also including those in sixth form colleges — after it came under fierce criticism from campaigners for initially only choosing to distribute period products in secondary schools.Ms George applauded the government scheme but raised concerns schools might not take up the offer of providing sanitary products due to not being aware they are accessible.“I am really, really excited they will be freely available from next week,” she added. “The really important thing is the schools take up the government on it. We are pushing for all schools to get involved. Access to period products should be categorised as a basic necessity in the same way that toilet paper and soap are, and tampons and pads should not be classed as a luxury item.”Sanitary products in the UK are classed as a “luxury, non-essential item” and taxed at 5 per cent — with the average lifetime cost of sanitary products estimated at £4,800.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailFemale staff at shop in Japan asked to wear badges if on their periodMs George said lots of friends and strangers had contacted her to recount their own experiences of period poverty.She added: “Some would say they had got really behind on work and missed huge chunks of the curriculum because of not being able to afford sanitary items. One girl searched in nooks and crannies to find spare change. A lot of the time the girls are too embarrassed, because of stigma and shame, to ask their parents. They do not want to put their parents in the situation of saying: ‘It is food or stuff for your period and we have to prioritise food’.”The campaigner said teachers had told her they had been forced to spend their own money on buying period products for pupils after noticing the same girls were missing school each month.She said she had heard from girls who had resorted to using rags and sleeves of old T-shirts for their periods due to not being able to afford proper menstrual products. Women and girls who are faced with period poverty are at risk of a potentially fatal bacterial infection called toxic shock syndrome, Ms George added.She argued a significant reason why period poverty remains unaddressed is due to the stigma and taboo that surrounds periods.\u0026nbsp“Women stick tampons up their sleeves from a young age,” Ms George added. “It is culturally ingrained for us to stay quiet about them. We have been consciously taught periods are shameful and embarrassing and should be a silent topic. Seeing products in schools will encourage children to immediately start conversations about products and around periods.”The activist\u0026nbspsaid she had encountered backlash from trolls since starting her campaign — explaining men sometimes get angry she is talking about periods publicly and insist period poverty is not a real issue.Woman spends student loan on sanitary products to fight period povertyShe added: “They say ‘periods are disgusting, you are a typical teenager who wants the government to pay for everything’. They sometimes also wrongly make the assumption parents can’t afford products because they are spending money on alcohol and cigarettes.”Ms George said she hoped to launch a Europe-wide campaign to make schools across the continent follow suit and offer free sanitary products.\u0026nbspWomen who have experienced period poverty are more likely to experience anxiety or depression and find it difficult to afford their bills, studies have found.Lucy Cannon, a PE teacher at John Cabot Academy in Bristol, said girls were missing whole days of education until the school started offering free products\u0026nbspin conjunction with a scheme called the Red Box Project.She said: “They weren’t prepared so would leak in a lesson, go home and rarely come back. Or, they were simply too scared to come into school without any products.

And it is currently under review by the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), due to report to Boris Johnson’s government by the end of this month.If lower-paid EU workers miss the deadline to apply for the new status, they may never be allowed to work in the UK again, as they would be treated as new migrants below the salary threshold, said Mr Evans.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Vehicles negotiate the flooded B4069 road at Christian Malford in Wiltshire after the river Avon burst its banksHuge waves hit the sea wall in Porthcawl, Wales, as gales of up to 80mph from Storm Brendan caused disruption around the UKPuppeteers from Vision Mechanic rehearsing with Scotland\u0027s largest puppet, a ten-metre tall sea goddess called Storm, in the grounds of the Museum of Flight, East Lothian.

We have some incredibly skilled workers who are paid a lot less than £30,000 a year.”Speaking on the eve of Thursday’s publication of new Home Office statistics on the processing of applications for settled status, Mr Evans called on businesses to ensure that staff are helped to obtain settled status, which will allow people with more than five years’ residence in the UK to continue to live and work in the country after June 2021.He warned of a “forgotten Brexit” for EU nationals who fail to register for the new status and are forced to leave the country or fall into a precarious life of undocumented work in the black economy.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by email“Businesses have an obligation to support their workforces and reach out through their supply chains to ensure that any EU staff and their dependants are helped through the scheme,” Mr Evans told a seminar in London. “The damage to British industry and the risks of thousands being forced into unemployment, or undocumented work and possibly modern slavery must not become the forgotten Brexit.”And he added: “Brexit must not become this generation’s Windrush. History has shown us that promises made now are not always upheld later and we must act now to ensure EU nationals continue to be protected by their fundamental rights.”The most recent Home Office statistics, released last month, showed nearly 2.6 million EU, EEA and Swiss citizens had applied for settled status by the end of November.More than 2.2 million of the claims have been completed, with 59 per cent receiving settled status and 41 per cent “pre-settled status”, which allows them to remain in the UK until they have totted up a full five years’ residence before applying to switch to full settlement.Despite a success rate of almost 100 per cent for those whose applications have been processed, Mr Evans said many EU nationals were believed to be putting off filling in their forms or to be unaware of what they need to do, with the vast majority thought to be in employment in the UK.“The future salary threshold for EU nationals coming to work in post-Brexit Britain has been well publicised at a possible £30,000,” he said.“For many, their income will fall below this level and understandably, they are worried about completing their applications for fear of being rejected. It is vital we debunk this myth, and employers take action to ensure their workers are guided through the settled status process to secure the status and rights that they are eligible for and to prevent disruption to business operations.”With the future supply of EU workers at risk, the Aire Centre said it was even more vital for\u0026nbspbusinesses to hold on to their current workforce, particularly as iniduals from EU nations are likely to be over-qualified for the roles they have in the UK.According to figures from Oxford University’s Migration Observatory, EU nationals make up 7 per cent of the UK labour market, with the figure rising to 21 per cent among low-skilled jobs in the factory and construction sectors. Retail and manufacturing are also particularly dependent on European staff, with 50 per cent of all EU nationals in the UK working in these industries.Susan Banister of the Slave-Free Alliance warned that many people from mainland Europe are working in conditions of modern slavery in the UK, trying to pay off debts to organised crime groups, and risk missing out on settled status because they are unaware of their rights.“It is in the gangs’ interests to not tell these people about their rights, especially the need to apply for EU settled status,” she told the meeting. “If they lost their legal status this makes them more vulnerable and more reliant on the traffickers. They are truly trapped in modern slavery.”The Migration Observatory’s director Madeleine Sumption, said: “EU workers are employed right across the UK labour market, from science and research positions to low-wage factory jobs.“More than half of highly-educated workers born in new EU member states were in low and medium low-skilled jobs in 2018. This means they are more likely to work in jobs for which they are over-qualified, one of the reasons EU citizens have been so attractive to UK employers. A range of industries have become quite dependent on this workforce. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“The government faces a big challenge getting all EU citizens through the settlement scheme.“Regardless of how easy it is to apply and how well the scheme is communicated, there will inevitably be people who simply don’t realise that they have to do it.“This challenge is compounded by the fact that there are no accurate figures on how many people are eligible to apply: the most commonly used estimate of 3.4 million is almost certainly too low. So it’s possible that hundreds of thousands of EU citizens could fail to apply without this being clear from the data.“One of the big questions for the next couple of years will therefore be whether the deadline is extended or, as some have suggested, removed entirely.”Mr Evans said: “The contribution EU workers make to the UK economy and to business is unquestioned, but many are put off by the red tape and complicated process. Businesses need to take action now, and failing to do this is tantamount to ignoring a ticking time bomb on a boardroom table.”A Downing Street spokesperson said that\u0026nbspMAC had been asked to review the salary threshold for future migrants, adding: “The prime minister has made clear we want to be welcoming to immigrants and want to attract the brightest and best to the UK.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “These comments, made by an organisation we fund to support EU citizens, are quite simply wrong.“The government has made it repeatedly clear that we want EU citizens to stay, and 2.5 million people have been granted status already.“There is plenty of support available, and EU citizens still have well over a year left to make an application.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The survey of 3,835 members between 8 and 13 January, consisted of LabourList readers, which the website said was weighted by Survation to reflect the membership.\u0026nbspBut given those polled\u0026nbspare drawn from LabourList’s database of readers, who identify as members and are likely to be more engaged than the average party member, it may not be representative of the party’s entire membership.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Others can get it manually by going to Windows Update in the computer\u0027s settings.Microsoft typically releases security and other updates once a month and waited until Tuesday to disclose the flaw and the NSA\u0027s involvement. Microsoft and the NSA both declined to say when the agency notified the company.The agency shared the vulnerability with Microsoft quickly and responsibly, Neal Ziring, technical director of the NSA\u0027s cybersecurity directorate, said in a blog post Tuesday.Priscilla Moriuchi, who retired from the NSA in 2017 after running its East Asia and Pacific operations, said this is a good example of the constructive role that the NSA can play in improving global information security. Moriuchi, now an analyst at the U.S. cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, said it\u0027s likely a reflection of changes made in 2017 to how the U.S. determines whether to disclose a major vulnerability or exploit it for intelligence purposes.The revamping of what\u0027s known as the Vulnerability Equities Process put more emphasis on disclosing unpatched vulnerabilities whenever possible to protect core internet systems and the U.S. economy and general public.Those changes happened after a group calling itself Shadow Brokers released a trove of high-level hacking tools stolen from the NSA.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And what a waste of their chance to play a key role in helping our Royal Family prosper after the Queen is gone.And what a waste of Harry and Meghan’s unique chance to be a living, inspirational representation of the multiracial country in which we now live. How quickly the shine has come off the golden couple.Less than two years after that wedding day, Harry and Meghan are scurrying off to an ill-defined “progressive” new le in Canada.Butthey have been unhappy with their royal roles, they have brought it on themselves. This much-loved couple have always been too thin-skinned for their own good.They have always been hysterically touchy when justied criticism came their way, such as when they lectured about climate change while reclining on private jets.The criticism was nothing personal. Hollywood stars get called out for climate hypocrisy. Do Harry and Meghan really imagine we will just tug our forelocks as they fly around the world in private jets while talking like Greta Thunberg in a tiara Harry and Meghan are never satisfied with anything less than unconditional deference. They apparently loathe royal le, yet demand to be treated like royalty.They have demonstrated an epic sense of entitlement, such as asking the taxpayer to pick up the £.million builder’s bill for doing up their home, Frogmore Cottage.Their great self-pitying delusion is that the wicked British media has it in for them. But it is not the media that caused Meghan so much excruciating embarrassment.It is largely her own dysal family and their indiscreetly flapping cakeholes, especially her dear old discarded dad Thomas Markle and her loony half-sister Samantha. Harry and Meghan’s self-pity is astounding.“Never complain, never explain,” has been the motto of the modern Royal Family. It has worked rather well.But place Harry and Meghan in front of a sympathetic camera crew, such as when ITV’s Tom Bradby trailed them on their tour of South Africa, and they can’t stop whining. Even when surrounded by victims of rape and landmines, they managed to feel sorry for themselves.“Not many people askedI’m OK,” Meghan complained in the Third World. There has not been a royal couple with such a staggering lack of self-awareness since Marie Antoinette and King Louis XVI of France. And look what happened to them.Harry and Meghan owe their mega-celebrity totally to their connection with the Royal Family. Their superstardom has nothing to do with Meghan’s acting career. Their lives of unimaginable luxury are funded in large part by the British taxpayer.The average couple spends just under £, on their wedding. Harry and Meghan were said to have blown £MILLION. Yet they do not appear to have a grateful bone between them. They seem incapable of counting their multiple blessings.Even now, after handing in their royal resignation, they give every indication that they want all the privileges of royal le with none of the obligations. They want to have their Eton mess and eat it.Harry and Meghan’s security alone currently costs around £, a year, paid for by the politan Police — which means paid for by the British taxpayer. Get the Mounties to start paying for it.And can we finally nail the great lie that Meghan has been persecuted in the UK because of her mixed race  When she first appeared, Meghan was a hurricane of fresh air. The British looked at her and it was love at first sight.This weary, ided, Brexit-battered nation was delighted to have an injection of Hollywood glamour. And millions of Brits now live in mixed-race families. There was real delight to see the Royal Family catching up with the rest of us.Among those crowds at Windsor on their wedding day I saw families of every race and creed under the sun who were ecstatic to see the Royal Family becoming less white, more inclusive, more representative.Harry and Meghan have drawn criticism because of their total lack of self-awareness. Both of them are independently rich. Harry is worth around £million after inheritances from his mother and the Queen Mum.Prince Charles gives him £million every year. Meghan made around £million from her role in long-runningTV legal drama Suits.Yet this fabulously wealthy couple have been happy to let others — the British taxpayer, Prince Charles, the Queen — pay their way in their gilded world.Six weeks, which is theof time that Harry and Meghan have just spent in Canada, is a very long time to be away from home.Unless, of course, “home” doesn’t feel like home because you feel criticised for everything you do and wear, your family – on both sides – are a nightmare and you are constantly judgedby people who have never met you and never will.I should imagine that in this case, Canada seems like a very good place to call home. So, who can blame Meghan and Harry for deciding to leave the UK behind to get away from it all, and maybe staying away from here in the long-term I have a lot of respect for the couple for ploughing their own furrow and walking their own path.Honestly, I couldn’t be happier for Harry, who has experienced so much sadness, that he has met a woman brave enough to suggest doing things a bit dferently.Although they are currently making bold statements about giving up the taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant, they show no sign of being willing to pay for their own security, or their own flunkies, or offer the taxpayer a rebate on those reported £million nuptials.There has never been even the slightest hint of gratitude. There has never been any indication that they — this rich, pampered couple with a beautul baby boy who will never want for anything — realise how lucky they are.So Harry and Meghan are not the only ones with mixed emotions today. There is real resentment that Harry and Meghan have caused distress to our Queen and it will not be easily forgotten or forgiven.The Queen has a -year-old husband who has recently been in hospital. She has a son mired in a squalid sex scandal. And she is  years old. Who the hell do Harry and Meghan think they are This feels like an abdication with a taxpayer-funded safety net. The couple plan to “step back as senior members of the Royal Family” but show no inclination to give up the privileges and pay days that come with the job.They say they want to “work to become financially independent”. But between them they are currently worth around £million. Why not pay their own way NOW Are they really suggesting that they turn their backs on this nation while asking it to foot their bills  It looks like it. The British taxpayer will continue to stump up for their phenomenal security bills. Harry’s daddy will cough up for much .So you can’t help wondering how intelligent they really are, this TV soap actress and a man who left Eton with two A-levels— a school where my dog could get four A-levels.Do Harry and Meghan really think they have had a raw deal  Are they that stupid  There is no republican movement in this country.The Queen has reigned far too well for far too long —  years on the throne next month — for anti-monarchy sentiment to develop.The Queen has spent her entire le placing public duty above private happiness.She has been the stable, stoic centre of this nation for so long that she has single-handedly made losing our monarchy unthinkable.Yet when a spokesman for anti-monarchy pressure group Republic demanded Harry and Meghan make a clean break, I found myself nodding in agreement with every withering word.“Theyhave said that they will dip in and out of royal duties as it suits them but won’t stop taking money until they find other sources of income,” said Republic’s Graham Smith.“To suggest they’re not already financially independent is incredibly crass and belies a sense of entitlement and lack of self-awareness common among royals.”This republican is right. If Harry and Meghan want a new le hanging out with the Clooneys and striking deals with Apple, they should fund it themselves.As they say in North America, do it on your own dime. Give up the HRH titles. Stop leeching off your royal status.They will be a footnote in the story of our Royal Family, Meghan the Wallis Simpson of the st Century, Harry another Duke of Windsor who believed exile with his American orcee would make him happy.The Royal Family is not all about them.The Queen will be an impossible act to follow. But the photograph of Queen Elizabeth smiling proudly with the next three generations of future kings — Princes Charles, William and George — suggests our Royal Family will last for at least  years after Netflix has cancelled The Crown, evenone day Meghan gets to play herself.The succession is assured. Decent men will wear the crown. And Kate is great. But let history record that no royal couple was ever as adored as Harry and Meghan.It is astonishing — and unbelievably sad, perhaps even tragic — that millions of us will be happy to see the back of them.Astrological patterns repeat in families through generations, just as it is doing with Meghan and Harry.Edward VIII, who wed American orcee Wallis Simpson, put love before duty, and planted a karmic seed that is at the root of what is unfolding now. It can be likened to a virus that has been lurking in the Royal household and is now being re-activated by Harry and Meghan.So what comes next  Uranus, the planet of shock-waves, moves to confront the Sun in Aquarius on January  and forms a clash with the New Moon on the th.There is likely to be a stinging backlash as all the remaining senior family members have their roles shaken up.Meghan will create a power couple that flourishes by spring with a number of initiatives. By December , another baby announcement is likely.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We would have done the same to protect British servicemen and women. In fact, as Britain’s Defence Secretary I did exactly that, with the full support of Prime Minister David Cameron.Let’s not forget that every country has the right to self-defence.Of course, nobody wants this crisis to escalate. Indeed Iran’s retaliation has been noticeably limited so far.But the chorus for “de-escalation” carries risks too. Iran has been attacking Western shipping, including capturing a British tanker. Iran has fired missiles at Saudi oil refineries.Iran continues to wage proxy wars in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. Through its militias, Iran continues to destabilise neighbouring Iraq.At some point, somebody had to draw the line. Qasem Soleimani was no hero or statesman. He directed terrorist attacks across the Middle East.Thousands of Syrians, Iraqis and Yemenis died as a result. Iranian dissidents, too, were brutally suppressed.The roadside bomb-making he sponsored killed many of our brave servicemen in Iraq. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson reminded us, he had the blood of our soldiers on his hands.Has Trump’s strike weakened the case for Western intervention  It is worth remembering our troops and those of the US are in Iraq at Iraq’s invitation.Since , we have helped lead an international coalition of more than  countries to support its fragile democracy and liberate that country from the terrorist death-cult of Daesh Isis.And thanks to precision strikes by the RAF and the training by the British Army of thousands of Iraqi troops, Daesh has lost the pernicious grip it once had.Defeating Daesh isn’t just a matter of helping a friend in need or of standing up for human rights. Mercully, we have stopped Yazidi women from being raped, prisoners being burnt alive, gay people being thrown off buildings and Western hostages sadistically executed.But tackling Daesh terrorism is also vital to protect our own way of le here in Western Europe.Islamist fundamentalism needs to be defeated, whether in Mosul, Raqqa, a Paris suburb or on London Bridge.So yes, let’s continue to work with our allies to persuade Iran’s revolutionaries to take a dferent path.Saudi Arabia, the other Gulf countries and even Russia all have roles to play in getting Iran back to the negotiating table.After the appalling shooting down of the Ukrainian airliner, let’s try to show the Iranian people their government needs to be more truthful and more open, that there is a better future beyond the mullahs and the republican guards.But diplomacy alone will not be enough. We have to protect our national interests too. Trump’s strike is a stark reminder that in the end, we must all stand up when those interests are threatened so directly.First, we must persuade other European navies to work with the US and our own Royal Navy in patrolling and protecting convoys through the Strait of Hormuz.This is a vital choke point for Europe’s trade and energy. The gas and oil we need this winter pass through it.It is ludicrous that some Nato allies won’t work with American ships for fear of upsetting the mullahs in Tehran.This has to be a US-led international operation.Second, we need a better nuclear agreement with Iran. It was right to try to halt their nuclear programme. But the previous deal wasn’t comprehensive — it didn’t even cover missiles — and it completely failed to constrain Iranian misbehaviour in the region. If anything, Iran used the access to new finance that deal released to step up its proxy wars in Yemen and where.A new deal should ensure full oversight of all Iran’s nuclear activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and only allow Iran back into the international markets when its civil nuclear programme is in complete compliance.Third, we have to step up our campaign against terrorism.Outside the EU after Brexit, we will still need to share intelligence and work together with our European partners to identy new attacks. But our closest ally in the battle to protect our values will always be the US. We may not always agree with Trump’s tactics but we shouldn’t ignore that he has finally cut through the illusion — Iran’s current regime is not our friend.Iran will certainly have learned a lesson from President Trump’s decisive action. But I hope we will do so too.Turning a blind eye to those who foster international terrorism is no longer an option for any of us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She askedthey wanted to join her in the “mile-high club”, then attacked cabin crew who refused her more alcohol.Demi Burton tried to headbutt and kick six crew members and passengers who tried to restrain her before she was arrested when the plane landed.In court, the -year-old claimed she had been drinking because she has a fear of flying and said this behaviour is out of character, which may be true.Her defence lawyer Martin Callery said: “She is thoroughly ashamed of herself . . .  and utterly embarrassed at the way she behaved.”But that is certainly not the impression she conveyed outside court, where she gleefully flicked obscene hand gestures at photographers.No doubt she stopped smiling when she heard she had been sentenced to six months in prison. Personally, I’m not sure how effective prison is. But the problem with reckless behaviour is that you have to face the consequences.And I really hope for Demi, this is the moment she gets her le back on track. We all make mistakes. It’s what we do afterwards that defines us.It would be easy to assume that Demi is a hopeless case. But she is young enough to turn her le around, to work hard, do better and see this rock-bottom moment as a catalyst for change.And then something good will come from what is a very low moment in her le. We don’t have to look far for examples of people who have overcome lapses or mistakes before going on to succeed.Take Robert Downey Jr, who went from drug addict to one of Hollywood’s highest-paid actors. Or Elton John and Robbie Williams, both of whom have overcome major drug issues before enjoying renewed stardom, fatherhood and, more importantly, a good le.While it is not the same as a drunken mistake, anyone who has made it in business will have a good few failures under their belt — whether it is a dodgy commercial decision, plain bad luck or a company that has gone bust.It is not what happens to us in le but what we do next that counts. So I am guessing that, from her cell, Demi might be reflecting on what she might do dferently when she gets out. Andshe isn’t, she should be.Because it is the getting back on the horse that counts, evenit means resisting the urge to go back to bed to hide. No one is perfect. No one gets through le without messing up or things going wrong.Before success, you will get temporary defeat or total failure. The key to getting through it is resilience. And one of the best gts you can give a child is to encourage them not to give up.By the way, I speak here from experience. Like any businesswoman, I’ve made some mistakes and had my fair share of knocks.There are some that I have managed to turn to my advantage and others that I have had to chalk up to experience.The key thing is that I have learned from what went wrong, then moved on. That experience has allowed me to create a mini-manesto on how to fail how to respond to setbacks and failure, which I’ll share here now:Give yourself time to recover and reflect. Force yourself to take small steps to get back on the horse. Do not accept failure. See it as a step on the journey towards success.Remember that challenging and dficult moments are what help you grow bigger or better. Without them, you would stay the same.The only people who haven’t experienced setbacks are people who are too scared to try. So “failure” is often a sign of bravery. Hold your head up high at all times.Try your best and be proud to do so, eventhings don’t always work out the way you want them to. Remind yourself: “Where there is a will, there’s a way.” And as they say, the best thing about the future is it comes one day at a time.ANOTHER new year, another month of looking at photos of scantily clad people on beaches in sunnier climes and asking myselfI am the only person who is not on the beach.This is the time of year for massive bikini-body and holiday FOMO.But let us all take heart that it is also, oh joy, the time of year for elasticated waists hidden under chunky knitwear.Personally, I am more than happy to swap the beach for nothing to shave and no stomach to suck in. Bliss.I’M sure parents everywhere were shocked to read the story of the son who bullied his mother and stepfather so viciously he has been jailed for three years for his controlling and coercive behaviour.When Nicholas Hazell, , of County Durham, went back to live with Judith Ridley, , and her reverend husband Stephen, , after losing his job, he made their lives hell.Hazell, above, created a “horrendous atmosphere” at the family home and flew into a petulant ragehe didn’t get his own way, Durham Crown Court heard.Among his worst outbursts were when Hazell threw his mother into a chair and spat at her while holding a screwdriver to his stepfather’s throat. He also told them: “I am a master of bullying.”It sounds horric.I feel so sorry for his mum, who must be devastated that her little boy turned into a cruel bully as an adult.I dont do needles when it comes to my face.  Lasers, facials, peels . . .  sure. But needles are another story entirely.If you are willing to take the chance of injecting poison into your face, at the very least you want a predictable result. And in my experience, you don’t get it.Who wants eyebrows at the top of their head, lips that come into the room before you do, or a forehead that doesn’t move  Not me, that’s for sure. However . . .This week I read that not only is the gorgeous Abbey Clancy having micro-Botox injections, hyaluronic acid fillers and vitamins, she is doing it with TWENTY needles at once.Abbey, , is having something called an aquagold facial, so called because each needle is covered in -carat gold. The marketing blurb claims this treatment will reduce pores, blur out fine lines and leave your skin with a vibrant glow.Some might say this is a slippery slope to the stronger stuff but Abbey looks amazing.  So it has to be worth a try, don’t you think I HAD to laugh at the photos of the BBC newsreader whose dress, which had burst open minutes before going on air, was cobbled together from behind by quick-thinking colleagues.  Liz Beacon’s outfit was patched up with gaffer tape and bulldog clips.I used to believe what I saw on TV. But since filming The Apprentice, I know all too well that all is not necessarily what it seems.Two examples spring to mind. First, the countless times I have been filmed in the boardroom with a smart jacket on top and leggings or even pyjama bottoms and slippers under the boardroom table.Second, and worse, the time I somehow forgot to bring a bra on a day I was wearing a white blouse.Luckily, a kind crew member who is roughly the same size as me lent me hers.  And the show, as it always seems to do, went on.I WAS appalled to read about the private Islamic secondary school that has been “unlawfully segregating” boys and girls for all activities except weekly assemblies, according to a stinging Ofsted report.One of the teachers theretold pupils “university is not for females”, according to the report. Which begs the question of where, then, is the best place for females  The kitchen Inspectors who visited Birmingham’s Redstone Educational Academy in November last year also found male students were given privileges and treated more favourably than their female counterparts when it came to sports, school trips and work experience.That was something disputed by the headteacher.That’s not good enough. There can be no place for a school like this and it should be closed down.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Perhaps this explains why his Wikipedia entry has just been doctored to delete his status as a “millionaire”. Not me, guv, protests Starmer.He is also weirdly reluctant to declare where he stands on the political spectrum. Is he a Corbynite or a Blairite or a bit of both  “I don’t have the names of former leaders tattooed on my head,” snfs the man named at birth after the first leader of the Labour Party.This knight of the realm, who played violin at fee-paying Reigate Grammar School alongside Fatboy Slim, claims a humble background as the son of a toolmaker.“I know what it’s like,” he insists, asraised in a cardboard box.Well, I went to the same school when it was a “bog-standard” state grammar. My father was a journeyman upholsterer. It didn’t give me any special insights.Starmer boasts in his new campaign video about picket-line stints alongside down- trodden Wapping printworkers — against my boss, Rupert Murdoch, a hate figure on the Left.This chameleon politician was dubbed a “Sir” on the recommendation of Gordon Brown, a title he discourteously declines to use because it invites contempt among those with a vote.His citation was for “services to law and criminal justice”, after a five-year term as DPP.At about the same time he was parachuted into Parliament as MP for rock-solid Labour Holborn and St Pancras, in London.It is here that self-respecting Labour voters should pause and reflect.Many believe these political plums were reward for the longest, costliest and perhaps most spiteful criminal persecution in history — ordered by Sir Keir Starmer.His new leadership video slyly refers to this time, apparently to boost his scourge-of-capitalism image among the “comrades” — even though politics should play no part in a DPP’s decision-making. In a travesty of justice, he rammed two dozen innocent journalists through Old Bailey trials on trumped-up conspiracy charges — a medieval catch-all which even the Crown Prosecution Service admitted was “an extremely dficult and rarely visited area of the law”.The prosecuting counsel was given a flea in his ear for “chopping and changing”, the charges against the journalists.The trials ended with acquittals all round, an admission that “no crime may have been committed” and this rebuke from the Lord Chief Justice:“What concerns me is the freedom of the Press and the desire of officials to contain information.“We must ensure the Press is protected — we can’t use criminal sanctions to undermine their position.”The defendants were all journalists on The Sun or the News of the World — then seen by the Left as fair game.The trials followed The Sun’s decision to switch its support from Gordon Brown’s floundering regime to David Cameron’s Tories.Some believe the two were linked — but surely that’s just a conspiracy theory.What is absolutely clear to those who care about the issue is Starmer’s readiness to use his power to curb Press freedom.As citizens of totalitarian regimes rapidly learn to their cost, without a free Press there is no such thing as free speech.IT’S win-win for the Sussexes and losses all round for the House of Windsor.Meghan’s first kiss-and-tell will be a bestseller, with all the gossip on Randy Andy and those secret royal scandals.Harry’s right-on charities will be milked for millions.Once our revered Queen has departed, the monarchy will dwindle to a sideshow on the US celebrity circuit.Charles is too old to compete and William is too dull, despite Kate’s best efforts.Hero Harry will emerge as victor in this grotesque civil war.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are rich beyond the wildest dreams of almost everyone in the UK.They are more than capable of paying for a few bodyguards.

Now they’ve got to lie in it.A CIVILISED nation treats its veterans with respect.Which is why we were delighted when Boris Johnson won the election on a manesto promising to end witch hunt prosecutions against ageing former soldiers who served in Northern Ireland.But to get Stormont up and running, the Prime Minister has brokered a deal with Sinn Fein which risks opening up new probes into thousands of Troubles veterans. This would be morally indefensible and politically mad.Yes, a working government in Northern Ireland would be a good thing. But the safety and wellbeing of our elderly veterans is too big a price tag.And given Boris won the election by being a proud patriot, it makes political sense for him to stand by the armed forces through thick and thin.If the PM is to hold the hard-earned trust of new Conservative voters, he must never give way to those who would put our old soldiers in the dock.IT would be fair to assume that anyone injecting plastic into someone’s face should have some qualications to do so.But a strange loophole in the law means that though Botox is classied as a medicine in Britain, dermal fillers aren’t covered by any regulation.A staggering  per cent of facial fillers are performed by people with no medical training, often in unsanitary conditions — with devastating results.Which is why The Sun’s Fabulous brand is launching the Had Our Fill campaign, urging for a crackdown on unregulated cosmetic fillers, and raising awareness to help women make safer, more informed choices.We’ve had our fill of dodgy fillers.

Why let reality spoil the narrative These claims made about the “racist” treatment of Meghan at the hands of the British Press are incredibly thin.The same non-examples are recycled over and over again. You have probably seen them quoteda thousand times.There is that Mail Online piece from , when Harry and Meghan were first dating, that said she was “ straight outta Compton”.At the time, Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland lived in nearby Crenshaw, LA.Hirsch says this was an attempt to link Meghan with “racialised forms of crime”, meaning gangs.That is one hell of a reach. The piece was clearly just playing on the dference in Harry and Meghan’s social backgrounds.If Harry had been dating a white, working-class woman from Manchester’s Moss Side, I dare say the Mail would have done something similarly silly.Another favourite is that weird throwaway line Boris Johnson’s sister Rachel wrote, in a laudatory piece on Meghan, about the mixed-race American actress bringing some “rich and exotic DNA” to the pale Windsor bloodline. That is more cringey than racist.Several pieces have cited a single phrase in a Sarah Vine column for the Mail — she said she had a “niggling worry” about the royal couple’s engagement photo — as a bigoted dog whistle. That is, quite frankly, mental.Such is the lack of actual examples of the Press being racist about Meghan.The only leg this argument has left to stand on is that the sheer volume of criticism sent Meghan’s way was disproportionate.Racism is the only explanation for it. It’s an argument based purely on unveriable speculation and imputing motives. It is also b*****ks.When the couple first got together, the coverage was gushing across the board.It was only when Meghan and Harry started on their ious virtue-signalling cru-sades — such as jetting around to lecture on climate change — that people’s backs went up.That the couple had already been beefing with the Press probably didn’t help either.In , way before Meghan became a figure in our culture wars, Harry issued a remarkable statement rebuking journalists for the “racial undertones” of their pieces.That these privileged royals, kept in the lap of luxury at taxpayers’ expense, began to develop a deep-seated victim complex only heightened the resentment towards them.Last year, Meghan told ITV public le was a “struggle” and she was shocked that “not many people have askedI’m OK”. Poor princess.This picture of privilege is who the liberal Left has spent the best part of three years defending.Even supposed republicans have — after a bit of anti-royal throat-clearing — defended Harry and Meghan to the hilt and helped con- struct this absurd narrative that they are the victims of establishment racism.This says far more about the prejudices of liberal-Left commentators than it does about the tabloid Press. They routinely suggest Meghan’s supposed mistreatment in Brexit Britain is no coincidence.They think Britain is a foul place full of foul people, brainwashed by foul news- papers to hate the wonderful Duchess of Sussex and the brilliant European Union.What the liberal elite’s Meghanmania shows us is that, for all their posturing against right-wingers, monarchy and the old aristocracy, they are comfortable with the plebs being led, instructed and hectored by our betters.They would just rather it was woke people doing it, like Harry and Meghan. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridLOADEDcustomwww.thesuncustom%Fwp-admin%Fpost.phpcustomlinkangoodt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridBEFORE_OPTOUT_REQt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridFINISHEDcustomwww.thesunt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridOPTOUT_RESPONSE_OKt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For how much did they really know about each other before walking down the aisle Prince William apparently advised his more impetuous brother to wait so he could really get to know his American bride first, but Harry took umbrage and didn’t listen.Perhapshe had, he might have worked out in advance that an independent spirit joining such a restrictive institution wasn’t going to end well.Instead, they leapt before they looked and, with the “-month bride” having packed her bags already, have saddled the -year-old Queen with yet another constitutional crisis.Back in , I wrote a piece defending Meghan after she was criticised by old school friend Ninaki Priddy for being “calculated in the way she handled people and relationships” and a “curator of a beautul le”.But following the lavish baby shower, the jet-setting with A-listers and the swt jettisoning of inconveniently outspoken family members, the latter sentiment now rings true.And, of course, becoming a member of the most famous royal family in the world was the cherry on the top of that beautul le.But Meghan soon discovered it was nothing like the membership of her beloved Soho House.The rooms are draughty, the decor chintzy and, instead of reading the morning papers in your cashmere loungewear, you have to rise early, put on a frock and make your way to some rain-lashed outpost to open the new wing of a community centre where “live your best le” sentiments, however well-meaning, aren’t required.Here’s what is required as a member of the British Royal Family: Turn up on time, shake hands, smile, say little more than “have you come far ” Repeat.Not because the royals don’t have anything to say. They do, and air their views in private.But in public, their job is to shine a light on whatever project they’re visiting, not themselves. To show — via action, not virtue-signalling statements — a strong sense of duty.And inthey get to keep their ious mansions, hundreds of staff, personal bodyguards etc without any whf of civil unrest.That’s the deal.But those still in Meghan’s social circle glowingly describe her as organised, focused, and opinionated — very much an independent woman used to having her voice heard.As Prince Harry told courtiers just before their wedding: “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.”An admirable quality when it comes to breaking through the glass ceiling of corporate le or securing the best table in the best restaurant, perhaps.But the monarchy is an institution steeped in hundreds of years of tradition, and Meghan — who claimed she “didn’t know much” about Harry when they first met — clearly thought she’d mould it to her way of thinking . . . then rapidly discovered that it ain’t for turning.Not that The Queen didn’t try very hard to accommodate the wants and needs of the newly anointed Duke and Duchess of Sussex.Contrary to royal tradition, they were permitted to keep the christening of baby Archie as a private affair and, despite there being a perfectly nice home at Kensington Palace they could have used, a publicly funded, £.million renovation of Frogmore Cottage was authorised.A “cottage” I might add, that used to be five homes but has now been knocked in to one because they managed to dodge the usual ban that prevents such moves because of the UK’s housing crisis.Shortly after, Prince Charles launched his blueprint to try to solve the dilemma faced by millions of young people struggling to find a home of their own. Oh the irony. And after all that, they now want to use it part-time as they flit back and forth across the Atlantic.Meghan is feeling disillusioned and homesick. We get it, and sympathise.But let’s not pretend, as some claim, that she’s been practically pitchforked off this island by racist bigots.This is not a racist country and, besides, the British public initially greeted her engagement and later marriage to Harry with unbridled joy.We love Harry. He’s a thoroughly decent person and deserves particular praise for the work he’s done with the Armed Forces, both while serving and afterwards.No, the disconnect has come from the fact that Meghan is still a Hollywood celebrity at heart and, consequently, never truly settled in her often boring and restrictive new role.She misses the relative freedom of her old le, not to mention her family and friends.Again, we get it. But was it really necessary to flee these shores asescaping for her le Clearly besotted with her, Harry faces the stark decision of giving her what she wants or losing her for ever. Or perhaps he’s genuinely sick of royal le and wants out too.If so, let’s wave goodbye and wish them luck.But. The have-cake-and-eat-it plan to stop being a “senior royal” and just dip in and out of duties that suit them simply isn’t going to work.SussexRoyal — which Harry and Meghan have registered as an official trademark for everything from “emotional support services” to clothing and magazines — is a title and privilege that comes with duties and conditions attached, not a brand, be it charitable or otherwise.The future of the monarchy depends on the goodwill, support and interest level of the public, and a recent survey showed that, while the majority have no issue with their decision to go, they were strongly against any continued taxpayer funding of their lavish lestyle.So— as early indicators go — The Queen allows Harry and Meghan to call the shots while keeping their royal titles, their taxpayer-funded security and an allowance from the Duchy of Cornwall, then one suspects this will be discussed by students for centuries to come as the turning point at which the British monarchy began its steady decline to irrelevance and, ultimately, abolition.MOVIE mega-star Will Smith popped in to the retirement party of a woman he last met  years ago.Anita Scipio was the receptionist at a US radio station when Will arrived for one of his first interviews as a young actor and he’s never forgotten how nice she was to him.“My favorite moments on the road are the ones where I can connect with people like @anitascipio,” -year-old Will told his Instagram followers before he walked in to the station to give her a hug.In the days before social media, someone who worked at his record company Sony told me that whenever he was in town, Will would tour the building, from post room to boardroom, giving time to everyone.He’s that rare creature, a star on screen and off.Some of today’s petulant slebs should watch and learn.FORMER psychiatric nurse Susan Evans is launching a landmark legal case to challenge consent issues around the provision of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for under-s.She argues that children should be protected from “experimental” and “invasive medical treatment”, not least because “some children are referred despite having autism, being homosexual or suffering some form of trauma or sexual abuse”.Speaking on Radio , she added that children as young as nine were being asked to consent “to a completely experimental treatment for which long-term consequences are not known”.But gender ersity advocates warn that “a loss to trans youth is a loss to all”.Time will tell the outcome of her case but, meanwhile, in unrelated comments, I note that the actor Rupert Everett says he spent most of his early childhood wanting “to be a girl”.He adored his mother, aunt and grandmother, didn’t like men, and adds: “I loved necklaces and bras and all those kinds of things.”Then, when he reached , he “didn’t want to be a girl any more. I really enjoyed being a homosexual”.The case in point, perhaps, for treading very carefully indeed with pre-teens.POLICE officers will be required to have degrees from this year – a move that could remove , recruits from the front line while they complete their studies.Sigh.

If the Government aren’t prepared to pay the cost, then the people will.”The -year-oldWestminster clock is currently silent during a four- year-long renovation. But Mr Johnson wants its chimes to mark the historic moment at pm on January when we leave the EU.House of Commons chiefs yesterday turned down  pro-Brexit MPs’ pleas to reconnect the clock’s bells for Brexit — on grounds of spiralling cost.Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said the final bill could end up being four times the original estimate, £,, because it would set back ongoing work for weeks.But Brexiteers were left furious, claiming the move has already been authorised twice in the last two months to see the clock bong for Remembrance Sunday as well as New Year’s Eve.Commons chiefs insisted they would need to give contractors two working weeks to reconnect and then test the bells — meaning Brexiteers have until next Monday morning to raise the necessary cash.The PM initially pledged to lead the fundraising charge, during an interview with BBC Breakfast.He said: “We’re working up a plan so people can bung a bob for a Big Ben bong, because everybody knows Big Ben is being refurbished, they seemed to have taken the clapper away.“So we need to restore the clapper in order to bong Big Ben on Brexit night.”Later, the PM’s official spokesman said: “If the public wants Big Ben to bong and the money is raised then that is great. We will make sure that — whatever happens in regard to Big Ben’s bongs — January  is properly marked.”Leading Tory Eurosceptic Mark Francois yesterday pledged £, of his money towards the funding.Calling for others to contribute, Mr Francois said: “I’m sure the BBC can help.  Perhaps the staff of the Today Programme could have a cake sale”. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridLOADEDcustomwww.thesuncustom%Fwp-admin%Fpost.phpcustomlinkangoodt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridBEFORE_OPTOUT_REQt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridFINISHEDcustomwww.thesunt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridOPTOUT_RESPONSE_OKt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Don’t we have a telecoms industry of our own It doesn’t say much for the Government’s privatisation of BTit is not in the running for this sort of work.What about our own Vodafone, which I thought was one of the world leaders in mobile phone technology Evendepriving Huawei of the work meant we had to wait a little longer or pay a little extra to download a movie to our phones, that would surely be a reasonable price to pay for protecting national security.And national security policy really is at stake.Yesterday the US reaffirmed that allowing Huawei to build our G network — even parts of it which are deemed to be low- risk — would be “madness” and could compromise the willingness of the US to share vital intelligence with Britain in future.This didn’t come in one of Donald Trump’s notorious am tweets but from officials working for Matt Pottinger, the US deputy national security adviser, and Robert Blair, special representative for international telecommunications policy.That they took the trouble to visit London to warn of the dangers we could be getting ourselves into ought to be seen as a red flag on Huawei’s involvement in our G network.Surely, the importance of being able to share intelligence with our most important ally should rank above pure considerations of cost.Australia has already blocked the Chinese firm from its G network.Yet here, the head of MI Sir Andrew Parker said he had “no reason” to think Britain’s intelligence partnership with the US would sufferinvolvement from the Chinese firm was given the green light.But Defence Secretary Ben Wallace underlined at the weekend that the US administration has threatened to cut off some intelligenceBritain approves Huawei’s involvement in G.He said: “Those things will be taken into account when the Government collectively decides to make a decision on it.”Our own Government — as it has been doing since Theresa May’s day — insists that only parts of the G contract would be awarded to Huawei.It would not be allowed to work on security-critical areas.But that isn’t good enough. Such is the complexity of modern telecommunications networks that it would be impossible to be sure that systems installed in one part of the network were not enabling data to be obtained from another.Whoever designs and builds a telecommunications system gains the power to interfere with it, or even switch it off, should it feel inclined.Of course, with modern communications a huge amount of damage can be done from afar.Evenwe are confident our broadband network is secure now, we can’t be certain that would remain the case.A company which installs a telecommunications network will necessarily continue to be involved in maintaining and upgrading the network it had designed and installed.We have to be absolutely sure the network is not being used for some underhand purpose.Huawei denies that it is controlled by the Chinese state, and has threatened to sue commentators in France whom it alleges have made that claim.But the precise relationship between Huawei and the Chinese state is hardly the point.What is certain is that China is not a democracy and there is always going to be a security issue when it comes to involving its industrial giants in sensitive work here.We would not allow a Chinese company, say, to build fighter jets for the RAF or to construct our radar defence system.This kind of work is rightly the preserve of contractors on whom we can rely totally, even in times of international conflict.Such is the importance of telecommunications in military and civil defence that we now have to think of mobile networks in the same light.The Government has been warning for years that cyber warfare is the big coming threat.In  it published a Strategic Defence Review which defined cyber attack as a “Tier One” threat alongside terrorism.Last November, the US and Taiwanese held a joint exercise in fending off a major cyber attack on Taiwan.At the time the Taiwanese Cyber Security Agency said it was the subject of an astonishing million cyber attacks every month, half of which came from the Chinese mainland.So why, then, is our own Government even considering commissioning a Chinese company to install a telecommunications network Of course, Boris Johnson is right to make it clear he is not Donald Trump’s poodle.We don’t have to take notice of everything the Americans say, on defence, trade or anything .But when it comes to our closest ally warning us that it might not want to share intelligence with us in futurewe let a Chinese company build our G network, we very much do need to take notice.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the last thing they want is mobs of people coming around and taking their picture.”And boat captain Miles Arsenault told how he turned down a lucrative private charter when he learned that the clients were paparazzi photographers from America and Japan, keen to get snaps of the mansion where the royals were staying.He said: “It’s hard to turn down money when you are starting a new business, but this one was an easy choice.“Canadians respect the privacy of others and I would not feel good about taking them out to take pictures of royals.”Eventhe couple moved to cosmopolitan Toronto, with a population of just under three million, it is unlikely that they would be hounded.Brit Amanda Holt, , who moved to the city  years ago, said: “I can completely understand why they would want to move here.“It is safe and private and Canadians are more politely English than English people and just don’t bother celebrities.”Nevertheless the appearance of a Sussex royal court in North America would likely attract huge media interest, not least from Meghan’s homeland, the United States.CANADA is perfectly placed to offer Archie an education with a strong nod to his British and royal heritage.A likely option would be Upper Canada College, Toronto, a private boys’ school modelled on Eton, where Harry was educated.Harry’s grandfather the Duke of Edinburgh has strong links with Upper Canada College and was on its board of governors until he retired in .Famous alumni include former newspaper baron Conrad Black and TV presenter Loyd Grossman.Boarding school Lakefield College in the province of Ontario is another option. Prince Andrew spent a year there in .If the couple settle in Vancouver, a possibility for Archie would be Pearson College on Vancouver Island.The school’s ethos is likely to appeal to Meghan and Harry’s world view.It is a United World College, one of  schools and colleges around the world in the UWC movement, which was set up to promote the principles of peace and international understanding.Built on the Pacic shore, it has an ecological reserve and marina.Douglas Alexander, the UK’s former International Development Secretary, is an ex-scholarship pupil.BEFORE she married Harry, Meghan had a well-connected social circle in Toronto, at the centre of which was stylist Jessica Mulroney.Little known in the UK, Jessica and her TV presenter husband Ben – son of former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney – are front-page-worthy socialites in Canada, where their  wedding played out much like a royal wedding does in Britain.Jessica is from a wealthy Montreal family who founded Browns, a big Canadian footwear chain.She and Ben were childhood pals and are also friends with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his we Sophie.Markus Anderson is another well-connected Canadian who was befriended by Meghan.He started out as a waiter in London’s Soho House hotel and members’ club before climbing the ranks within the global chain.In , he was sent by founder Nick Jones to open Toronto’s Soho House and it was then that he met Meghan while she was starring in Suits.The pair became firms friends and, long before she met Harry, it was Markus who was introducing her to rich and powerful friends such as the Clooneys.He is believed to be a close confidant and fixer for Meghan. A source said: “He knows everyone. He’s utterly discreet.”THE current bill for the Duke and Duchess’s taxpayer-funded Met Police protection team is about £, a year. That would soarit went with them to Canada.During their seven-week stay on Vancouver Island the Sussexes were shadowed round the clock by six armed Met officers.That meant the overall team was at least ten strong, to provide continuous protection.It has not yet been decided who will pay the bill as the Sussexes split their time between the UK and Canada.Canadian finance minister Bill Morneau said there have not yet been discussions about who will cover security costs.He said: “We haven’t spent any time thinking about this issue. We obviously are always looking to make sure that as a member of the Commonwealth we play a role.”Speaking before the Queen’s statement on Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said: “Most Canadians are very supportive of having royals be here. But what kind of costs are involved, there’s still lots of discussions to be had.”The Duke and Duchess have already dropped their public claim to be “internationally protected people” in a sign that security is proving a sensitive subject in negotiations.Last Wednesday, the couple insisted they were legally entitled to armed police protection funded by the taxpayer, with their new website stating: “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are classied as internationally protected people, which mandates this level of security.”But this was deleted after questions were raised about the level of Government-funded security they could expect.The legal concept of internationally protected people dates from a  UN convention set up to protect diplomats and political leaders.It was introduced into UK law in the  Internationally Protected Persons Act, which afforded “special protection” to heads of state, people representing them, PMs and diplomats.HARRY and Meghan are hardly on their uppers – with a reported £million joint fortune.Yet they will now need a rich revenue stream after announcing on their Sussex Royal website that they want to be “members of the Royal Family with financial independence”.Last June they trademarked the “Sussex Royal” brand in the UK for items including books, clothing, charitable fundraising, education and social care services.They are also said to be registering Sussex Royal as a global trademark covering areas including clothing, stationery and “emotional support” groups.Meghan has stealthily moved her company Frim Fram to the US state of Delaware, which is known for providing secrecy to the super-rich and low personal income tax rates.The firm ran her lestyle blog, The Tig, before she became a royal. She may now relaunch the site.The couple may also explore brand partnerships and commercial tie-ups which would have to be delicately balanced with their royal duties.The couple may also be tempted to sign book, TV and film deals.Barack and Michelle Obama signed a book deal worth £million and signed a deal with Netflix to make documentaries on social and political activism.The royal pair may also be attracted to public speaking to promote their causes. One LA agency boss says they could get as much as £, per engagement in the US.There are complicated tax implications for them on splitting le between the UK and Canada.Under Canadian law anyone who spends  days or more in the country has to pay income tax there on global earnings.If the pair spend less time abroad they will be expected to pay tax in the UK on any income earned from working in Canada.Matters are further complicated by the fact that Meghan is a US citizen. She has to pay US taxes on global earnings, no matter where she lives.Canada will not automatically grant the couple citizenship, and they would need to apply to become permanent residents through the normal immigration process.That means Harry will be entering Canada as any other British citizen would, and all British citizens can stay in Canada for up to six months without a visa, as is the case for US citizens.So Harry and Meghan’s short-term plan could simply be to travel back and forth between Canada and the UK at least twice a year – although that would risk Meghan’s application for British citizenship.Immigration experts say she may have obtained a self-employed visa when she worked on Suits.That would mean she is still eligible to live and work in Canada in any field, and that she could sponsor Harry and Archie.The couple could also qualy for a business visathey invested some of their wealth in Canada, andthey successfully monetised the Sussex brand, Canada could be eager to welcome them as taxpaying citizens.THE couple spent Christmas in a multi-million pound, , sq ft mansion on Vancouver Island on Canada’s west coast.The pad has breathtaking scenery and is popular with millionaires and retirees.According to local reports, the pair took full advantage of the outdoorsy lestyle during their break and were spotted jogging and hiking.The well-heeled island, or the nearby city of Vancouver itself, could be an ideal spot for them, given that it is just a three-hour hop by plane from Meghan’s native Los Angeles.But sources think the couple would opt for a more permanent home in Toronto, a city that Meghan knows well.The couple will doubtless find a grander property than the £,, three-bedroom home that Meghan rented while making Suits.The family couldto the laid-back, family-friendly area known as The Annex, close to the city centre.Toronto has a wealth of leafy, well-heeled neighbourhoods including Forest Hill and Deer Park, where Meghan’s close pal Jessica Mulroney lives.An even more upmarket option is the exclusive enclave of Bridle Path, also near the city centre.Dubbed “Canada’s Beverly Hills”, the area is the country’s most expensive neighbourhood, with multi-million-pound, gated hide-aways for the rich.Rapper Drake had his own bespoke mansion built on two acres of land, complete with hot tub, basketball court, pool and gym.Both Toronto and Vancouver have booming TV and film industries, which may well be a draw for Meghanshe wants toto acting or pursue a career as a director, as has been rumoured.Industry tax breaks have seen both cities double their share of film locations for big-budget US movies and TV shows.Good Will Hunting, The Incredible Hulk, The Revenant and TV’s The Handmaid’s Tale were all shot in Canada – where the changeable climate has earned it the nickname Brollywood.AS monarch, the Queen – Harry’s granny – is Canada’s head of state and appoints the Governor General, currently ex-astronaut Julie Payette, to carry out most of her royal duties there.There have been calls for Harry to be given the job – thereby giving him a constitutional role in the Commonwealth country whose citizens would then be less likely to begrudge taxpayers funding his security.A poll taken just two days before Harry and Meghan’s announcement showed  per cent of Canadians were in favour of the Prince taking up the role.The Queen and her Governor General have two official residences – Ottawa’s Rideau Hall and the Citadelle of Quebec.Prince Arthur, son to Queen Victoria, served as Governor General from  to .GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And this country long ago took steps to make that unmistakably clear.“If you’re a senior member of our Royal Family, this country cannot become your home.”It comes after Canada appeared to rein back a pledge to pay Harry and Meghan’s £ million-a-year security bill should they move there.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is understood to have privately assured The Queen his government would partially fund protection for the couple and son Archie.But Finance Minister Bill Morneau has warned federal officials have yet to make a decision on the crucial contribution amid fears the nation’s taxpayers would object.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The distinctive peal from its massive, .-ton bell is a part of the soundtrack of our public le.But sadly, it now seems likely that the advent of Brexit will be met by silence from Big Ben.If the parliamentary authorities have their way, no sound will echo from the clock tower on that momentous night.Since , the building has been undergoing a major renovation programme, including the installation of a lt, resurfacing of the dials, and restoration of the clock mechanism.According to the House of Commons Commission, which oversees the Westminster estate, the cost of interrupting this work to enable Big Ben to chime for Brexit would be more than £,.We are told this huge bill arises because of the need to install a temporary floor in the belfry to support the chiming equipment — as well as the impact of delays, for up to four weeks, in the renovation project.In the view of pessimistic officialdom, the whole idea of the Brexit chimes is just too expensive.As Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the new Speaker of the Commons, put it this week, “You are talking about £, a bong.”The arch-Remainers have, predictably, seized on the problem with glee.For them, the entire business is just like Brexit itself — a pointless, costly distraction.That negativity is shared by large parts of the civil service and Westminster establishment.Viewing Brexit with horror, they seek to prevent any inspirational commemoration of the event.So the supposed heavy costs give them the perfect excuse to do nothing, just as they used bureaucratic stalemate to thwart Brexit for years.Indeed, the Big Ben dficulty can be seen as ato Project Fear, once more, where dire financial warnings are deployed to frighten the public into inaction.But the British people did not give in to Project Fear , and they should not be cowered by more alarmism this time.The shrill negative voice of Remainers had dominated for too long.After the decisive General Election last month, that is the noise that should be hushed, not the chimes of Big Ben.Expressions of national pride are a force for benevolence and unity, as we witnessed in the recent cricket World Cup triumph.Despite all the Remainer gloom, there is a tremendous yearning to celebrate British-ness.That spirit can also be seen in the broad popular support for the idea of a new Festival of Britain, in , to extol the values of our nation.Once again, just as with their negativity over Big Ben, the pro-EU brigade sneered at the concept as nothing more than a Festival of Brexit, which could only enshrine entrenched isions.But in reality, just like the successful post-war Festival of Britain in , the  Festival could achieve the very opposite, by enabling us to reconnect with our identity, heritage and future.The same can be true of the Brexit chimes on January . It can be an occasion for joy and openness, not misery and fearfulness.Boris Johnson’s suggestion that the £, bill could be met by an appeal to the public is being scuppered by senior officials.In his usual inimitable style, Boris had asked for crowd-funding citizens to “bung a bob for a Big Ben bong”. There were signs the campaign could be taking off.The passionate Euro-sceptic MP Mark Francois pledged £,, while there was also speculation that millionaires such as Lord Ashcroft and Wetherspoon pub chain boss Tim Martin could make large donations.Officials yesterday said there was “no legal basis” for using public donations. So why shouldn’t the Government chip in  After all, the state is used to bankrolling exceptional national events, often at a far bigger cost.A reported £million went on Meghan and Harry’s wedding in .Most of that was swallowed up by security, but £, alone went on her bridal dress — which is not far off the cost of the Big Ben bongs.Similarly, the bill for the chimes is barely a quarter of the more than £million estimated to be spent on the official London fireworks display on New Year’s Eve.But before any money is handed over by the public or Treasury, the huge potential bill — £, to get the bell to chime, plus the £, cost of delays to the tower’s repair — must be challenged.In all kinds of major projects, because of weak management, contractors and consultants often expand the budgets for their own interests.We have seen that process with the HS rail link, now on course to cost over £billion, while even with the renovation of Big Ben the project’s bill has risen from an original £million to £million.On Tuesday night, one former project manager in Parliament said the estimate for the chimes had been absurdly inflated.“I cannot believe the costs you’re talking about,” he told LBC radio.The can-do, anti-establishment outlook ensured the victory of Brexit. With the same imagination and drive, the campaign for the Big Ben chimes can succeed.In fact, it could be the cue for a string of other celeb-rations across our land on January , like bonfires, fire-work displays or big screen-ings in city squares.But at the centre of it all has to be the Westminster clock tower. As Nigel Farage put it, “If Big Ben doesn’t sound, our country looks like a joke.”The miserabilists and pessimists must not get their way.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

However, as you might have guessed, Boris Johnson is still the Prime Minister and his government - not to mention bodies like the police and NHS - are still doing things that affect your le. We in the media have been covering those too - though naturally, sometimes, talk of a big bell ringing turns more heads.  So as a public service, here are seven genuinely important things, policies or stories that have emerged since the bell talk began yesterday morning that you might have missed. Who knows, perhaps some of these issues could even use £, of help. . A report revealed how a child grooming gang roamed the streets in plain sight  A child grooming gang was left to roam the streets in aposplain sightapos and abuse and rape dozens of victims, a report found yesterday. The appalling scale of the abuse in Manchester was laid bare  years later in the aposassurance reportapos, which looked at how girls were hooked on drugs, groomed, raped and emotionally broken by up to  members of the gang. One girl, Victoria Agoglia, who was aged just , was forcibly injected with heroin and died two months later. Abusers were allowed to freely pick up and have sex with children from city centre care homes, in plain sight of officials, the report found. Many girls also explicitly reported that they were being made to take part in apossex partiesapos with groups of men who plied them with alcohol and drugs. The report looked at how Greater Manchester Policehandled the horric street grooming and abuse of at least  vulnerable girls across the city. The four-hour AE waiting time target could be scrapped after the NHS recorded its worst figure on record, a top Tory hinted today. Health Secretary Matt Hancock revived the long-standing threat to rip up the promise following the election - and  years after it was set by Labour . Since  hospitals have been told to see % of AE patients within four hours. But the target has not been met since  and Tory ministers have repeatedly threatened to scrap it. Twelve months ago, both Theresa May and the head of the NHS suggested the could be scrapped. And today, Mr Hancock told BBC Radio  Live: We will be judged by the right targets. Targets have to be clinically appropriate. Furious Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth said: Changing the AE target won’t magic away the problems in our overcrowded hospitals, with patients left on trolleys in corridors for hours and hours. Any review of targets must be transparent and based on watertight clinical evidence. Otherwise patients will think Matt Hancock is trying to move the goalposts to avoid scrutiny of the governmentaposs record. . Hundreds of thousands are living without a fridge Hundreds of thousands of people in the UK are living without a fridge, a benefits charity said today. Turnus revealed the shocking figure to highlight what it described as millions living in poverty without basic white goods. The charity commissioned a survey of , people earning less than £, in December  by private research firm Dynata. Of those who responded,  - .% - said they were living without at least one of a cooker, fridge, freezer or washing machine. In all .% said they were living without a cooker, .% without a fridge, .% without a freezer and .% without a washing machine. The charity used the data to produce a rough estimate today that , people are living without a fridge in the UK. The charity claimed Tory welfare reforms since  had contributed signicantly to the increase in appliance poverty. A spokesman said  of  charities had pointed to the decision to scrap a system of crisis loans called the Social Fund in . The Department for Work and Pensionssaid people on Universal Credit can get a budgeting advance to help with similar costs.  Home Secretary Priti Patel issued a written statement yesterday tightening up the rules on less lethal weapons. From now on, new weapons systems will be banned from being used by the police until they have been explicitly approved by the Home Secretary. The move was recommended in a damning report that was issued after a public inquiry into the death of Anthony Grainger. Father-of-two Mr Grainger was behind the wheel of a stolen Audi in Culcheth, Cheshire, when a Greater Manchester Police officer, referred to in court as Q, fired his Heckler  Koch MP submachine gun. During  weeks of evidence in , Q told Liverpool Crown Court from behind a screen that he believed Mr Grainger, , had reached down asto grab a firearm. But the inquiry heard that no firearms were found on Mr Grainger or in the stationary vehicle in a public car park off Jackson Avenue in the early evening of March , . . The UK escalated a major dispute over Iranaposs nuclear deal  The ongoing diplomatic row with Iran took a new turn yesterday when France, Britain and Germany formally triggered the dispute mechanism in Iranaposs nuclear deal. It was the first time the three nations chose to enforce an agreement that requires Iran to curb its nuclear programme. Triggering the mechanism amounts to formally accusing Iran of violating the terms of the deal. It could lead eventually to reimposing UN sanctions that were lted under the  pact. Boris Johnson yesterday said he would back Donald Trump in ripping up the nuclear pact -thereaposs a Trump deal for Iran instead.  Yesterday, therevealed the UK has been accused of failing to pass on the details of , convictions of foreign criminals to their home EU countries and covering up the scandal. An error with the police national computer meant that EU countries were not told about the crimes committed, the sentences given doled out by UK courts or the risk they posed to the public. The police national computer error went undetected for five years. According to theduring that time one in three alerts on criminals were not sent to EU member states. Dangerous criminals could have travelled back to their home countries without the normal notication to local authorities of their presence. Christine Jardine MP, Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesperson, said: “UK police rely on EU-wide data-sharing systems to identy criminals and keep us safe. For the Home Office to fail so badly to live up to its side of that agreement is shameful.“The Home Office has serious questions to answer over this.

Zarah Sultana broke with the tradition of being light-hearted in her maiden speech to slam not just the Toriesapos record - but events on Tony Blairaposs watch too. In an address to fellow MPs she said: Ten years ago I was sitting my GCSEs at school. I was a teenager and I never dreamed I would be here today. In ten years’ time, at the start of the the next decade, I want to look teenagers in the eye and say with pride - my generation faced  years of Thatcherism and we ended it. We faced rising racism and we defeated it. We faced a planet in peril - we saved it. We have our work cut out but together we can do it. Ex-PM Margaret Thatcher, who took power  years ago and changed the political landscape of the UK away from the state and towards the private sector, once claimed Tony Blair and New Labour were her greatest achievement. But defenders of Labouraposs time in office from  to  point out the party introduced the minimum wage, Sure Start centres, devolution, school and hospital funding and many more.  During the election Ms Sultana apologised for a tweet five years ago that said she would celebrate the deaths of Mr Blair, Israelaposs Benjamin Netanyahu and former US President George Bush. The  Twitter post in her name published by the Jewish Chronicle said: aposDonapost celebrate the death of any person regardless of what they did.apos Try  stop me when the likes of Blair, Netanyahu and Bush die. Another post said: Those within the student movement who go to Zionist conferences and trips should be ashamed of themselves. You’re advocating racist ideology. She said the posts dating to her student days were written out of frustration rather than any malice. Ms Sultana held Coventry South for Labour in last monthaposs election, but with a majority slashed from , to . Ms Sultana also used todayaposs speech to call for MPs to set up Parliament in Coventry when they are forced to leave the Palace of Westminster for renovation work. The MP, whose family moved to the UK from Kashmir, today said her generation had been betrayed by almost a decade of Tory austerity.She told the House of Commons: I know convention is for maiden speeches to avoid saying anything members opposite will find disagreeable. But I can’t do that. Because my generation has only ever faced a future of rising rents, frozen wages and diminishing opportunities. For my whole adult le I’ve only known Tory governments that wage war on working-class communities like mine.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailIf  pensioners from Tunbridge Wells had been raped in plain sight of their carers, heads would roll. If  grammar school boys,  besuited City workers,  MPs or  police officers were stalked for years by a gang of sex abusers, it would cause legal and social upheaval.  But  poor girls from south Manchester  Girls who were poor, born to parents who could not look after them, in care, with no hope, no way out, and no prospects, girls who seem pre-destined for a le of abuse, crime, and addiction  Well, letaposs not be too hasty, lads. We donapost want to make Rusholme look bad. We donapost want to put too much pressure on the police. We have enough problems with race. These girls arenapost angels. And there might be political concerns. Letaposs just agree itaposs all very sad and shut down the investigation because we know all about it, now.The report into the Manchester grooming scandal which was published yesterday quotes one detective who helped arrest and charge a rapist who was not Asian. He said: It was a prosperous middle-class area, and they were well-to-do kids. They werenapost from the original tranche of children that were in childrenaposs homes... we were told to try and get other ethnicities.If you raped a rich kid, you got nicked. And coppers werenapost told to catch rapists. They were told to tick boxes. In Rusholme, Rotherham, Peterborough, Oxford, Rochdale, Bristol, Telford, Newcastle, Aylesbury, Huddersfield, and Keighley, the children who should be most protected by the state were hung out to dry by servants of that state. The authorities ignored, covered up, and swept under the carpet hundreds,not thousands, of horrying crimes.Many tried, and failed, to get their managers to act when girls were injected with drugs, groomed, raped, beaten, made pregnant, given abortions, and had their children taken away. But all too often, the authorities were wilfully-blind partners in the abuse. This is what happens, when you politicise the police with locally-elected crime commissioners. When chief constables get too pally with council leaders. When social workers are blamed for not doing the things politicians stop them doing. Well-funded childrenaposs services look after children. Police officers who donapost care for politics chase criminals of all races. And an NHS with the time and staff to track, counsel and help the most dficult people it has to deal with can link up with other services to see the full picture, not just the black eye. Butyouaposre one of the unlucky ones, youaposre on your own. Five years ago, Professor Alexis Jayaposs report into child sex abuse in Rotherham found that white and Asian girls were victims of men who were of Pakistani, Kosovan and Kurdish heritage. They were mostly Muslim, but included other races and faiths too. White victims were more likely to come forward, but were not treated fairly because of officials contemptuous about race, class and gender.The rapists told their victims - which included Sikh, Hindu and Muslim girls - they were targeted because they were the wrong sort of girl. And everyone seems to have taken the rapists at their word. The bigger truth is they were targeted because they didnapost matter. Black or white, they were poor. They were girls. And they didnapost matter to their rapists, the police, or the politicians.  When Victoria Agoglia died of an overdose aged , the coroner recorded a narrative verdict saying she was known to grant sexual favours to men infor drugs.Two months before her death, Victoria had reported that she was being raped and injected with heroin by an older man. No effort - none - was made to help her. And even so, a coroner said her rape was a favour she had granted. Every rapist picks someone they can control. Someone who wonapost be believed. And what better victim than a kid in care, with track marks on her arms. Britain has created a new underclass. People who, more than a century ago, were called the undeserving poor, people who made their own problems and did not observe the rules of dress, work and manners that the God-fearing, hard-working poor did.  The Victorians changed their minds about the poor, eventually. Journalists exposed the scandal of children sold into prostitution, laws were changed, slums were cleared, living standards improved. When the boom of the s was replaced by the Great Depression and everyone feared the breadline, moves began for the welfare state that was introduced only after two world wars had destroyed our class barriers.A century on, weaposve built those barriers again.There are places only some sorts of people live, eat, and work. They get less money spent on them. The streets are not swept as often. The landlords go unchecked. The schools are expected to be bad.It is those places who bred the rapists, and their victims. They created ignorance, otherness, and a world with dferent rules. Racism of all sorts festered, to the point that men of all faiths believed poor girls were easy meat, and the rest believed it was just what men like them did.The same places have bred county lines drug dealers, kne gangs, and other socially-expensive forms of misery. This underclass consists of hundreds of thousands of people, victims and criminals, and untold thousands of children who are still being raped.  Lessons were learned after the Rotherham scandal was first exposed in . They were learned again when a gang was jailed in , in  in Rochdale and the House of Commons, in  after the Jay report and again in  and , after  men and  women were convicted. But their crimes dated back to the s. The council knew of them in the s. Predominantly-male local officials, whose own families were unlikely to be victims, ignored it all and decided it was more important they got re-elected.The lessons learned are usually that victims must have their crimes prosecuted. Itaposs all but useless for most vulnerable children, who distrust the authorities, who are kept apart, addicted, or who see no way out. A prosecution makes bugger all dference to the basic problem which is that we now asks ourselves who deserves justice, and who does not.  To the short-sighted, Islam is to blame, or takeaway owners, or those of Pakistani origin. To others, itaposs the state, the namby-pamby social workers, or Labour councillors who didnapost want to upset their voting base.Very few think this is down to all of us. Since the s when this pattern of abuse began, we have ided our nation into people who deserve to do well, and those who donapost. People who work hard, and those on benefits. Those we want to live next door to, and those we donapost.We have not noticed it, but all the evidence shows we have also ided ourselves into people who deserve to be victims, and those who deserve a police investigation. Those who deserve hope, and those doomed to hopelessness. This wound on our soft underbelly will kill us, unless it is disinfected. The people most in need of help, of good schools, of education, and the full attention of all the authorities, must get it - and at the expense of those who can manage without it. The lessons have not been learned. Tough sentences will not stop further offences. Someone like Victoria is being raped, today, not because of race or religion but because more than one person has decided that child deserves to be raped. The only way to stop it is to admit that weaposd all be in that underclass, with a little bad luck. And tell our leaders that no-one deserves to be stuck in it.

Seth Van Beek received his licence after completing  months training and clocked up  hours in the air before he passed with flying colours. He always dreamed of becoming a pilot since the age of eight so his mum Frances, , decided to sell their three-bed home to fund his dream. Seth, from Preston, London, is now the UKaposs youngest licensed commercial pilot, a record previously held by Luke Elsworth, who passed when he was . He had to move to Greece for the intensive £, flight school course and is now on the hunt for a job. Seth said: Flying has always been my dream. There was nothing  that I had ever wanted to do, and there is nothing I would contemplate doing. You donapost have a single epiphany where you realise that you want to be something or do something, it comes from experience. My mum was an avid traveller when she was younger, and when I was a boy sheaposd take us on holidays to see the world. I loved everything about flying - even the fact that a -tonne tube of metal can basically be shot up into the air and fly for up to  hours. As I grew up, my love became a passion, and Iaposm so grateful that the experience of training didnapost discourage me, like training can. If anything, I knew there and then this would be what I did for my whole le. To be honest, I took very naturally to flying - thereaposs no feeling like it. When you are flying manually, you are in charge. Itaposs a big responsibility, but itaposs exhilarating, and that means flyingaposs an honour.  And Iaposve always felt safer flying in a plane, or flying one, than travelling on a bus or driving a car - though I do have a driveraposs licence! People have to chase their dreams, and Iaposve been so lucky, being able to make my dream my career because of my mum. None of this would have been possible without her - I love her to pieces! Seth left school in Zimbabwe after his GCSEs and attended Egnatia Aviation Training College after passing gruelling entrance exams in January , aged . In April , having turned  on March , he then began  monthsapos training at the prestigious Mediterranean flight academy.Though he could have trained in the UK, Seth said he chose to learn in Greece so he could break the world record - and because the weather was better.Seth had to sit  exams, alternating between learning theory and practical flying at Kavala International Airport every three months. He then flew up to five times-a-week during his practical stints, initially for just  minutes, but eventually flying for five hours over Greece. Seth also completed three theory-based courses - the ATP Integration Course, Jet Orientation, and Multi Crew Cooperation His total theory study time totalled  hours, often revising late into the night. Sethaposs average exam score was .% and he graduated in September at the top of his class, getting his licence from the European Aviation Safety Agency a month later. He said: Everything just made sense to me. I became known around the school for being a hard worker and people asking for advice. They were asking me - aposhow would I prepare for this or that apos. But I would study extra outside of class, just to make sure that I had perfected my knowledge - I had top marks in sight. During exam season, Iaposd finish class at pm, and then work until around  or am the next day, right through.  Seth said he was inspired by his mother Frances, who had always supported my dreams and told me that I could make itI worked hard. Frances, who also has a -year-old daughter, sold their home in Milton Keynes and downsized to a flat, to free up £, for Sethaposs course, plus accommodation fees. He added: She made huge sacrices for me, and I couldnapost let her down. I had to achieve, and to succeed. I wanted to be top of my class, so that I could show her that it was worth everything. The hours of study, the stress - and her decision to sell the house so that she could set money aside to one day finance my training. And sheaposs well and truly proud! His mum Frances, originally from Zimbabwe, said: When I start to think about everything, I get so overwhelmed.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailWe’re all told it’s better to give than to receive – but it now seems science has proved it. A recent Oxford University study found seven days of ‘kindness activities’ signicantly boosted participants’ happiness levels. And the more acts performed, the happier people felt. “When you’re kind to another person, the brain’s pleasure and reward centres light up asyou’re the recipient of a good deed and not the giver,” says wellbeing expert Anna Black. And it seems being nice to people could not only make you happier, but boost health too.“It stimulates the production of serotonin – the body’s aposfeel goodapos chemical that makes you feel calm – and oxytocin, which lowers blood pressure ,” she adds.“Kind people have also been found to have around % less of the stress hormone cortisol in their bloodstream.” Anna believes that kindness is the new mindfulness and says that living ‘kindfully’ can reap rewards – whether you are being kind to yourself, or to others. “It’s about cultivating a way to care and support yourself and others,” she says. Here Anna reveals  ways to add kindness to your le.  Find your why “If you want to establish a kindfulness practice and keep it going day after day, you have to understand why it’s important,” says Anna. “Try a writing meditation. Set a timer for five minutes and write: “I want to be kind because…” Start jotting down your thoughts. When the timer goes off read what you wrote. What resonates  How does reading your inner thoughts make you feel   Create a daily intention “Setting the intention of being kind every day will help it become a habit,” explains Anna. “You may want to be less judgmental of others, or yourself, or create a daily intention to be kinder to strangers or loved ones. Remember, change takes time – so decide on one intention and keep it going for at least seven days. Let go of any expectations about the outcome, instead focus on the intention.”   Nourish in natureAnna says spending time outdoors is a great way to be kind to yourself mentally as well as physically. “As well as lting your mood, connecting with the sky, the landscape and the weather is a great way to gain perspective and see the bigger picture,” she explains.Turn off your phone and take a walk outdoors. Notice the sounds of nature, breathe in the scents and tune into your body. Make this walk part of your routine. “By revisiting the same place throughout the year, you will notice the subtle changes as seasons change. You’ll also notice how your experience is in flux the same way – helping you cope with change in your le,” adds Anna.  Make a date with yourself “It’s easy to get caught up in le and not make time for yourself,” says Anna. “Think about an activity you enjoy and schedule a date with yourself at least once a week. Protect this time – make sure those close to you understand how important it is so they support you. In turn, you can support them doing something they enjoy.”  Pay it forward “This encourages ripples of kindness to spread outwards. The principle is simple: when you show a stranger kindness, rather than expecting them to pay you back, you encourage people to pay kindness forward,” explains Anna. You could try offering to help a stranger with their bagsthey’re struggling, opening a door for someone or offering your train seat to another passenger.  Spirit of appreciation Anna says: “When you appreciate someone, let them know – be it in your workplace or with family and friends. Keep your compliments genuine and give them when they’re deserved. Deliver the appreciation however you wish – a phone call, text or card – and see what happens.”  Learn to accept kindness “Many people find it easier to offer kindness rather than accept it,” says Anna. “But it’s important to give yourself opportunities to be open to kindness from others. If a person does something for you that isn’t what you’d have done yourself, remind yourself of their good intentions rather than judging them.”  Listen deeply “Sometimes listening in silence is the greatest kindness you can give to someone. Much of the time we’re with others, we may be present but our attention is somewhere ,” says Anna. “Set yourself the intention of giving someone your full attention. Listen to what’s being said, without jumping in to fix it or to give advice. Notice how the communication improves.” "},{"url":null,"title":"thoughtful man leaves clues help","story":"NewsThoughtful man leaves clues to help family find his body before going missingTommy Spinks family believe he may have left the clues behind to ensure they didnt suffer the pain of never finding his body after he disappeared in DevonShareCommentsByColleen Smith:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsA body was found yesterday in the search for missing -year-old Tommy Spink \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Toni, , was very, very close to Tommy, who would have turned  next Tuesday. She said: I found him by just following the CCTV and knocking on doors. I followed him to his last point. I didnapost sleep - I just kept getting the CCTV and we just had to keep following it.Tommyaposs phone was found just as Storm Brendan brought dangerous weather conditions and police appealed to the public who were out looking for Tommy to stop.Toni said: We had to stop the search because the weather was so bad.

The forecast suggested a polar freeze is on its way, with snow hitting the north-east, Ireland and Wales in late January before making its way to eastern parts of Britain and Scotland. But Met Office meteorologist Bonnie Diamond that the reports are based on a  weather forecast for two weeks ahead, which is too far away to make an accurate predictions. Ms Diamond told the Daily Star thereaposs no sign of oncoming snow in the Met Officeaposs forecasting system.  And while thereaposs always a chance of snow showers in winter, it will likely only affect high ground in the northern parts of the country, which is pretty normal for January. While the winter has been relatively mild for much of the UK, a high pressure system will see temperatures drop this weekend, unlikely to rise above °C. She added that there could also be icy conditions in some parts of the country. Snow charts by WXCharts, which they say look at the probability of snowfall, show the entire country covered in the white stuff on Tuesday, January  and Wednesday, January . Netweather also predicts a likely chance of snow hitting the entire country on Tuesday, January . It appears to hit in a southeasterly direction, before engulfing all of the UK.  The Met Office forecast for the end of January and start of February reads: “Through the end of January into February, we are likely to have higher pressure across the UK than during previous weeks. “The northwest will probably see the wettest and windiest weather whilst further south and southeast it should be drier and brighter with an increased risk of frost and fog.

Douglas Lumsden said now the building warrant has been granted, the “intention” would be for that work to start “immediately”.He added: “That might include internal works first which people won’t be able to see.”As well as the removal of the old main arena building, the covered walkway that connects to the section of the conference centre next to the Holiday Inn Express will also be removed.It is expected that the value of the work to be undertaken will be around £,.The warrant has an expiry date of January   and all work must be completed by then.It is understood that the remaining conference centre will be retained as well as the nearby park-and-ride facility.Talks regarding the future use of the site are still ongoing.Plans were previously submitted to the local authority by developers Henry Boot in May  for the land, which hoped to create a mixed use development including approximately  residential units, properties for commercial and business use, a recycling centre and park-and-ride facility.The application is still pending and there was a number of documents uploaded on to the site in , along with a letter of objection received last year.It stated: “The site would have been better used as a new north-east HQ and training hub for Police Scotland with Queen Street being disposed of.“There would be ample space to create a specialist training facility, which Police Scotland does not have anywhere north of the central belt.”Discussions have also been under way with the King’s Community Church over the site, with the church keen to move from its base on King Street.The church began in  with a small gathering before it moved to the city centre church in  where it has remained.An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: “A building warrant to demolish the arena at the old AECC and a covered walkway to the adjacent hotel has been approved by the planning authority.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49484539-240x180.jpg

the paper with no clues as to its origin.And, not for the first time, Argyllshire Advertiser readers have come up trumps and we now know a little more about the boat#s owner, named only as RG Mowat in the log book.The  log book gives an account of the voyages of the -foot gaff cutter #Fulmar# and the adventures of her colourful crew. Its dog-eared pages contain neatly-typed records, precise drawings and fascinating photographs.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun#, #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar. Club secretary Jenner Rollands contacted the Advertiser and confirmed CCC sadly lost all its records when the Carrick, moored on the River Clyde, sank in . At the time, the club#s office was aboard her.Closer to home, Ardrishaig man Billy Paterson called into the Advertiser offices to say his father, Ardrishaig Primary School headmaster Gilbert Paterson, had crewed the yacht Fulmar.Mr Paterson still has mementoes from his father#s trips in the form of gts from Commander Mowat, including a paperweight from , a copper and brass barrel ashtray dated  and a brass model yacht with #Fulmar # engraved on it.Thanks to everyone who contacted the Advertiser with their memories.We now know a little more about Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , owner of the Fulmar.Details about the crew of #Tanky#, #Bosun# and #Pilot# remain, however, sketchy, soanyone out there knows any more#"},{"url":null,"title":"my new year resolution is","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards"},{"url":null,"title":"plenty of christmas room at the inn","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowInveraray Senior Citizens committee hosted its annual Christmas lunch in the Inveraray Inn.The event, on Sunday December  for senior citizens of Inveraray, was well attended with everyone enjoying a delicious meal and musical entertainment provided by Lochgilphead#s Easy Club.During the festivities, the committee presented flowers to Diane MacDonald, who is retiring from the committee after nine years."},{"url":null,"title":"a mid argyll rugby blast from the past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Donald Carmichael handed in this black and white photograph of a Mid Argyll Rugby Club team of many decades ago.But can our readers name the players  And what background can you give us about this photograph and Mid Argyll Rugby club at the time Contact the Argyllshire Advertiser by email: editor@argyllshireadvertiser with any information."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event. And to Gavin #Top Tog# Brown, who has been an avid rally man for years and continued to watch us all through the lens, capturing some of our most heroic moments. was a busy year, with a few of us still tinkering away in sheds.  will hopefully see theof Ally and Del Galbraith in their #new# MK Escort and Donald Bowness in the giant killing Nova making aafter some time out.PICS:Dougie Watt and Ian Parker flying in Finland before winning in Aberdeen Photo: Jii Pihlaja. no_a_RallyFinlandFather and son duo Craig and Ross Callendar came in th overall at this year#s Mull Rally.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

It now seems that Dutch taxpayers are subsidising our failing train services. This is on top of the Scottish Government subsidies, which make up about half of its pound billion revenues.We need a viable solution to ScotRailrsquos woes, and terminating franchises early or nationalisation is not the answer.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the latest in a series of important milestones that have brought us a step closer to progressing plans for sustainable economic development."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-test-rocket-engines-former-cockenzie-power-station-site-rejected","story":"Skyrorarsquos bid to set up a base on where the sitersquos former coal handling plant stood had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application.

I was alone and deep in thought. I cannot remember now exactly what the issue was, but something had happened that seemed to be unfair, and it had made me angry.It was a windy and cold day. The tide was in and the waves rolling and crashing created a kind of meditative sound. I donrsquot know how long I sat there, as time seemed to dissolve as I listened to the sea, and smelt the salt air.Later I walked by the shore, again alone, and I remember how my mood had changed.My memory of that day fades at this point: I cannot recall what happened as I ed home. But clearly the sea had done its job in calming my emotional state.Memories are not like books on a shelf which we can take out and look at, and then . Our memories are really about emotions rather than happenings. We connect to the emotions first, our brain then does a search for the events associated with the emotion. Songs, smell, sounds and places can trigger emotion which then leads to associations with actual events.So itrsquos the emotion attached to events which will mark it as signicant. Thatrsquos why we remember the unusual moments more than the everyday ones. We remember the events when our emotions were aroused, either positively or negatively.That day I was angry. The sea was pretty much on our doorstep, so it was probably an obvious place to go to be alone, away from my siblings, to rage at the injustice I felt. But it was a good choice, because the sea has a powerful ability to heal.There seems to be a sense by some that the sea is a place to go only when itrsquos sunny and warm. In fact, the gts of the sea are given all year round, and it is winter time, or a time of storm and wind, that the sea becomes a powerful place to find naturersquos healing.How lucky we are to live in a county where we have  miles of coastline, much of it close to communities and accessible. Those with a sense of adventure and physical ability to do so can find parts of the coast to themselves, even in busy times.But as I learnt all those years ago, the sea can speak to us directly. Simply sitting by it, or walking along the shore while sharing our thoughts, can be a powerful form of mental as well as physical healing.Some take this a step further by bathing in the sea on a regular basis ndash yes, even in the winter. There are real benefits to swimming in a cold sea, both in terms of mental and physical health. But I think it helpsothers do it with you, as an encouragement! The Loony Dooks which take place at North Berwick, Dunbar and where around the coast should be a weekly event, not a yearly one!But we donrsquot need to be in the sea to feel its benefits, just by it and connected to it mentally, and yes, spiritually. This is a serious point. We have an epidemic of mental health issues, and while there is no one simple explanation or solution, we need to understand the signicance of our disconnection from nature and its impact on our mental health. Spending time by the sea is a tonic for body and mind.I think we felt this last week when we headed for the rocks at North Berwick on Boxing Day. It was here that Robert Louis Stevenson played as a boy and discovered a small cave in which he imagined tales of pirates and smugglers. The island of Fidra, said to be his inspiration for Treasure Island, can be seen further along the coast.The tide was in, so it wasnrsquot possible to see the cave. But in scrambling over the rocks, discovering other things and sitting by the waves, the sea did its magic for our family and myself. The waves were crashing andyou studied how they hit the rocks you could see how the hand of the sea had carved them in certain ways.We sat and explored there ndash not noticing the nippy wind ndash for a good hour. It was an overcast afternoon and darkness fell soon. But the walk along the beach to the town for a hot chocolate was the final part of the therapy!Our coastline is a gt for us and we need to use it, and respect it, more. The beaches, coves and clfs of our county are a true treasure. Try spending more time with them, listening and experiencing the sea, walking or sitting with it.I promise you, you will feel better, and have a story to tell.Happy New Year."},{"url":null,"title":"new-mcbrave-games-event-held-musselburgh","story":"The action-packed event, called McBrave Games, promises participants a uniquely Scottish experience with events such as tug orsquo war, tossing the caber, putting the shot, the hill race, weechinrsquo the welly and a Highland fling.There will also be a Scottish twist on challenges along the km obstacle course to test participants.The event takes place on Saturday, May , at Newhailes House.Participants can take on the challenge as a solo entrant or enter as a clan of four with colleagues or friends to battle it out to become the laddie or lassie of McBrave Games.Co-founders Jo Dytch and Andrew Hastings are confident the creativity and innovation behind the event will encourage entrants to try something new in .Jo and Andrew bring with them more than  yearsrsquo combined experience in the mass participation space on large-scale events such as Race for Le, Tough Mudder and the -mile Cateran Yomp.Commenting on the inspiration behind the event, Jo said: ldquoScotland is an inspiring and magical place.

bid for a ldquotransportation hub to the east of the town was put forward last month and sparked an angry reaction from town centre traders, who fear it will put people off shopping in the centre.The

This is a fascinating and picturesque structure from the th century, which lies semi-hidden amongst the trees that cling onto the steep sides of the slope.Dunglass is such a beautul area, and the ancient Dunglass Collegiate Church, dating from the th century, is one of its architectural jewels. Itrsquos open to the elements now, but well preserved and a popular place for weddings.The castle that once stood nearby is long gone. A more modern house sits on the spot where a mansion once stood, and before that the castle. Being on the main route south, the castle inevitably saw action during the ious times of war with England, being burned and damaged on a number of occasions in the s.But in August , the castle was effectively blown up in a huge explosion, and a version of events emerged which placed the blame on a vengeful servant called Edward Paris.It was a time of war and religious rage. Thomas the nd Earl of Haddington was leading a Covenanting force charged with defending this important route from the south, as the Covenanting army had entered England a few days earlier. He had established his force at Dunglass Castle, an obvious strategic location, to defend the armyrsquos rear.On that fateful day, August , , he was said to be in conversation with some fellow nobles when a huge explosion erupted from the vaults, instantly demolishing the central part of the castle which became little more than a pile of debris.Thomas and many others were killed, their bodies pulled from the rubble. They had been crushed by the collapse of the walls in the explosion.History has repeatedly recorded the names of the nobles killed on that day, but there were many others, as the castle was busy and full of people. Fty-four unnamed lsquocommon servantsrsquo were killed, and more than  other people badly injured, some later dying of their injuries.Edward Paris was Thomasrsquos servant and he has been blamed for this tragedy. The th-century writer Andrew Stevenson claimed Edward had the keys to the vault in which huge amounts of gunpowder had been stored, and he had been ldquoseduced by the enemies of the covenant to commit this act. He was an Englishman and another account says he was incensed at derogatory remarks made by Thomas about his countrymen.Irsquove always thought this explanation never really had the ring of truth. It was initially deemed an accident, and the story of Edwardrsquos role emerged later, instigated by a writer called William Lithgow, a man who had certain axes to grind. In one account, Edward is said to have thrust a hot poker into the gunpowder or set fire to it. The detail of this is suspect in itself, for who survived as a witness to this act  I suspect that a dreadful accident, possibly caused by incompetence and carelessness, was turned into a deliberate act of vengeance as it made a more useful explanation.Of course, it is very possible that Edward was offended or annoyed at things said by his master, and perhaps he mentioned this at some stage, later to be used as evidence of his guilt. But in truth, most servants will have seen or heard things which will have offended them, it was a part of their job.Imagineservants had been able to write and publish the things they had overheard and seen, what dferent historical narratives we would have!Motives for wanting to interpret the cause of the explosion in this way can be guessed at. It was a time of atrocity and massacre, with religious, political and national hatreds. Who was responsible for the dangerous stockpiling of the gunpowder in such a manner  It seems just too easy to blame a disgruntled servant. Even later, when writing up this period, religious and political loyalties influenced interpretation.If Edward Paris really did venture down to the vaults of Dunglass Castle on that fateful day, with the intention of committing suicide in order to kill his master, along with dozens of others, then he must have been infected with a deep hatred, as well as a total disregard for the lives of his fellow servants and his own.The truth is we will never know what really happened. But Edward Paris is a servant whose name we know. Countless numbers of so-called lsquocommon servantsrsquo whose lives and fates are deemed unimportant by history remain unrecorded just as the things they witnessed remain absent from our history books.Irsquove often thought it would be fascinating to meet Edwardrsquos ghost and ask him what really happened on that day.Silly idea, of course, but you never know."},{"url":null,"title":"public-exhibition-held-plans-revive-dunbars-east-beach","story":"Dunbarrsquos East Beach, which hosts the townrsquos annual Loony Dook, was once a magnet for tourists but the disappearance of its golden sands over the years due to coastal erosion has led to fewer visitors.East Lothian Council has already been given permission for the first phase of work on the beach, which it is hoped will help sandwhile also protecting the shore.A public exhibition detailing plans for a second phase of work ndash and the project overall ndash takes place in Dunbarrsquos Bleachingfield Centre on Monday afternoon.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, explained the desire to see the beach restored to how it was previously.She said: ldquoIt has been a long-held ambition.ldquoPeople reminisce about how wonderful the beach was and there has been a lot of disappointment that it has been so rocky for so long.Dave Northcott, East Lothian Council structural engineer and project leader, visited the community council shortly before Christmas to outline the plans.Consent is already in place for the construction of a breakwater at the southern end of East Beach.Refurbishment of the existing groyne at the same end of the beach has also been approved, alongside the placement of rock armour at the toe of the seawall.

He was said to have been martyred at sea with an anchor round his neck and was therefore regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The cult of Clement spread to Scandinavia in about the th century and then to Britain.ldquoSt Clements Wells were probably named by Scandinavians living in the Tranent area.ldquoWe know they were here because of the presence of a powerful landholder of likely Scandinavian descent, Thor of Tranent, son of Swain, who is mentioned in many th-century charters. He held extensive lands in the area and granted the church of Tranent to Holyrood Abbey.Mr Hadden said: ldquoI am sure the new stone sculptures will add another piece of culture to our area when in place to the east and west sides of Wallyford alongside those we have already.ldquoThese include the mining memorial stone and coal hutches located at St Clements Housing estate just off Salters Road, the  mining stones at the Wallyford Bing, a community woodland depicting dferent mining scenes, and also the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh memorial at the west side of Wallyford.The shapes and patterns proposed relate to the themes of the wells, water, ripples, distilling, agriculture and the sense of space and open skies of the site as it is now. The overall idea is that the artwork reflects past, present and future heritages of the area.There will also be two St Clements Wells name  per entrance in stone, either hand carved or sandblasted.The idea for a stone village sign for Wallyford is also being explored in a design reflecting the ideas of crossing a river or burn by a ford.A spokesman for East Lothian Developments said: ldquoEast Lothian Developments are delighted to be working with Susheila and James to deliver ious artworks at St Clements Wells.ldquoThey have shown real enthusiasm and creativity with the ideas they have brought forward to capture something of the history of St Clements Wells and design pieces which we hope will do justice to the entrances of the development, and spark interest from all those who will pass them.ldquoWe were very grateful to the community council for their comments and input to the designs.Elaine Di Troia was appointed vice-chairman at the AGM, Sharon Jamieson secretary and Beryl Stevenson treasurer.

Stephen sat with a full set of teeth on display, his smile was stretched broad.On the other side, Jonathans mouth was in an appalled downward twist, his head occasionally in his hands.Finally, I have seen Cats, and friends... I loved it.In general, I believe musicals to be artistic atrocities. Singing, I like. Acting, I like. Singing and acting combined  No, thank you anyway.So I had no impetus to go and see Cats the film. I have, full disclosure, seen Cats on the stage and it was tolerable because the characters sang and danced and barely talked so it wasnt a musical of the traditional, \"Im inappropriately bursting in to song instead of finishing this sentence,\" iety.The only thing that drew me to Cats the movie was the promise of two hours of atrocious film making.Im a member of a Bad Movie Club and we thrive on this stuff. The Room. Sharktopus. Its follow up Sharktopus vs Whalewolf. Would Cats be more gloriously awful than Birdemic, the best worst movie ever \"Nearly as obscene as The Human Centipede,\" ran the . \"A monstrosity.\" \"A descent into madness\". One magazine claimed its reviewers had lost all nine of their lives, another tirade said the film was \"straight out of the litter box\".The most tantalising headline simply ran, Cats: Spay It.I was there for it. A motion picture horror piece with the added trauma of James Corden. What could be gloriously worse Well, much, it turned out. Off we went, actors in fur CGI creeping and crawling through the streets of London, their digitally enhanced ears twitching as they moved through the Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats.Nothing grating so far.This, in fact, was a delight. Even the dancing cockroaches had a certain charm. Yes, at points seeing Judi Dench with a lionesque ring of long fur framing her face felt a little fever-dreamish but she pulled it off with a certain twinkling gravitas.What are the complaints  Viewers twisted their knickers over scale - in some parts the cats are as big as cutlery in other parts they fill window frames.Two women in my screening couldnt move past the fact that Jennyanydots unzips her own skin to reveal a new outfit underneath. Others have been upset that Old Deuteronomy wears a fur coat... on top of her own coat of fur.Yet more whiny babies emphasised distress that the cats had fingers. Yes, it certainly would lt the whole film to make the singing, dancing, talking cats more realistic.Bizarrely, no one seemed bothered by Bombalurinas high heels or Taylor Swts horric faux-British accent. These were the only downsides.Lack of a plot has been another incoherent grumble  Too much plot would be a more sensible complaint. Cats is a back-to-back collection of little stand alone stories. It heaves with plots, drips with them.The inidual stories of the cats are marvellous.

Itrsquos pathetic behaviour from an increasingly amateurish administration.The Scottish Government said: ldquoThe GERS publication explicitly states that it shows Scotlandrsquos position within the UK and not as an independent nation. We will ensure people have the information they need to make informed choices over the future of the country.In the same interview, Mr Mackay also likened UK Government ministers to Scotlandrsquos ldquoimperial masters, joking they didnrsquot live up to the billing.He also revealed he walked out of his first meeting with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who then asked him to go easy on him as he was new in the job.He said: ldquo I left the meeting expressing my displeasure at the attitude of the UK Government towards Scotland.ldquoPoor Rishi Sunak pretty much pleaded with me to give him a chance."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Pale and stale Labour is facing a leadership conundrum","story":"Ms Phillipsrsquos blunt repudiation of a referendum came on the same day as, and in very similar terms to, Boris Johnsonrsquos letter rejecting Ms Sturgeonrsquos request for a Section  Order.It almost looked like a co-ordinated strike on the nationalist heartland.

relied on the service were ldquokept in the dark until two months after the decision to close, and described a second consultation carried out after the council had already decided to mothball the service as a ldquotick-box exercise.The day centre was closed in December, but Lord Boyd said the arearsquos integrated joint board , which administers social care, had failed to consult families and staff before making the decision.Councillor Brian McGinley, deputy leader of the council and chairman of the South Ayrshire IJB, apologised, saying there had been ldquoa flaw in the councilrsquos consultation process that would not be repeated.Commenting on the decision to axe Burnsfest, a source told The Herald: ldquoThis is staggeringly short-sighted example of cost cutting.A council

Humanitarian Awards on January  and the Burns on the Beach celebration on January .ldquoFor  we are not anticipating holding Burnfest in the same format as in previous years but we are looking at the

Parliament in Westminster, London but for Richard Thomson, a former reporter at the Ellon paper, it was a dream come true, brought about by hard work, allied to sheer determination to succeed.For the Edinburgh-born Richard and for the most part brought up in Auld Reekie, his first week as an SNP MP was by his own admission a whirl as he came to terms with his new environment in London so soon after his narrow victory in the Gordon constituency.His triumph at the expense of sitting member Scottish Conservative Colin Clark was tempered by the gracious words of the losing candidate who said after the count: “I just know Richard will make a good MP.” - a great encouragement for any newcomer to the mother of parliaments.But despite being born in Scotland’s capital, Richard roots are very much in the north east, having been born of a lady from Strichen who married his Edinburgh-based father.Away from the world of politics, Richard has adopted his grandfather’s love of music, including being a fiddler of some note himself.He explained: “My grandfather was Gordon Easton - champion bothy ballad singer who regularly competed at festivals, and recorded several CDs.“It was from him that I picked my desire to play the fiddle.“I then went on to join the Lothian Schools Strathspey and Reel Society, touring Alberta in  and leading a tour of Argentina in .“Even at Stirling University where I studied History and Politics I was heavily into the world of music, and twice played at T in the Park with the Canongate Cadjers and had eight years with Colin Stuart in his ‘’Taste of Scotland’’ shows at Prestonfield House, Edinburgh.Richard added:“It was all great fun, but all the while I was getting well versed in the world of Scottish politics.”Richard left his job at Scottish Widows in  to become the Scottish National Party’s Head of Campaigns, and the rest as they say is history, leading to ious posts within the party, including standing in the General Election in the Gordon seat where he came second to Sir Malcolm Bruce in .Richard moved to Ellon in the same year when he joined the editorial staff of the Ellon Times. was signicant year for him in that he became an elected member of Aberdeenshire Council, but of greater pride was in becoming a father for the first time. data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill

But despite the growing impact of this crisis, there has been little meaningful action from the Scottish Government.“One strand of attracting talented doctors to the region will be ensuring that our medical schools are better linked to our communities.

Orkney has the highest incidence of MS anywhere in Scotland and indeed worldwide.Commenting on the announcement, Mr McArthur said: “MS is a devastating condition that can cause serious pain and discomfort to those affected, seriously impacting upon their lives and those around them.“This decision by the Scottish Medicines Consortium to allow Ocrelizumab to be used in the treatment of early primary progressive MS is therefore excellent news. It is something I know that many constituents, as well as the MS Society, have been calling for over many month. Hopefully, it will help improve treatment and provide a signicant step forward in the fight against this debilitating condition.“Scotland is currently home to world class research that is looking into more ways that people can manage the symptoms of MS, with a view to eventually finding a cure. By sanctioning the use of Ocrelizumab, the SMC is helping encourage further breakthroughs in this research.“Meantime, organisations such as MS Society Orkney do extraordinary work to support those with MS and their families.

The others are likely to be her cubs, but Mr Tira does not believe all of them are from the same litter.Mothers often chase off their cubs after a year, so seeing a family of them is uncommon, he said.According to biologists, the only time mountain lions are spotted together is either during mating season or when a mother is raising her cubs, but typically only three at most are seen together.ldquoTheyrsquore not very tolerant of other mountain lions in their territories, Mr Tira said.With more home surveillance systems going up, biologists are getting more images of mountain lions in their habitat than ever before, he said.copy -.

There is a rare, ­primal thrill to be found in surging ­forward en masse – a droplet in a sea of people – to champion a cherished cause. When that cause happens to be political, such demonstrations normalise the issues in play, and empower the participants.The pace quickens. Voices grow louder – their sheer numbers ­confer power on the chants and songs. Or at least, that is how it seems from inside the muggy delirium of the fray.Genial gatheringsPierce it and gnawing questions emerge, especially when the crowd’s concern lies with Scotland’s independence.Some questions are unresolved. Others have barely been asked at all. Chief among them is whether the marches are furthering the ­movement.Whenever an AUOB march has been held of late, I cannot help but be reminded of Elvis Presley’s reply when quizzed on his global fame. “Since the beginning, it was just the same,” he mused. “The only dference, the crowds are bigger now.”So it is with the AUOB events – ­genial gatherings, shot through with good humour, imaginative placards, and rousing spirits. Take the testimony of Sandra White, the long-serving Glasgow MSP and a veteran attendee at pro-independence demonstrations. Last year, she reflected on how she met a woman from London who travelled north to march on her crutches.The gatherings, reasoned Ms White, gave such people a “sense of purpose, pride, and likemindedness”. Which, for the folk involved, is heartening. But how does ­revelling in a  consensus hasten political change As a movement with a defined, unying purpose – “to raise the profile of the need of an independent Scotland” – has AUOB evolved since it was inaugurated in the weeks after the  referendum Yes, its marches have prospered in scale and frequency, but its sole indicator of success seems to be crowd sizes – a blunt measure of a protest’s effectiveness, and one which does not pass muster as a mechanism of progress.Self-affirming thrillLeaving aside some of the more fancul attendance figures that have been bandied around, only the most blinkered unionist would deny there has been an upsurge in participants. But what then Has this valuable human resource been harnessed for direct activism  Are the flag bearers also door knockers, willing to augment the visceral, self-affirming thrill of marching with the unheralded work of canvassing  Have its ­messaging and speakers changed since   Has it discerned shts in tone and mood  If so, has it been able to accommodate it It is hard to answer any of these questions, not least because of the SNP party machine’s qualied ­support of AUOB. The presence of cabinet stalwarts like ­Humza Yousaf at its events is a seal of approval, but the fact that Nicola ­Sturgeon has stayed clear, instead signalling her support on social media, is telling. Senior SNP figures know that just as she cannot ignore the marches, she cannot embrace them – not when isive figures such as Tommy Sheridan and Craig Murray are regular fixtures.As a grassroots body, AUOB ­cannot – and should not – dictate who joins its marches, but it also styles itself as pressure group, and as such, it should welcome,not initiate, a positive debate about how its supporters can play a more involved role in the SNP’s oft-mooted campaign of gentle persuasion.Given all that has transpired in the last five years, it is easy to forget the vibrancy of the Yes campaign in the final days and weeks leading up to the referendum, and how easy it was to be deceived by its energy – seduced into mistaking the noise and visibility as signs of an irreversible sht. Perhaps that analysis will be borne out. That day has yet to come.In the meantime, AUOB doubtless has a valuable role to play in what promises to be a protracted and demoralising campaign, yet now may be the time to explore whether its established brand of folk politics risks being perceived as a pastime instead of a force capable of constitutional transformation. There is power in the marches and in the tens of thousands of voices speaking as one. Maybe, however, those crowds would be best served by those brave enough to turn their back on them.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish labour party chiefs block two female politicians from competing for deputy job on joint ticket","story":"MSPs Jackie Baillie and Pauline McNeill had planned to run for the post on a job-share basis in an attempt to uny the ided party, and to focus on a serious plan of campaign for the Holyrood elections next year and local government elections in .However they have been told by the partys Scottish General Secretary they cannot run as a pair due to \"procedural issues\". - Scottish independence: Campaigners aim to raise £, to launch legal challenge against UK GovernmentMs Baillie, who is Labours longest serving constituency MSP after first being elected in , and who has ministerial experience, is believed to still be planning to run for the post, which became vacant after Lesley Laird resigned the position in the wake of losing her seat at the General Election.The role would be number two to embattled leader Richard Leonard. Under his leadership Scottish Labour last month suffered its worst general election result since , with the party losing six of its seven MPs, leaving just Ian Murray as its sole Westminster representative.Mr Murray is himself standing in the UK Labour deputy leadership contest, while the Scottish vacancy is also being contested by Dundee councillor Michael Marra.Ms Baillie, who represents Dumbarton, and Glasgow List MSP Pauline McNeill had agreed to run jointly. A party source said: \"By not allowing the two to run jointly, the party has once again shot itself in the foot. What signal does it send to members and the public that this role cant be shared between two highly experienced women, who come from dferent wings of the party, and who want to work together in a show of unity  Its ridiculous to rule it out of hand.\"Both Ms Baillie and Ms McNeill had previously said they wanted to send \"a very clear message that we need to focus very clearly, not just on , but rebuilding the Labour party, using the local government elections in  as a . - Toxic candles that could cause carbon monoxide poisoning or asphyxiation are removed from shelvesJackie Baillie said: ldquoI canrsquot sit on the side lines any longer and watch my Party decline. Thatrsquos why today I am announcing my candidacy as Deputy Leader of the Scottish Labour Party.ldquoI am disappointed that my plans to unite with my friend and colleague, Pauline McNeill, have been rejected, but I look forward to working with her to rebuild our beloved party regardless of whether we share a candidacy or not.ldquoThe future of our Party is hanging in the balance. We experienced two crushing defeats in  and the Scottish electorate did not feel able to put their trust in Scottish Labour. As a result, the Party lost all but one MP. The result has meant that communities across Scotland have been subjected to another five years of Tory austerity, on top of the more than a decade of SNP cuts that they have already had to endure.ldquoVoters lost trust in our leadership and were confused by our manesto. The inconsistent message that came from senior figures within the Labour Party on the two biggest issues facing Scottish voters ndash Scottish independence and Brexit ndash meant that the electorate did not know what the Party stood for and instead went where.ldquoIf Scottish Labour does not accept responsibility for the result and take drastic steps to change, then the Party will become a residual force in Scottish politics. My aim is to unite the Party and bring members together from across the political spectrum, in order to rebuild the Party for the future.ldquoMy membership cards say lsquoBy the strength of our common endeavour, we achieve more than we achieve alone.rsquo This resonates with me now more than ever.The deputy role also allows its holder to automatically secure a a top spot on a regional List for the Holyrood election, however Jackie Baillie has said shes unconcerned about the list.A Scottish Labour spokesperson said: ldquoScottish Labourrsquos procedures clearly state that inidual Scottish Labour councillors, MSPs and MPs will each be able to nominate themselves or one Scottish Labour councillor, MSP or MP for the position of deputy leader.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"hjaltland housing association ","story":"HAS AVAILABLE TO REGISTERED APPLICANTSWe have  x one bedroom, two person, flats available to rent.

While it is widely accepted that modernisation of air traffic control infrastructure is needed across the region, Ms Wishart says Hial’s own consultants have acknowledged that the ‘remote tower’ model was the most ‘costly’ and ‘risky’ of the options available.The Liberal Democrat MSP has now lodged a motion in parliament that will see a debate on the issue take place later this month.“It now appears clear that Hial’s management is intent on pressing ahead with their plans to centralise air traffic control services.#This is deeply worrying given the serious questions that still hang over these proposals and the level of concern amongst ATC staff.“Hial has been intent on pursuing this option from the outset, despite its own consultants identying the ‘remote tower’ model as the most costly and risky option. Since then, there has been a desperate attempt to get the evidence to fit the desired outcome.“That is simply not acceptable, particularly given the leline nature of these air services. No-one disputes the need to modernise and invest in the current infrastructure. However, this must be balanced with the safety of passengers, reliability of services and the benefits of sustaining high-skilled jobs in our island communities.“To date, the Scottish government has been happy to wave through Hial’s proposals with little evidence of robust scrutiny. I hope this debate will force the Transport Minister to think again and begin asking serious questions about these latest centralisation plans.”Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston has added his voice to calls for a debate in Parliament on HIAL’s plans to centralise air traffic control in the region.Mr Halcro Johnston, an Orkney resident and regular user of Hial services, said: “I share the concern of many people over Hial’s plans to centralise air traffic control services in Inverness.“There is real concern amongst Hial employees that they don’t feel that they have been properly consulted, particularly amongst those living in the islands. Hial should reflect on the feedback they are receiving and review their options before they commit to the approach they are advocating.“I am yet to be convinced that these proposals from Hial aren’t more about saving money than providing a better service.

With the favourable weather it was a great day for the number of new first-time swimmers and in particular the young people taking part along with the usual stalwarts.With everyone back on terra firma and changed they made their way to the Bridge Inn to get fed and watered prior to the social festivities taking place. Chairman, Billy McIlroy, said it was “very pleasing” to see so many swimmers including young people on the events th year.Mementoes and certicates were presented by Mrs Sharon Smyth and Mrs Ann Ryan to the swimmers who had taken part on the day with all the swimmers being warmly applauded.After the presentations the Chairman again paid tribute to those who sponsored the swimmers this year as they have done for many years in the past. Last year the swim raised the magnicent sum of pound and this year again has got off to a brilliant start with pound being lted on the day thanks to the generous sponsorship from the general public. The social festivities got off to a good start with Bert Kernohan carrying out the duties of compere and the music being supplied by Two Star Country. The Choir Challenge followed with the ladies out to regain their crown which they had lost last year. They went first conducted by Dana Kernohan setting a very high standard for the judge Billy McIlroy. The men followed and put on a wonderful performance under the leadership of Bert Kernohan.In judging Billy said he had to apply the “Var” as used in football and on this the better harmonising by the ladies gave them the win by the slimmest of margins which was received with rapturous applause.Next year will be the th anniversary of the event which will be a Major Milestone in its history.The Chairman thanked everyone who in any way assisted in helping to make the event the success that it was.The swim took place under the watchful eye of Larne Branch St Johns Ambulance, East Antrim R.N.L.I., Kayakers Jim Mulvenna, Marion O’Dornan and her sister Claire Corr.

Established in January , the six week project has witnessed a record  participants sign up for this year’s programme. Those taking part are teamed with fellow Slimmers in a bid to be crowned overall Saints  Slimmers Champions, .With health and well-being at its heart, Saints  Slimmers provides opportunities for regular team exercise, promotion of positive mental health, development of teamwork skills, dance and many social activities. Participants have been assigned to a team and are following a six week programme of activity. Those involved will be spin cycling in the early morning before winding down with a brisk walk that evening.Circuit training, aerobic workouts and the all important team challenges will keep everyone entertained, while the finale dance-off in the splendour of the Tullyglass House Hotel will provide a fitting celebration of the participants efforts.But don’t let the “Slimmers” reference mislead you. This programme is about far more than that as Club Chairman Jim Brady elaborates: “Our annual programme places its emphasis clearly on the achievement of personal goals for all involved. “For some that might be simply getting out of the house for an activity at a time of the year when the long nights and inclement weather may put you off leaving home. “For others it may be an opportunity to meet new people, to try something new or indeed … to lose some weight.“Whatever the goal, the programme seems to have captured the imagination of local people in great numbers since it started four years ago with some  people in total taking part. “As well as providing the participants with a range of activities to undertake we offer mental wellness sessions, a range of social events to attend and many opportunities to step outside of their comfort zone. “All of our fitness tutors are locally based and that means that as well as channelling funding towards them during the programme they also get a chance to show off their product and attract spin-off business as a result throughout the remainder of the year”.In  the programme was recognised at the Irish News Club  Volunteer Awards when it was awarded the prestigious award for best Club Health  Well Being initiative. This years programme sees participants range in age from  to  years of age and activities are tailored to inidual need and fitness.Charity features as an integral part of the programme and last year the organisers at All Saints designated the McMillan Unit at Antrim Area Hospital as the beneficiaries of their efforts. A sum of over poundk was raised principally through the team “Spinathon” at the Harmony Hub in the centre of Ballymena in February. This year a similar event on Saturday, February  will raise funds to benefit the Children’s Hospice.The club would like to thank those local sponsors who have supported inidual teams and events. They include Ballymena Running  Athletic Club, McKillop’s Spar Frys Road, Connolly’s Spar Dunclug, Tullyglass House Hotel and the overall programme sponsor Galgorm Resort and Spa. The theme for the teams this year are flowers and they are appropriately named as: The Teamkit Tulips, The Do-Jo Daffodils, The Doherty Meats Marigolds, The Fitzsimons Opticians Foxgloves, The Pizza Parlour Pansies, The Knockdene Healthcare Heathers, The Flamingo Forget Me Nots, The Sitting Room Snowdrops, the Studio  Sunflowers, The Steele Physio Primroses, the Prime Fitness Ponsettias and the Rafferty Property Roses.So over the next few weeksyou happen to see a group of Roses or Pansies jogging past you on the street give them a shout of encouragement and help them to bloom!

I am still weak but you can imagine what it is going to do for me when I fully recover.“I want to thank so many people, including my amazing CF team at Belfast City Hospital who pushed behind the scenes without me knowing, and the amazing staff on Level  South Transplant Ward who have become my second family. I have spent more time with them this year than my own family.“Then there is the team in ICU. What these guys do is amazing. The extra care they give to the very sick people is out of this world.“I want to thank Vertex pharmaceuticals for finally giving in, eventhey were slow on the mark and I was too close to death for them to make the bloody decision but nevertheless.“I also want to thank my amazing family and friends for being there from day one and everyone who has followed my story. I am just a normal girl from Newtownabbey who wanted to help myself and others with cystic fibrosis speak out and get the drugs we deserve.“It is proof that three little tablets saved my le. I hope  is the year that Nicole kicks cystic fibrosis’s ass.“I have never been more happy to be sitting in my own home like a normal person. I am going to take this opportunity to eat, sleep, relax and repeat.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"orange order says no to new decade new approach deal","story":"ORANGE Order leaders have fired a shot across the DUP bows with a no-holds-barred attack on the #New Decade, New Approach# deal tabled last night by the Irish and British governments.Previously, Order Grand Secretary Mervyn Gibson had warned the DUP that any concession on an Irish Language Act would be fiercely opposed by Orangemen.#In contrast to the detailed list of measures to promote the Irish language, references to Ulster-Scots Ulster-British culture are ambiguous # lacking meaningful detail or delivery mechanisms,# said a statement from the Grand Lodge of Ireland. #Indeed, many of the initiatives are merely reworking of previous undelivered commitments to our community. As British citizens living in the United Kingdom, we have a complex and multi-layered identity which in many areas is wider than simply Ulster-Scots. We remain unconvinced that the cultural traditions and identity of the Orange family will be meaningfully promoted or safeguarded by these proposal.#Earlier Conradh na Gaeilge had branded the proposals an #historic advancement# for the Irish language but ones which fell #far short# of previous government commitments by the Irish and British governments.The deal includes a number of provisions for the language including the appointment of a Irish Language Commissioner.Dr Niall Comer, President of Conradh na Gaeilge, said that deal was #undoubtedly historic#, however, the organisation highlighted the absence of an Irish Language Act as promised in the  St Andrew#s Agreement. #This legislation is undoubtedly an historic advancement for our community, and for those who wish to use the language, by providing historic official status, legal protection and an Irish language Commissioner for the first time in the history of the state,# Dr Comer said.#This has only come about as the result of a tireless, inspirational and bottom up campaign which has transformed how people here now view the language and ultimately how the state will interact with our community and shared language moving forward.#Ciarán Mac Giolla Bhéin of Conradh na Gaeilge added: #This protection comes in the form of an Irish language Bill being pasted into the GFA, independent from the other language legislation, as new, separate parts of that agreement. If passed, we will hold any new power-sharing executive fully to account on the full implementation of these proposals and will tirelessly test and expose the weaknesses and glaring omissions in the coming days, weeks and months. #There are some huge question marks here. These proposals fall far short of the commitments made in the  St Andrew’s Agreement, which promised an Irish language Act based on the Welsh legislation and does not contain provisions that are made for language in Wales or in the south, as was explicitly committed to by both Governments. #The complete omission of visibility and signage is hugely frustrating and will undoubtedly be a source of tension and will expose major fault-lines on contested cases of signage in the coming period. However, the possibility of the delivery of signage through language standards will be rigorously and immediately tested by our community. #The role and remit of the commissioner being left to the sign-off of OFMDFM leaves us at the whim of a veto being used against core components of the legislation and drafting and delivery of services. The use of any veto to limit, obstruct or frustrate delivery of services and rights would undoubtedly erode trust and could be potentially catastrophic for any incoming Executive.#We welcome the adoption of recommendations included in our consultation document for the centuries long overdue repeal of the final remaining  Penal Law, that will now facilitate the use of Irish in Courts the new central translations hub the right to use Irish in the Assembly, where it was previously sneered at and belittled, which includes a provision for simultaneous translation. Finally, the commitment to an Irish language Strategy has the potential to transform our community in the coming years. #We will now work diligently towards testing the glaring gaps in the legislation that prevent us from playing a fair and equal role in our society. Legal advice is being sought on several of the provisions, including the ‘official status’ provision.

Mr Murphy said public services will now face a shortfall of at least £ billion next year, making them \"extremely dficult\" to fund. Read MoreFinance Minister Murphy casts doubt over DUP confidence and supply cash payoutHe accused the Government of acting in bad faith, saying they undertook to provide the additional funding needed to deliver \"ambitious\" commitments in the New Decade, New Approach deal. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Julian Smith said politicians salaries had cost £m while Stormont was out of action - and said \"lets get on with it\". \"Let’s remember MLAs have been off work  years at a cost of £m+ in salaries.,\" he said on Twitter. \"There will be a new deal for NI as it leaves the EU. There is also a UK budget in spring. £bn is biggest ever NI talks settlement  it addresses a number of key issues.\"Finance minister Murphy said his officials were in the process of fully costing what was required but that the announcement had been made against the wishes of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.Mr Murphy said: \"The financial package claims to provide £bn. £bn of this was already coming to the Executive.\"In a statement on Wednesday, the Government said they were providing the funding to end the nurses’ pay dispute, transform public services, turbocharge infrastructure investment and address NI’s unique circumstances. They said it included a \"rapid injection\" of £ million to Executive finances, including £ million to resolve the nurses pay dispute and deliver pay parity over the next two years, as well as £ million for a medical school in Londonderry and £ million for public transport. Mr Murphy said: \"For the legacy institutions, the proposed package adds £m to the £m previously committed. This falls at least £m short of the projected cost of £-£m.\"The parties are working together to deliver quality public services for our people. This act of bad faith makes our job much more dficult.\"As Finance Minister I cannot and will not accept this and will be taking this up with the British Government.\"Julian Smith, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, said: \"New Decade, New Approach is about putting Northern Ireland’s Assembly on a sustainable footing.\"This funding provides certainty to the Executive and ensures much-needed reforms across health, education and justice can be delivered.\"Earlier on Wednesday, Conor Murphy visited the Casement Park sports ground in West Belfast which is awaiting a long-delayed overhaul. Parts of Northern Irelands infrastructure and wider public services have suffered during the three-year devolution hiatus. Final resolution of an unprecedented nurses strike which has paralysed parts of the health service was also earlier awaiting confirmation of new funding from the UK Government. The deal which sealed theof the Northern Ireland Executive includes an intention to complete planned stadia programmes. The construction of a new stadium at Casement Park was badly delayed by safety concerns and objections from residents. A renewed business case came into Stormonts Communities Department in November. It is intended to be a centrepiece for Gaelic Athletic Associationgames in Northern Ireland. The project has an overspend of £ million, a recent Audit Office report said. Building has still not started three years after the expected completion date.SDLP leader and MP Colum Eastwood said he will be raising the matter of the \"totally deficient\" financial package in Westminster. \"The gulf between the ambition of the deal and the money on the table is substantial and will cause serious public finance dficulties for the Executive. This is not, and cannot be, the end of the matter.\"I am, however, pleased to see earmarked and ring fenced allocations for the expansion of Magee and a new addiction centre for the North West. These were priorities that I raised with the Secretary of State on behalf of the people of Derry. I intend to see both critical projects delivered for our city.\"I will be raising this matter at Westminster as a matter of urgency.\""},{"url":null,"title":"gay couples can register to marry in northern ireland from today","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

With the invaluable assistance of Martin McGuinness, he brought the Provisional IRA to not only lay down its arms, but to decommission them, without ending partition.As Leo Varadkar dissolved the Dail yesterday, an emotional Adams was telling a party meeting in Dundalk he would not be seeking re-election as the Louth TD. He can take pride in utterly transforming Sinn Fein, bringing it from the far-flung margins to the centre-stage of Irish politics. He made it into a formidable electoral machine - although as he bows out, the partys fortunes do not look as bright as they did not so long ago.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetAdams has said he was never \"caught up in the notions of leadership\" but you dont remain at the top of the republican movement for four decades without ruthless ambition.He first saw the electoral potential for Sinn Fein during the  hunger strike when Bobby Sands was elected MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone.It is sometimes presented as a case of John Hume and Dublin convincing him of the merits of constitutionalism or half-dragging him along. But former senior IRA colleagues insist that he had long been set on that destination.As a former Army Council member, he may have sanctioned some of the worst atrocities of the conflict - yet without him the current peace would not be in place.Yet while McGuinness won the grudging respect even of those who despised his paramilitary past, Adams is universally disliked outside the nationalist community.As he stepped down from frontline politics, he celebrated theof power-sharing here last week. In the corridors of Stormont, where he served as an MLA for  years, there is little warmth for him beyond the Sinn Fein team. He lacked McGuinness easy charm. He always came across as too aloof and calculating. It is Adams strategising that saw him not only survive so long, but prosper. He played the long game while those around him were caught up in the day-to-day realities of the conflict.His two closest comrades back in the s had very dferent experiences. Ivor Bell was cleared two months ago of soliciting the murder of mother-of- Jean McConville. It was the end of a five-year legal battle for the -year-old who is in ill health. Former Belfast Brigade commander, the late Brendan Hughes, knew Gerry Adams intimately. A photo on his living-room wall showed two tanned, smiling young men in Long Kesh with their arms wrapped around each other - Adams and Hughes.In , two years before he died, Hughes told me: \"Gerry wasnt trusted bygrassroots and I was. He used me to up his own status. I had % faith in him. I defended him so many times when I shouldnt have.\"I never saw his agenda. He was far too shrewd, which is why he is where he is today. He was charismatic like Mick Collins but at least Mick Collins didnt just give orders, he fired shots himself. Gerry never did, not even at training camps in the South.Hughes said: \"I thought the struggle was about improving le for the community, not about certain people climbing up the ladder. It was never about glory for me. There is no glory in war, there is no glory in killing people. But for Gerry it was about using people to get glory and power. I never met anybody more .\"The IRA ceasefire, which has saved so many lives, is the former Sinn Fein presidents greatest achievement.But it is heart-breaking that what we have now - a power-sharing Executive at Stormont - was on offer in the Sunningdale Agreement in , yet Adams and other IRA leaders rejected it.In the intervening years, , people died. Brendan Hughes would lie awake at night tormented by the thought that it was all for nothing. Gerry Adams, by comparison, appears to be a man entirely at ease with his conscience."},{"url":null,"title":"watch demolition work begins at queens students union","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The -page document was published by Secretary of State for NI Julian Smith and Taacutenaiste Simon Coveney late on January , exactly three years on from the collapse of Stormont. All parties agreed to re-enter the Assembly the following day. It details how the Executive will benefit from increased funding for capital infrastructure investment as a result of the UK Government’s “infrastructure revolution”. Derry and the North West receives special mention throughout the document although the exact funding package has not been revealed. googletag.cmd.push Infrastructure funding will enable the Executive to invest in a range of potential capital projects, the document outlines, such as the A A roads Capital and resource funding for the Medical School in Derry, subject to the Northern Ireland Executive’s approval of the project. Commenting on the news, Ulster University said: “We welcome the commitments within the deal to the development and expansion of our Magee campus and the establishment of the graduate entry medical school. “These commitments will bring enhancements for student opportunity, health  patient care.” Foundation Dean of the proposed Medical School, Louise Dubras added: “Campaigning stops setting up starts. googletag.cmd.push “I’m so looking forward to establishing the team to deliver Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgeryand selecting the first cohort of students. Advance notice to all my medical education colleagues out there, Derry is great place to live and work, and Ulster University will be recruiting.” The Government will make funding available for a range of projects aimed at supporting community and reconciliation initiatives to remove barriers, bring the people of Northern Ireland together and build a safer, more secure society in Northern Ireland. This “could include” areas such as additional funding to support mental health over three years, funding for tackling paramilitarism, to support a new Executive in tackling deprivation and improving opportunity. Once again Derry was explicitly mentioned in terms of funding to support the “Derry addiction centre”. It’s understood that is in reference to greater investment for Northland’s Addiction Centre. Infrastructure  Concurrently, the Irish government has pledged to work with the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK Government to achieve greater connectivity on this island – by road, rail and air. “We believe this is an immediate opportunity to move forward quickly together to deliver on plans to complete key infrastructure projects including the A and the Ulster Canal connection from Clones to Upper Lough Erne. “The Government will deliver on its funding commitments to those projects, including a total of pound million up to  for the A. “The Irish Government also intends to take forward a review of the potential for Government support to renewed viable air routes from Cork to Belfast and Dublin to Derry, working with the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive to deliver improved connections as a priority.” The Government has also recognised that the North West region is in particular need of strategic investment, and that there is a clear argument for further enhancing cross-border cooperation and connections, to the benefit of all. The Irish Government welcomed the UK Government’s announcement to invest up to poundm in Derry and the North West through the Derry and Strabane City Deal and the Inclusive Future Fund. It is committed to exploring opportunities for investment that will further support opportunities to bring greater economic prosperity and social benefits to the wider region. “In this context, the Irish Government welcomes the development of plans for ambitious new higher education provision in Derry,” the document reads. “This investment can support more access to third-level education for young people on a cross-border basis, enable further cooperation between third-level institutions in the North West including in research and innovation, and underpin broader economic development and opportunities in the region. “The Government is willing in principle to contribute to capital investment to support expanded provision at Ulster University Magee Campus, alongside the commitment made as part of this agreement by the UK Government. “We look forward to early discussion at the North South Ministerial Council on taking forward this coordinated investment in order to deliver this vital project for the North West region,” it adds.  Foyle River Gardens As part of the North West Strategic Growth Partnership the Irish government is “ready to continue discussions” on key projects for employment and sustainable development in the region, including the Foyle River Gardens – described as Northern Ireland’s Eden project, after the popular visitor attraction in Cornwall, England. The Government will also maintain the enhanced level of funding for the Reconciliation Fund at €. million per year in support of projects in Northern Ireland and border areas, with a focus on the most hard-to-reach and marginalised communities in terms of economic and social deprivation. “Ireland has consistently prioritised the continuation of EU PEACE funding including through ongoing engagement at EU level. We will continue work with our EU partners and the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that the PEACE PLUS programme, building on and continuing the work of both PEACE and INTERREG, will be delivered through the Special EU Programmes Body in support of reconciliation and harnessing the opportunities of our peace for all,” it concludes.

Scott was a past pupil of this weeks opponents St Louis and went on to have a stellar career with Antrim, winning an All-Ireland junior title in . In the same year, she won an Ulster Club title with Loughgiel, after transferring from her native Glenravel and as a student at UUJ, she played on all three Ashbourne winning teams. Alongside her on the sideline this weekend is current Antrim player Niacuteamh Donnelly, who worked in the PE Department at St Louis and is now in her second year teaching in Maghera. googletag.cmd.push In another sub plot Niamhs best friend Chloe Draine is one of the St Louis coaches and Niamh will be the bridesmaid at her wedding on Easter Monday. “Niamh is a great role model for the girls,” endorsed Scott, who coached  of Magheras  Senior winning teams. Scott, while jokingly not identying who is who, points to the good cop, bad cop management setup in Maghera. “I have been there since  and in the first year, we won all five titles . We are the only school ever to have done that.” In contrast St Louis hold five titles, all won in the first eight years of the competition – including a three-in-row at the turn of the s. googletag.cmd.push While there is a gulf on the roll of honour, there was precious little between the teams in the group stages. After playing second fiddle for much of the game, Maghera upped the ante to grab a - to - win, recalls Scott. “It was a very tight match and itcould go any way on Friday.” In the semi-finals, Maghera saw off St Marys Magherafelt in a monsoon at Loup before Christmas, thanks to a player of the match performance from Bronagh McCullagh, as well as goals from Aimee Lennon and Clare Gunning. On the other side of the draw, St Louis took out three in a row Ulster champions Cross and Passion Ballycastle, - to -, with their goal coming from Caoimhe Molloy, a game that Scott saw the second-half of. Maura Downey was accurate from frees but the Ballymena girls needed to dig deep. Trailing by a goal early in the second-half, they upped their game and outscored Ballycastle - to - in the final quarter to set-up Fridays showdown. Maghera continued their preparations over Christmas and had a successful training weekend in Dublin recently. An overnight stay, funded by the girls themselves, came between challenge games with Kilkenny Us and Dublins intermediate side in Abbottstown. “I have been at Maghera  years and up until recently, the last four years, I never saw a Halloween break, a Christmas break or a February break...ever,” Scott said, referencing the extra training sessions with the schools teams. “I love it and I love the girls and I wouldnt hesitate to go infor them.” There are four sets of sisters on the Maghera squad including the Niacute Lochlainnand Lennontwins. The others are Doireann and Eacuteadaoin Donnelly, Katie and Eimear Doherty. “Eimear is only a third year but she helped outwe needed extra players to play a match,” Scott pointed out. “She was that keen, we let her stay. She is going to be the new Ceaacutet McEldowney – she is excellent for all the age of her.” Scott and Donnelly, barring a long-term knee injury to goalkeeper Mairead Comer, have a full hand to pick from. They are relieved Ceaacutet and Carla McEldowney came through unscathed from Slaughtneils training camp in Kilkenny at the weekend. “Sheis a big, big miss but Eimearis doing excellent in goals. She has been doing well all year and she was superb down in the Dublin game.” The hallmark of Magheras semi-final win over Magherafelt was their midfield power. Ceaacutet McEldowney and Bronagh McCullagh are a formidable pairing, with Blathnaid McLaughlin weighing in with scores from the wing. The loss of McEldowney was felt following her switch to full-back after Aisling Porters hand injury. They will need a huge effort against St Louis pairing of Bronagh Laverty and Aoibhinn McCluskey. This is where the game will be decided. If Maghera can come out on top here, they have the attack to ask questions of St Louis. In the league game, all seven of St Louis points came from placed balls andthey cant improve on this ahead of Friday night, the Corn Uan Uladh could be Maghera bound.

In economic downturn, it is the one area where we are enjoying signicant success but there is potential for much more growth. It is our duty to seek to grow this revenue not stunt economic growth by dissuading visitors. Any plan to charge for car parking here would also necessitate gross improvement in public transport and ‘active travel’, such as our walking cycling infrastructure. Our businesses pay the highest rates in the UK. Our marina fees have been increasing for consecutive years. Our businesses need respite. They need certainty and solutions to the disproportionate rates burden that they carry. We have listened to them and they are genuinely worried about these proposed charges. Moreover, many of our workers in our coastal areas are seasonal and on minimum wage. The impact on these local communities would be detrimental.The group added that due consideration must be given to residents.It is especially mad to introduce such a scheme when no residents’ parking permit scheme is in place. We know that these can be fraught with dficulty and a fair scheme cannot be established overnight.The statement added: As elected representatives, we should also be promoting health and wellbeing, especially in the dawn of a new year. We ought to be encouraging our constituents to make the best of the outstanding natural resources that we are privileged to have on our doorsteps in this electoral area. Enforcing car parking charges at ideal locations for ‘time out’ and walks does nothing to encourage fitness or mindfulness.We don’t believe that Council’s consultation has been adequate.The SDLP group added that representatives had been flooded by emails from concerned residents, businesses and community groups.The added that hiking car parking charges would only result in a negativefor constituents. The charges are bad news for business, residents and tourists.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mallon admitted he consulted Parkhouse about the move before agreeing to move to Derry City. “He was here last season and the Derry fans will know all about him so he spoke quite highly of the league and said he had a great time here,” he explained.“When he came back he had put himself into a much better position than he was in before and that’s something that I want to do myself. He came here, he did really well and he’s held in high regard since he’s gone back and that’s something I’ll be look to doing myself.”Mallon, who can play in a number of positions, can usually be found on the left wing but has also been known to drop into full back comfortably. He spent part of  on loan in Australia’s A-League with the Central Coast Mariners making several first team appearances. The Belfast man has also represented both Northern Ireland and the Republic at international youth levels, and most recently he has featured for Stephen Kenny’s Irish U side. Mallon has not played in the League of Ireland before, but he certainly knows all about it. “I know a lot about the league,” he said. “Being in the international squad you get lads who are still in Ireland all the way through from when I went away with Ireland when I was  all the way through to . The lads were still at home playing football for their local teams or for a team in the League of Ireland.”Mallon joins Walter Figueira, Conor Clford and Connor McCormack as the new faces at the Brandywell this season, and with the new campaign just over a month away from kicking off, the newest addition to the City squad can’t wait to get going. “It’s a massive opportunity and I just want to take my chance and work hard to get in the team,” he stated. “Even though I’m coming over I know that nothing’s promised so I need to get myself in the team so hopefully I can get myself in the team, stay in the team and do well for the team and hopefully we can get some success this season.” googletag.cmd.push High hopesCity boss Declan Devine is confident that he has unearthed another Sheffield United gem, and expects Mallon to enjoy himself at Derry City as much as Parkhouse did in .“He’s a talented boy and someone I’ve known for a long time,” he explained. “It’s very similar to the Parkhouse situation last year in that it’s a Sheffield United player, a very technical player, a player with flair with a fantastic left foot who can play in midfield or the left wing and can also slot in at left back. He’s a player who gives us versatility, a player who saw the benefits of what David Parkhouse did here last year and he’s a guy who wants to prove himself at the highest level. “I’m delighted to welcome Stephen to the club because he’s going to be a great addition for us going foraard. He’s an exceptional talent andhe has the same impact that the Sheffield United player had last year then we will be in a very good place.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Preparations are underway for the new season which starts in April and, although there is some disappointment that the replacement building won’t be ready for this season, members are looking forward to moving into new surroundings in . The club has a long history stretching back to  - it closed in  because of its close proximity to the Rosemount RUC barracks during the Troubles - before reopening in . Club Secretary, Jimmy Hagan, said the current clubhouse should be “condemned” as it is “not fit for purpose”. A considerable amount of money has been spent on roof repairs in recent times. googletag.cmd.push Issues with the roof and damp have been ongoing for six or seven years, Mr Hagan explained. At one point a part of the pavilion roof collapsed because of a leak. He is happy that Derry City and Strabane District Council has given assurances around a replacement building. Mr Hagan said: “The council has agreed to give us the same footprint as the clubhouse we have at the minute. We wanted a bigger club house on account of women now playing alongside men at the club. “We wanted additional facilities for the ladies and an indoor mat for the winter. They’ve agreed to give us a clubhouse with a similar footprint but with adjustments inside to accommodate the ladies.” googletag.cmd.push When September arrives the group is normally split up and they don’t see one another, however, an indoor mat included as part of the rebuild will allow club members to meet and play all year round. Long-term plans are being assessed to redevelop the Brooke Park Community Centre and the bowling club may feature in that, but new facilities will ensure the club is properly facilitated for the next - years. The club was hoping that new facilities would be in place for the new season which commences in April but they were informed that planning and design would take some time. The season ends in September therefore work will not begin until then to avoid any interference. Sinn Feacutein Councillor for the Rosemount area, Mickey Cooper, has worked closely with the club over the years and in October  he welcomed confirmation of pound, for a replacement building with a new structure. He said: “The new facility will provide proper changing facilities for both the male and female members of the club and can also be used by other local groups.” The club is presently based in portacabins but the new facility will be upgraded to prefabricated modular buildings, Cllr Cooper explained. It is at the procurement stage and he said plans will be brought back to club members for their approval with a meeting set to take place in the coming weeks. A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council advised that the plans for a proposed new building at the Bowling Green in Brooke Park will be going ahead and the works are currently being “scoped out and designed”.

Walking into work one day she collapsed. She had become incapable of processing the traumas that people living in some of most deprived areas of Europe were enduring on a daily basis.She found herself coming back to her original training as an artist and started a journey towards her own healing by going to church.Bronagh says she asked herself a lot of questions as she attended Protestant and Catholic services in Belfast and beyond.She says: ldquoWhatinstead of listening to the continuous repeated stories of Protestant vs Catholic in Belfast, an inidual had first-hand experience of visiting every church in the city for a service, simply looking and listening when going to each one ldquoWhat would they see and hear  As a non-church goer starting out on this journey, how would you feel ten years later  What is going on in churches in contemporary Belfast  How might this open-minded curiosity inform the continuous shting conversation about the city that I call home Belfast: City of Light costs pound and is available online at lulu.

I am guided by the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie also recalled the words of the very early th century Irish political thinker, AE Russell, who said: ldquoThe strength of Irish culture lies, I believe, in plurality rather than unormity.The view that national culture is a guarantor of homogeneous identity is no longer tenable. A living culture follows a multiplicity of voices. Authentic culture is not a matter of ourselves alone. Baroness Ritchie said that running alongside the Good Friday Agreement, Russellrsquos words are the embodiment of her political philosophy mdash partnership, working together, respect for political and ethnic dference and unity in ersity.She then focused on the Queenrsquos speech, issuing a reminder that it dealt with a plethora of issues, with Brexit, the environment, National Health Service, climate change and devolved Institutions chief among them.ldquoOf these, Brexit has been one of the greatest political catalysts in Britain and Ireland, said Baroness Ritchie.ldquoIt has consumed all aspects of our lives in Northern Ireland since the referendum of June  where the people voted to remain in the EU. It has impacted on identity, sovereignty and nationality.ldquoLike the majority in Northern Ireland I want to remain in the EU and realise that due to the Governmentrsquos majority in this parliament we will leave the one institution that has provided so much political, social and economic stability on the island of lreland.Baroness Ritchie argued that EU membership had diluted territorial and mind borders and contributed much to reconciliation and developing the economy and infrastructure, urging the British government to look at how this can be achieved in any new working arrangements.ldquoBrexit has undermined the principles of the Good Friday Agreement in relation to reconciliation and building a shared society, the maiden speech continued.ldquoIt has deepened political isions at a time when our political institutions were collapsed. Being a concept that is essentially about the economy it has become a major constitutional issue in Northern Ireland.ldquoMoreover, the EU Withdrawal Bill, which will give effect to Brexit, will have direct consequences for trade between Britain and Ireland and between Northern Ireland and Britain. It will also reduce parliamentary accountability and lessen protections for workersrsquo rights.Baroness Ritchie said people do not want borders either in Ireland or in the Irish Sea. She insisted they want to build reconciliation, intra community political progress, economic and social regeneration and social justice,the very factors she explained that were enhanced by EU membership and which could be damaged when the UK leaves.She continued: ldquoWe need the closest possible links with the EU. We need favourable trading terms with the EU and as a cautionary warning to the government, there canrsquot be zero trade details with the EU and then do our own thing. Borders and bureaucracy need to be lessened and a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU is required.ldquoThere is a need for access to the biggest market in Britain which takes half of our agricultural food sales from Northern Ireland which is equivalent of pound.bn. Coming from an area where there are two fishing ports, the fishing industry is looking for the current unhindered and unfettered access to itrsquos main market in Britain to continue. I support that concept too.On the wider political issue, Baroness Ritchie said devolved institutions need to be up and running in Northern Ireland, expressing hope that the current Stormont talks process will bear fruit for the local population.ldquoThat is what the population is yearning for and what I hope can be achieved to help achieve a healing process and a period of moderation.Turning to the weeks and months ahead, Baroness Ritchie said she hopes that during her time in the House of Lords mdash along with other Lords and Baronesses mdash she wants to work towards building reconciliation, fairness, equality and a shared society in Northern Ireland, explaining that this requires a plan to ldquoend ision and bring down the physical and mental walls of ision.She declared: ldquoI would hope that we can work across this House to achieve that process of moderation and peaceful politics in Northern Ireland a comprehensive trade deal with the EU to assist our economy and a plan to end austerity and poverty and ensure proper financial mitigations are in place to deal with the punitive rigours of welfare reform.ldquoClimate change needs to be tackled, just look at the floods in Britain and the intensity of the heat in Australia which has resulted in the bush fires, and whilst reference is made to tackling it in the Queenrsquos Speech, this issue needs international efforts. I believe continued membership of the EU is required to address and offset manrsquos inhumanity to our precious planet.Baroness Ritchie concluded her speech by highlighting how much she is looking forward to working with colleagues across the House on a range of policy issues over the coming months and years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Meeting.jpg","title":"Meeting called to address Saintfield sewage issues  ","story":"THE current ban on new development in Saintfield will be discussed at the end of the month when local politicians meet with senior officials from NI Water.The temporary ban was imposed by the organisation in July  after it confirmed that it was not permitting new connections to the townrsquos sewer system.With Saintfieldrsquos sewage treatment plant approaching the end of its capacity, NI Water is in the process of completing a comprehensive drainage area planning model for the town, with the exercise also focusing on the treatment plant which continues to comply with all stringent environmental discharge standards.The detailed study was ordered in the wake of a number of sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road in the town during periods of heavy rain.NI Water engineers have installed special valves along sections of the sewer network at this part of the town in a bid to prevent future spills but have confirmed that no additional work is planned until the drainage area study has been completed. This means that the temporary ban is set to remain in place.At Monday nightrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, politicians discussed the detail of a letter from NI Water which detailed that the organisation has identied a requirement in the region of around pound.bn to maintain safe, clean drinking water and address main issues with sewer networks between  and .The news comes after NI Water revealed recently that during this period, an additional poundm investment will be required across the council area.While politicians are concerned about the poor waste water infrastructure in ious parts of the district, the need for investment in Saintfield is viewed as a key priority by many concerned atthe current moratorium on new-build schemes.The lack of investment in the districtrsquos sewerage infrastructure is being blamed on years of underinvestment in the system and the failure to upgrade networks of pipes installed decades ago which are struggling to cope with demand.Rowallane councillors Terry Andrews and Billy Walker say the situation in Saintfield needs to be addressed as a matter or urgency.Cllr Andrews described the detail of the NI Water letter as ldquoparticularly worrying and said the scale of the investment is unlikely to be made available by the government.ldquoThe current housing ban and the need to upgrade Saintfieldrsquos sewerage network is impacting on a signicant number of people and has ramications for the construction industry and buildersrsquo suppliers, he added.Cllr Walker said there were ldquoserious issues in Saintfield with the moratorium on new-build having an impact. He said the sewerage network needs an upgrade and this must be carried out as soon as possible.ldquoIn the past, raw sewage has been back flowing into peoplersquos toilets and spewing out from underneath manhole covers into gardens. Such a situation is intolerable. The current system cannot cope.Cllr Walker said the problem was not with the townrsquos sewage treatment plant but the pipes which supply it, explaining that suggested level of investment required to tackle the problem is in the region of poundm.He added: ldquoPeoplersquos lives in Saintfield are being made a misery. In the first instance, the poundm needed for the town must be found. If we donrsquot get satisfaction from NI Water at the end of the month and the Assembly is not sitting, we need to go directly to a direct rule minister.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke said NI Water was making it clear that it did not have the budget to carry out the required work and blamed austerity measures on cuts to public services.ldquoI hope the Assembly will be up and running and we have a local minister in place and that there will be the required cash injection. The ban on new development does have an impact, particularly on the construction industry. The reduction on the block grant also isnrsquot helping.Independent councillor Jarlath Tinnelly said no big decisions were ever taken locally, but ldquokicked down the road forever and a day because political parties are afraid to make them.He added: ldquoThere is a day of reckoning coming for all public services and I remember reading years ago that the introduction of water charges would sort out the infrastructure problem.ldquoI am certainly not advocating that course, but the point is that these big decisions are pushed further along for someone  to deal with.

Lidl says it has been looking for an alternative town centre site for over decade without success until the Shanslieve Drive site became available, with the planned mountain rescue team centre providing the volunteers with a permanent base.Lidl said a large number of reports have been submitted with the planning application which confirm that the proposal will have no ldquoadverse effects on the environment or amenity of local residents.In addition, the supermarket giant says its development plan will regenerate a brownfield site with ldquomodern, attractive buildings and has signicant economic benefits.Objectors to the new store proposal claim that there are ldquoserious errors in the transport assessment submitted in conjunction with the application, inaccurate land ownership information, unachievable visibility spays and out-of-season traffic surveys.In addition, it will be argued today that in determining the planning application and making a recommendation to councillors, the local authority has done so without a thorough assessment having been undertaken and without being furnished with all the necessary information required to support a robust decision that the ldquoproposal to build on any particular site is acceptable, in principle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Plea.jpg","title":"Plea for opt in organ donation discussions  ","story":"LOCAL politicians are to examine how they can promote the importance of organ donation.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is working with the South Eastern and Southern health trusts on the issue, with many councillors keen to see plans for an opt out system.This means that people would agree to donate their organs with those who do not wish to do this signing a register.

The sides were still locked after extra-time and at the end of five penalties apiece when James McClean drilled Olympic - ahead.It was then left to Walsh to break the deadlock when he kept out Ruairi Fitzpatrickrsquos well-struck spot kick to seal victory before he was mobbed by his delighted team-mates.Rathfriland certainly looked the part early doors as they sprayed the ball to both flanks where Fitzpatrick and Thomas Lockhart took full advantage.Fitzpatrick, in particular, ran at Dalton Tate at every opportunity, but Rathfriland failed to take advantage of his wing trickery.The first real shot in anger came in the th minute when Olympicrsquos Anton McGrattan tested Parr, but the big custodian saved with ease.Five minutes later at the other end Dalton Tate produced a telling tackle on the edge of the six yard box to deny Fitzpatrick a certain goal.However, from the resulting corner, Stephen Hughes bundled the ball over the line when Lockhartrsquos delivery caused mayhem.Rathfriland continued to play the ball methodically through the middle where Andy Kilmartin and Hughes were dominant and with  minutes gone they teamed up with Fitzpatrick to carve out another opening for Harry Campbell, but he shot straight at Walsh.Ruairi Cunningham then created an opening for Fitzpatrick, but he was way off target as was Lockhart in the th minute. A minute later at the opposite end Jason Noade got on the end of a McGrattan corner, but headed over.It looked asRathfriland were going to take their - lead into the break as the game entered the th minute and good value they were for their lead.However, with  minutes gone Stefan Mason exploded into le. The rangy striker took on two Rathfriland defenders after picking up a long ball out of defence.He headed down the left flank and looked destined for the by-line, but stopped in his tracks, checked back, turned his markers and curled a lsquoworldyrsquo into the top corner of the net, giving Parr no chance.Two minutes later it was - Olympic and again Mason was involved. When his attempted cross was blocked, McGrattan headed the ball into Nathan Jonesrsquo path.Nothing looked on when Jones got the ball centrally, just inside the box, but he managed to get the ball from under his feet and beat Parr all ends up with a stunning finish and turn the game on its head.The second half was every bit as competitive, but Olympic seemed to have the measure of Rathfriland and were playing well within themselves until Peter Telford was given the freedom of the box and allowed to head in a Lockhart free kick to make it - in the rd minute.Jason Noade then headed a Jones free kick at lsquokeeper Parr and with  minutes played the busy McGrattan fired over after a nice build-up.Another searing run and cross from Fitzpatrick begged to be put away, but Rathfriland lacked a fox in the box and the chance was gone.Chances continued to be created at either end and with the respective lsquokeepers earning their corn with brilliant saves.However, the game was in the nd minute when Walsh came to Olympicrsquos rescue when he somehow kept out an effort from Marty Havern when the former Glenavon striker seemed certain to win the game for Rathfriland. Two periods of extra-time came and went before the dreaded penalty shoot-out took centre stage.Jones, Stevie and Jason Noade, McGrattan, Tate and James McClean netted for Olympic with Kilmartin, Johnny Roy, Nigel Prentice, Ruari Cunningham and Daryll Evans replying for Rathfriland before Walsh saved the day when he beat away Fitzpatrickrsquos penalty.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Paul Dickson, Jason Noade, Anton McGrattan, Nathan Jones, Stevie Noade, Chris McNamara, Stefan Mason, Conor Reid, Ryan Molloy.

The industrial action involves all NHS staff, not just nurses.ldquoThere is mounting concern that NHS staff are being used as a political football to pressurise the politicians to get agreement on restoring the Assembly. It appears that we are being used as a pawn in a wider political game, but the health and care of patients should be above that.The RCN is planning more industrial action today and again this Friday, with Unison confirming that its members will not be working any overtime on Friday.ldquoOur members are the lowest paid of all in the UK, said Mr McConnell.ldquoEvery time our members take part in industrial action they are losing money. But they feel very strongly about this issue and are prepared to sacrice a dayrsquos pay to make their point. It is important to remember that the ongoing strike is not just about pay parity, it is also about safe staffing levels.Mr McConnell said NHS workers have watched staff leave ious aspects of the service and not be replaced which has left the provision of health and social services at ldquocrisis point with all services affected.He said staff have tended to keep their heads down to deliver services, explaining that they are now saying ldquoenough is enough.The Unison officials said while their members continue to go the extra mile for patients, this is impacting on their physical, emotional and psychological health.Mrs Ritchie added: ldquoStaff family lives are being affected and they have simply had enough, especially as they are being paid thousands of pounds less a year than their counterparts across the water.Mr McConnell added: ldquoThe bottom line is that the goodwill of staff has come to an end. A stroke of a pen can end this dispute and will send a clear message to NHS workers that they are valued and, signicantly, equal to their colleagues across the NHS.ldquoThe pay parity and safe staffing level issues must be addressed now..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/18134062.frustration-felt-front-line-staff-according-swah-chief/resources/images/10869174.jpg","title":"four people stand trial blackmail charge","story":"Three men and a woman are to stand trial on charges related to the alleged blackmail of a male, who it is claimed paid out in excess of pound,.Paul Arthur Mayefrom Sallys Wood, Irvinestown is accused of demanding cash from the injured party with menaces on four occasions, the first of which was under the guise of payment to ldquorelease a lorry held at docks.He is also accused along with Patrick Thomas McDonaghof Tummery Road, Irvinestown of fraud by  representation, by telling the injured party pound, already paid out would be edhe in turn paid them pound, and doing so with menaces.The other defendants are Lisnaskea couple Christopher Francis McGovernand Sandra Morrisonfrom of Trasna Way are jointly charged with demanding pound from the injured party with menaces.Overall it is claimed the combined incidents occurred on ious dates between September  and January .While Fermanagh Magistrates Court was previously advised the case would be moving to trial, lawyers for the accused announced their intention to challenge some of the prosecution evidence.The committal hearing took the form of a preliminary investigation in which the injured party and two police officers were cross-exanimated on aspects of their evidence.Due to the nature of these hearings, the content cannot be published at this time.However, after this concluded, barristers for all four defendants contended on the basis of what was disclosed, their respective clients should not be ed for trial.But District Judge Steven Keown rejected their argument and held the prosecution case ldquohad not fallen short.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Even local churches will see a hike in rates with some payments rising by almost %.Meanwhile at least one bank will have their rates reduced by more than % and will pay £k per year less.Many shops in Market Street have had their rates slashed substantially, some by as much as %. A kiosk in High Street Mall will have its annual rates reduced by half.There doesn’t appear to be any change to the rates at the Meadows Shopping Centre while Rushmere Shopping Centre will see a rise of almost %.At least one outlet in Magowan Buildings will have a rates rise of almost % though others will see no change. ASDA will benefit from a drop in rates from £,, to £, - a drop of £k. Tesco Extra in Craigavon will see a % drop in its bill from £,, to £,, - a decrease of £kBucking the trend in the hospitality sector is the Seagoe Hotel which sees no change to its rateable value.The Omniplex Cinema in Craigavon will see the rates rise by almost % from £k to £k.Portadown Fire Station will also see a rates hike of almost % but Cascades Leisure Centre next door, which is due to close, will see a % drop in rates.Portadown Health Centre will see a drop of almost % in rates in April down from £, to £, - a drop of £,.Mr Farrell said: “I think this is a step in the right direction but I have concerns about the rise in rates in the hospitality sector.”He added that there needed to be a ‘radical reform’ of the ‘flawed rates system’ and called for online retailers to contribute to the rates system.In total draft valuations for all , businesses in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area have been published online.Known as Reval – this process will result in a new non-domestic Valuation List being used to calculate business rate bills from April . The Department of Finance said: “This process is about restoring fairness in the rating system by redistributing basically the same rating burden using more up-to-date values. A revaluation is not about collecting more money from businesses, but it is about ensuring that everyone pays their fair share.” Business rates are charged on most non-domestic premises including shops, offices, warehouses, factories, hotels and pubs as well as utilities such as gas, water, electricity and wind farms.The results show a modest growth in the total value in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area of .% compared to the current Valuation List which is based on  values. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary at Department of Finance said: “The revaluation means that from April, ratepayers will contribute to the funding of essential public services such as health, education and infrastructure as well as a wide range of council services relative to their  rental value, instead of  values as at present.“The growth in the total value of the Valuation List does not translate into a corresponding overall increase in rate bills. I will be seeking to ensure that the regional business rate poundage that we set is lowered to reflect the overall growth in the Valuation List. I will also be encouraging councils to do the same in respect of district rate poundages reflecting the fact that revaluation is not about raising more revenue overall from rates.”If rate poundages are adjusted downwards by both central government and district councilsthis would mean up to % of business ratepayers would either see a reduction or little or no change in their rate bill.Encouraging business ratepayers to view the draft schedule of values, Sue added: “I’m delighted that for the first time we are making the draft valuation list available on our Spatial NI . This will provide ratepayers with greater detail including a breakdown of how their value has been calculated as well as seeing the same information for similar properties in their local area and indeed for all similar properties across Northern Ireland. This approach makes the rating system much more transparent – which is absolutely the right thing to do.“I would encourage business ratepayers to go online and view the new draft values for their properties ahead of rate bills issuing in April.”Preliminary outcomes of the revaluation include:a modest growth in the total value in Northern Ireland of .% many high street shops and some shopping centres will see a decrease in rateable value, with some as much as %many of the edge of town retail parks will remain constant some of the largest food stores show a decrease in rateable value of between % and %the office sector shows an overall increase in rateable value of % andthe pub trade will see considerable iation in values with notable decreases in some pubs and signicant increases in some pubs in busy urban areas.As well as being able to view their new valuation online at a time that suits them, business owners can come along and talk to the Reval team at events across Northern Ireland to find out more about what their new valuation means for them. View the draft schedule of values at www.finance-ni.gov.uk reval--niIf ratepayers are unable to access the required information online they can contact LPS on Tel:   .

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.
