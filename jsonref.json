The family moved to Westchester County when she was five, and she went on to attend Yorktown High SchoolInitially, the young family lived in Parkchester, a planned community of 171 mid-rise brick buildings in the Bronx. When she was about five, Ocasio-Cortez\u0027s family moved to the house in Westchester County, a detail that the bio omits.The timing of the move is confirmed in a New York Times interview with mother Blanca Ocasio-Cortez, but the report does not address the discrepancy.The home, a single-story with a finished basement, most recently sold for $355,000 in 2016. The median annual income in the area is $116,741, compared to the median annual income of $48,315 in Parkchester\u0027s zip code, according to the latest Census data.\u0027It was clear to her, even then, that the zip code a child was born in determined much of their destiny,\u0027 Ocasio-Cortez\u0027s official bio reads. While attending Yorktown High School in Westchester, she entered the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair where she won second place for her microbiology project.MIT\u0027s Lincoln Laboratory named an asteroid after her, 23238 Ocasio-Cortez, as a prize.            Ocasio-Cortez with her mother Blanca, brother Gabriel, and her grandmother in 2015Ocasio-Cortez was a freshman at Boston University, studying economics and international relations, when she received the devastating news of her father\u0027s death.Her father\u0027s death came amid the financial crisis and he left no will, putting their home on the brink of foreclosure, she has said.The house was sold and Ocasio-Cortez now lives in the same Bronx apartment where she lived until age five.\u0027My mother cleaned homes and drove school buses, and when my family was on the brink of foreclosure, I started bartending and waitressing,\u0027 she told MSNBC\u0027s Morning Joe in an interview on Wednesday.   Ocasio-Cortez has said that during college she volunteered for Senator Ted Kennedy, where she fell in love with doing community work, serving as an immigration case worker and handling foreign affairs.After graduating, she returned to the Bronx where she founded Brook Avenue Press - a publishing house which seeks designer, artists, and writers from urban areas to help paint the Bronx in a positive light in children\u0027s stories.             Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had worked as a bartender at FlatsFix Mexican restaurant to make ends meet, before toppling Democratic incumbent Joe Crawley during the New York PrimariesHer biggest political involvement until the primary election was with Bernie Sanders\u0027 failed bid for the 2016 nomination - but it was not the only one.That same year she participated in protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline in Standing Rock, and visited Flint, Michigan, an epicenter for left-wing outrage over its poisoned public water supply. Last year, she participated in vigils for Hurricane Maria - which she has claimed took the life of her grandfather in Puerto Rico. She returned to bar-tending at FlatsFix, a trendy Mexican restaurant in Manhattan\u0027s Union Square. It was while she working was there that she got a call from other veterans of the Sanders campaign asking her if she wanted to run for Congress in the 14th District.

could be stripped of their franchises if an independent investigation into the debacle finds they have breached their contract.Mick Cash, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union, which has sought to capitalise on the chaos by imposing more strikes, said: \u0027Telling these basket-case companies that they are drinking in the last chance saloon is empty rhetoric from a Government ideologically wedded to privatisation and just lets them off the hook again while services are reduced to chaos.\u0027          Passengers on Thameslink and Great Northern have endured more than a month of disruption after a new timetable introduced on May 20 quickly unravelledHe added: \u0027This is no time for empty threats from unnamed government sources. \u0027These rip off rail companies should have the bottle snatched from them, should be kicked out of the saloon and be barred for good.\u0027A senior rail source has said Govia has been held back by \u0027militant\u0027 train drivers, accusing drivers union Aslef of being obstructive.But this has been rejected by Aslef, which says Govia has simply not hired enough driversMick Whelan, Aslef\u0027s general secretary, said: \u0027GTR has, not for the first time, badly let down passengers and staff with its inept introduction of a new timetable. \u0027But the Department for Transport (DfT) too was at fault for creating the GTR super franchise in the first place.\u0027They have been working hand in glove and are both to blame.\u0027One of the problems, still to be addressed, is not so much where in these new timetables trains will stop, but where they won\u0027t.\u0027Govia chief executive Charles Horton has resigned over the criris and there have been calls for Chris Grayling to quit.It has emerged that Thameslink passengers who use the service three or more days a week are set to be given a month\u0027s free travel as compensation.A compensation package has already agreed for passengers on Northern rail.Season ticket holders in the areas worst affected are in line for compensation worth up to four weeks\u0027 worth of travel.A DfT spokesman said: \u0027GTR passengers are encountering unacceptable service levels and the Transport Secretary and Rail Minister have been clear it is their priority that this is put right as soon as possible and passengers are compensated for the disruption.\u0027An independent inquiry will now be carried out to determine how this went so badly wrong and to make sure this does not happen again.\u0027We will investigate whether GTR have breached their contracts and we won\u0027t hesitate to take tough action against them if they are found negligent.\u0027Govia has declined to comment on reports about the possible loss of its franchises but said it was \u0027sorry for the disruption.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/02/00/4DD48C1A00000578-0-image-m-11_1530489452096.jpg","title":"Woman Fest Britains female festival","story":"    Women Fest, in August, will feature basket-weaving, feminist debates and a \u0027women circle\u0027She added the festival aims to give women space, without men, to share experiences and ideas.

The lions were poisoned and then mutilated in a vicious attack in Pretoria on Saturday          The lions were killed by throwing chickens laced with poison over the fence of the wildlife park          One of the butchered lions who were killed so their body parts could be used for black magicChrista said: \u0027At that stage I did not connect the incident at all with the lions.\u0027It was only when the worker in charge of feeding the lions shouted in shock around 7am when he discovered the remains of the butchered lions in their compounds.\u0027You cannot imagine the gruesomeness of the scene. I had the workers take their bodies and burn the remains that afternoon. It was the saddest day of my life\u0027.The South African Police Service, who are investigating, said the suspects threw chickens heavily laced with poison over the electric fences to kill the six lions.Christa said: \u0027None of the fences were cut and they bypassed the electric fences so I am convinced it is an inside job but our security company has a lot of information.\u0027It is so heart breaking as these lions were raised from cubs and bottle fed and then people come and do this to use their bones and claws and teeth for witchcraft.\u0027It is just so sad and I keep asking myself why they have come here and done this.\u0027          Animal park owner Christa Saayman, 55, who lost six of her lions at the weekend          Aslem, one of the popular lions at the predator park who was butchered in the vicious attackLion whisperer Charmaine Joubert, who was like a mother to the butchered lions, said she could not describe how she felt, saying: \u0027I loved all of them dearly.\u0027I spend much of my free time playing with them and was with them last week and were were playing together. They were my children, my life, I am shattered\u0027.Limpopo police said they had launched a manhunt for the suspects.Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said: \u0027An employee noticed bloodstains followed by the gruesome discovery of four lions dead with their heads and paws chopped off.The two lion cubs were also dead but with no missing body parts\u0027.A traditional healer from Limpopo who would not give her name said:\u0027The lion body parts are used to make strong muti which is a witchcraft potion to cast spells.\u0027This can be used to protect a person from illness or to make them strong or virile.\u0027It can be used by a person to scare their enemies or protect them from attack or the potions can be made to make a person strong or respected or feared by others.\u0027          Aiden, another of the lions at the wildlife park who had been popular with visitors Dr Kelly Marnewick of the Endangered Wildlife Trust has been keeping a close track of mutilated lions poached and killed on private breeding farms and sanctuaries.She said:\u0027Mostly it is the claws, heads and teeth of the lions the poachers are after. It is a relatively new occurrence and it is something we are watching closely.\u0027In 2017 there were 22 captive lions poached on farms where lions are used to being fed. They are vulnerable and it\u0027s an easy way to get your hands on lion parts\u0027.It is feared that lion bones are also being used to replace the far rarer tiger bones in South East Asia and are being smuggled out for use in traditional medicines.A complete lion skeleton can be bought in South Africa for £1000 but in Vietnam it is worth £50,000 and the inidual claws and teeth of the lion are highly prized.In April lion park owner Gert Claasens, 48, had three of his lions butchered for heads and claws and three stolen to be butchered later in Petrus Steyn in the Free State.The following month Justin Fernandes, 32, had 3 lions and a rare golden tabby tiger killed by poachers at the Jugomaro Predator Park in Limpopo for their body parts.Christa, 55, who has a 1000 acre animal park which has 53 tigers and 10 lions along with 350 monkey and birds said:\u0027We are trying to conserve and save animals.\u0027But then these people come along and do these terrible things to them\u0027 she said.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/02/11/4DB9370100000578-5908495-Donald_Trump_right_and_Kim_Jong_un_reached_an_agreement_on_denuc-a-1_1530528677683.jpg","title":"US plan dismantle North Korea nuclear program year","story":"    U.S. National security adviser John Bolton said the process could be nearly completed \u0027within a year\u0027          Donald Trump (right) and Kim Jong-un reached an agreement on denuclearization in Singapore last monthFollow-up talks are scheduled to take place imminently between US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and North Korean officials following a successful meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore last month. The Financial Times reported that Pompeo was due to visit North Korea this week but the State Department has not confirmed any travel plans. Some experts disputed Bolton\u0027s optimistic time frame for decommissioning the North\u0027s weapons.\u0027It would be physically possible to dismantle the bulk of North Korea\u0027s programs within a year,\u0027 said Thomas Countryman, the State Department\u0027s top arms control officer under President Barack Obama.\u0027I do not believe it would be possible to verify full dismantlement within a year, nor have I yet seen evidence of a firm DPRK decision to undertake full dismantlement.\u0027Last week, 38 North, a website run by the Johns Hopkins University, said satellite imagery showed the North had been upgrading its Yongbyon nuclear complex.Michael Cohen tells ABC his family and the country now have...Comedian who hoaxed Trump with a prank call hires Stormy...Leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador wins the Mexican...Share this article    A satellite image published last week shows what is claimed to be ongoing uranium enrichment at a North Korean nuclear facility on June 21\u0027None of this activity technically violates any agreement Kim may have made,\u0027 said Vipin Narang, an associate professor at MIT\u0027s security studies Programme.\u0027What it suggests is that Kim has no intention of surrendering his nuclear weapons.\u0027Kim agreed at the June 12 summit to \u0027work toward denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula,\u0027 but the joint statement released after the meeting gave no details on how or when Pyongyang might forsake its nuclear and missile programmes.Siegfried Hecker, a nuclear scientist and Stanford University professor, has predicted it would take around 10 years to dismantle and clean up a substantial part of North Korea\u0027s Yongbyon nuclear site.Bolton refused to comment on intelligence matters but the United States was going into nuclear negotiations aware of Pyongyang\u0027s failure to live up to its promises in the past.\u0027There\u0027s not any starry-eyed feeling among the group doing this,\u0027 he said. \u0027We\u0027re well aware of what the North Koreans have done in the past.\u0027           US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is due to meet North Korean officials imminently to discuss how the process will take place"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/22/05/4D82579100000578-0-image-a-8_1529641792469.jpg","title":"Woman bought lettuce gets shock finds frog lurking leaves","story":"    A green frog is seen in the British round lettuce, which was brought from an Aldi shop in RedruthIn March, the shopper said she also found a stone in her chunky beef soup from Aldi.Mrs Tolputt has praised the shop for its handling of the situation and that she can see the \u0027funny side of it\u0027. The 37-year-old shared a video showing the frog sat on top of the lettuce on social media. She added: \u0027I saw something move and there was a little pair of eyes looking back at me.

AMLO was then a member of the PRI party, led by President Enrique Pena Nieto, but quit in the late 1980s.After losing the Tabasco governor’s race twice, he staged protests in an attempt to raise his profile during a time in which there was increasing resistance towards the leading party. However, in 2000, AMLO was elected as the mayor of Mexico City as part of the PRD.With his first bid at the presidency in 2006, he promised to ‘put the poor first’, but his critics branded him ‘a danger for Mexico’, likening him to Venezuela’s President Hugo Chavez. The election was decided by a thin margin and López Obrador claimed it had been rigged.          Mexico City\u0027s main square, the Zocalo, as Andrés Manuel López Obrador delivers his speechAMLO led protests yet again and declared that he was the legitimate president of Mexico. This led to the former Mayor speaking in villages that had not been visited by political leaders for years.One of his aides, Polimnia Romana Sierra said: ‘He spoke with the same energy under a tree in front of 10 people as he did in the full Zocalo. Nobody works the microphone like him.’He formed a new party, the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) and by 2015, he was regarded as the next election winner. In addition to this, as the PRI became increasingly involved in corruption scandals, López Obrador also grew in popularity.His wife and fervent feminist, Beatriz Gutierrez, also helped to extend his appeal to female voters in Mexico.          AMLO, accompanied by wife Beatriz Gutierrez Muller, delivers his victory speech in MexicoAndrés Manuel López Obrador\u0027s policiesAfter winning the Mexican election, Andrés Manuel López Obrador must now ensure that his promises are fulfilled. Despite critics comparing AMLO to Hugo Chavez and his leftist sympathies could turn Mexico into Venezuela, he took home a landslide victory.According to the BBC, many believe that he shares an authoritarian approach and will ruin the economy, but AMLO has rejected these claims and has said that he will not carry out expropriations and will not seek re-election.However, he has promised to renew contracts awarded by the state oil company Pemex to private companies during the administration of President Enrique Pena Nieto and will check they are not corrupt. He has also vowed to bring economic growth, jobs and social development programmes.‘We will carry out a peaceful transformation, ordered, but profound and even radical, because the word radical comes from root, and what we will do... is, in essence, to root out the corrupt regime,’ he said at one campaign rally.Against what he describes as the ‘power mafia’ of Mexico, he plans to increase scholarships for the young and expand welfare for the elderly, offering ‘good relations’ with the private sector and accusing business leaders of acting ‘like they owned Mexico’.AMLO has also promised to bring peace to the war on drugs, but will not continue the military-led strategy. Notably, he has also said that he would not let Mexico bow down to Trump and asked for ‘friendship’ and ‘mutual respect’ to avoid any trade war.\u0027Soon, very soon, after the victory of our movement, we will defend migrants all over the American continent and the migrants of the world who, by necessity, must abandon their towns to find life in the United States it\u0027s a human right we will defend,\u0027 Lopez Obrador said in a June speech reported by El Universal.US President Donald Trump congratulated Lopez Obrador in a tweet saying: \u0027Congratulations to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on becoming the next President of Mexico.

at the White House with First Lady Melania yesterday) is expected to heap pressure on NATO members to spend more at what could be a bad-tempered summit next week          In a letter to his British counterpart, Defence Secretary Jim Mattis (pictured) suggested the UK might not continue to be a \u0027global actor\u0027 unless funding was increased           Just six NATO countries meet the 2 per cent of GDP target for spending on their military forcesDonald Trump is expected to heap pressure on NATO members to spend more at what could be a bad-tempered summit next week.  In the missive, seen by The Sun, General Mattis told Mr Williamson that Washington is \u0027concerned\u0027 the UK\u0027s forces and diplomatic influence are \u0027at risk of erosion\u0027.He said he wanted Britain to remain America\u0027s \u0027partner of choice\u0027 - but added that the French were committed to being \u0027global actors\u0027 alongside the US. Mr Trump will travel to Europe next week for a potentially stormy NATO gathering on July 11-12, before heading to the UK.In the two-page letter, Gen Mattis said \u0027the credibility of the UK\u0027s armed forces\u0027 had been crucial in securing its place on the world stage.David Cameron DID ask Barack Obama to warn that Brexit would...Tory Brexit war catches fire as minister demands \u0027insolent\u0027...Share this articleBut he added: \u0027I am concerned that your ability to continue to provide this critical military foundation for diplomatic success is at risk of erosion, while together we face a world awash with change.\u0027The UK is committed to meeting the Nato target of spending 2 per cent of GDP on defence, but the US hinted that it wants Mrs May to commit more money.Gen Mattis said: \u0027A global nation like the UK, with interests and commitments around the world, will require a level of defence spending beyond what we would expect from allies with only regional interests.\u0027Absent a vibrant military arm, world peace and stability would be at further risk.\u0027Highlighting Mr Macron\u0027s recent pledge to pump an extra £260billion into defence by 2025, Gen Mattis said: \u0027As global actors, France and the US have concluded that now is the time to significantly increase our investment in defence.\u0027Other allies are following suit.\u0027          The letter has been leaked as Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson (pictured left with Mrs May and her husband Philip at an Armed Forces Day event over the weekend) lobbies hard for his budget to be expanded    Mr Trump and French president Emmanuel Macron (pictured together at the White House in April) have struck up a close rapportHe stressed that it was \u0027in the best interest of both our nations for the UK to remain the US partner of choice\u0027 but \u0027in that spirit, the UK will need to invest and maintain robust military capability\u0027.In a reference to the Whitehall rows over funding, Gen Mattis added: \u0027It is not for me to tell you how to prioritise your domestic spending priorities, but I hope the UK will soon be able to share with us a clear, and fully funded, forward defence blueprint that will allow me to plan our own future engagement with you from a position of strength and confidence.\u0027Downing Street tried to play down the row, insisting Britain has the \u0027biggest defence budget in Europe and the second biggest in Nato\u0027.‘I would point to the Nato Secretary General following his meeting with the PM where he said he appreciates Britain’s commitment and leadership in the Alliance,\u0027 the PM\u0027s spokesman said.‘The UK is above the 2 per cent contribution and we have said we will continue to meet that target.‘We, the US and France are close allies and partners willing to take action together in defence of our values.’However, the spokesman refused to state that the UK would continue to have the largest defence budget in Europe.   The week after receiving the letter, Mr Williamson told MPs that US patience over European defence spending was wearing thin.\u0027We can\u0027t continue to expect US taxpayers to keep picking up the tab for European defence indefinitely, nor can we expect US patience to last forever,\u0027 he said on June 20.The Commons Defence Committee has also called for a significant funding boost, moving the level of defence spending up from 2 per cent to 3 per cent of total GDP.A cash injection on this scale would equate to additional funding of around £20billion a year and bring investment in defence to levels similar to those seen between the end of the Cold War and the mid-1990s."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/02/13/4DD6ABFA00000578-5909173-The_27_year_old_princess_a_relative_of_Emperor_Akihito_will_marr-m-3_1530533285778.jpg","title":"Pictured

But he vows to reduce inequality, improve pay and welfare spending and run a tight budget.Lopez Obrador was by no means the only candidate to lambaste Trump, with all three contenders signaling their opposition to the US president.But his rivals warned that a victory by leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador could set the country back decades with an interventionist economic policy.             The leftist presidential candidate of the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, casts his ballot on Sunday in Mexico City          Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador waves after voting as part of the Mexico 2018 Presidential Election on Sunday.

But it has emerged that some of those jobs will be based in Frankfurt, although technically the iniduals would be employed by the Irish unit, according to a report from Reuters. Most are expected to be hired locally rather than physically moved from London. It is understood that the roles affected are in the bank’s euro trading team. The shift will allow Barclays to continue trading in euros with European clients even if the UK leaves the EU in March 2019 with no trade deal or transition agreement. The Barclays chief executive, Jes Staley, said last year that he saw no reason to shift many British jobs to Europe as a result of Brexit and described the restructuring required leaving the EU as straightforward compared with other challenges faced by the bank.A spokesman for Barclays declined to comment. There has been intense speculation about the number of jobs that will be lost in the finance industry, which currently employs 1.1 million people in the UK, as a result of Brexit.Initial forecasts were for about 10,000 job losses, but in March a Reuters poll of 119 finance firms found that the eventual reduction may be only half that number.

Trump claims a win – but will struggling Wisconsin benefit?by  Dominic Rushe in Racine County, WisconsinWisconsinites joke that there are two seasons in Wisconsin: winter and construction. As traffic crawls down the Interstate 94, sandwiched between endless columns of orange cones, construction is in full bloom.Mount Pleasant, a sleepy village of about 26,000 people in Racine County, halfway between Milwaukee and Chicago, is developing into one enormous construction site as it prepares to become home to a $10bn (£7.6bn) state-of-the-art flat-panel display factory for Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics company best known for making Apple iPhones in China.President Trump was present for the groundbreaking on 28 June, and the plant is due to be completed in 2019. Already there is so much orange along this corridor of the I-94 it looks like an particularly dour installation by the environmental artist Christo.The Foxconn deal, the biggest tech-firm tax break of the Trump presidency so far, was announced at an all-star press conference at the White House last year where Donald Trump was joined by Wisconsin’s governor, Scott Walker Foxconn’s chairman, Terry Gou and House speaker Paul Ryan.Trump, characteristically, took all the credit. “Everybody wanted Foxconn,” he said. “Frankly, they weren’t going to come to this country. I hate to say it, if I didn’t get elected, they wouldn’t be in this country. They would not have done this in this country. I think you know that very well.”But what probably sold Foxconn on Mount Pleasant were the massive tax breaks Wisconsin offered to seal the deal – breaks that could end up costing the state $4.8bn if the project hits all of its targets. It’s the latest giveaway in a series of corporate welfare cheques cut for highly profitable tech companies and the largest to a foreign firm ever in the US.So-called megadeals – defined by lobby group Good Jobs First as subsidies valued at $50m or more – are becoming increasingly common in the US as states line up to hand cash to big corporations, especially those in the sexy tech sector, in return for the promise of jobs. According to Good Jobs First, there were typically fewer than a dozen megadeals per year through 2007. Since 2008, that rate has more than doubled to an average of 25.The benefit of such deals to taxpayers, especially in an economy with low unemployment, is increasingly being questioned.In order to do so, Walker will have to make good on the promise that Foxconn will help create 13,000 new jobs in the region and transform an area still feeling the cold winds that followed the hollowing out of the US manufacturing industry.Foxconn itself has been more circumspect on the number of jobs it will create, saying in a press release it will “create 3,000 jobs with the potential to grow to 13,000 new jobs”. Even if 13,000 new jobs are created, Wisconsin would be paying $346,153 per job at a subsidy of $4.5bn. An astronomical sum, but nothing compared to the $1.5m per job cost if the deal ends up creating just 3,000 new positions.The math may seem off, but some – certainly not all – of Mount Pleasant’s residents are delighted.The scale of the Foxconn project is vast. Rural two-lane farm roads will become a six-lane road system with paths for bikes and pedestrians (you don’t see anyone walking here at present). A “smart corridor” is being constructed ready to take robot trucks when they finally become mainstream. The Foxconn site currently has one traffic stop when it’s finally finished, it will have 12. Approximately 42 miles (68km) of water pipes are being added, alongside 26 miles of gas pipes and 28 miles of telecom wires.“It’s like building a city,” says Brett Wallace, Foxconn project director at the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.When it’s finished the Foxconn campus will occupy approximately 22m square feet (2m sq metres) – more than twice the size of the Pentagon, the world’s largest office complex – making it by far the largest project in the state and one of the largest manufacturing campuses in the world.“Wisconsin is very good at making things,” says Dave DeGroot, Mount Pleasant’s village president. Sitting in the village hall, DeGroot and his team look like lottery winners who have yet to cash the cheque. DeGroot, a lifelong resident, is palpably excited about the changes that are coming.“Frankly, we went through generations of losing,” he says, hitting a Trumpian note. “For the longest time people have felt they had to leave here to get on with their lives. The best thing about this project is we are going to stop that brain drain.“After I graduated in 1980 we were in a recession. Most of my schoolmates booked out never to come back. Now they’d have something to stay for.“This isn’t just a manufacturing factory, it’s an economic system. It’s like nothing we have seen in this country before.”He sees a future where Foxconn suppliers and other tech firms are drawn to the area, turning the area into “Wisconsin Valley” – an answer to California’s tech dominance and a promise of a new, hi-tech future for the midwest.“This is exactly what Racine needed,” says John Crimmings, vice president of First Weber Realtors and a long-time area resident. “The midwest was hit very hard by the recession. A lot of people got hurt very badly. If there is a bubble this time, it’s about creating jobs. That seems more sustainable.“We are going to have rush hour and traffic jams. There is going to be a lot of change and you can’t make everybody happy.”He is right about that. Tempers are running high locally. DeGroot was forced to apologize after he refused to hear one objector at a meeting last year and said he would throw her “out on her can” if she kept speaking.Some residents face evictions as Foxconn takes their land. Walker and Scott Pruitt, the embattled head of Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency, have rolled back federal limits on lung-damaging smog pollution rules in the area and in nearby Illinois, a move that is likely to exacerbate air quality issues in a region already suffering from pollution-linked asthma attacks and heart disease.Conservation groups are furious that Foxconn has been granted access to 7m gallons of water per day from Lake Michigan, calling it an “unprecedented betrayal” of the Great Lakes Compact, a 2008 agreement that was intended to preserve the Great Lakes basin, repository of about one-fifth of the world’s fresh surface water.This region of the midwest has long been used to the tradeoff between jobs and environment. And the seismic change Foxconn promises is too good to miss, DeGroot says.But will locals benefit? Randy Bryce, the Democratic iron worker hoping to take retiring House speaker Paul Ryan’s Senate seat in the November midterm election, is sceptical. His office is a few miles from the plant in the industrially decayed county capital of Racine.“The people that are pushing this – Governor Walker and the Republicans – are the people who have made it almost impossible for the people of Wisconsin to benefit from it,” says Bryce.Under Walker, Wisconsin has moved aggressively to roll back labour protections and hiring rules meant to ensure vulnerable groups get jobs at the Foxconn plant.Nor are the jobs guaranteed. Foxconn made similar promises of huge job creation in Brazil and Pennsylvania that failed to come to pass.At the SC Johnson Integrated Manufacturing and Engineering Technology (iMet) Center in nearby Sturtevant, people are more positive. The college is gearing up for the recruitment drive of a lifetime. Staff are already being bombarded with calls from employers looking for graduates with the tech skills to tackle jobs in hi-tech industries.Over coffee at iMet, Jenny Trick, executive director of the Racine County Economic Development Corporation, trots out her very long to-do list. She is currently assessing local services, schools and medical facilities to see how they will cope with the influx of new people. “It’s a lot,” she says. “It’s like eating the proverbial elephant one bite at a time.” But she believes it will be worth it. Over 500 contractors turned up at the first jobs fair after the deal was announced. Foxconn’s arrival is creating an unprecedented buzz in the area.Trick expects the deal and what follows to be transformative for Racine’s tax base. Foxconn alone will spend $1.4bn a year in the area, she says. Restaurants, local contractors, shops – all will benefit. “If we all pull together this will be a huge success,” she says.But even after nine years of jobs growth, some people in Racine have been left behind. Ingrained poverty and the poor state of education have failed to help those at the bottom end of the ladder.In the state capital of Madison, Democratic congressman Mark Pocan is “greatly sceptical” of a “sketchy” deal that he believes will not ultimately benefit the local area, let alone the state of Wisconsin. “It’s a huge subsidy to give to any company, especially for a state the size of Wisconsin,” he says. “Most people in Wisconsin believe they are going to be paying for this for 25 years or more.“If you asked people how they would stimulate Wisconsin’s economy, I’m sure you would get a lot of ideas, but I don’t think that one of them would be, let’s give $4.5bn to a foreign company to create something in a corner of a state where a lot of people from outside the state will probably work.“We have some of the worst roads in the country, we have had huge cuts to education. I don’t think this matches most people’s priorities.”The state didn’t have the money to spend in the first place, says Pocan, and if it did he believes it would have been better off encouraging job growth at the grassroots level, spending on retraining people, developing small businesses and fixing infrastructure.Trump took Wisconsin in the last election by a narrow margin, promising jobs and prosperity. The Foxconn deal was proof of his promise. Now he and Walker face an uphill struggle to hold on to the state. Ryan has announced his retirement – a major boost to the campaign of left-leaning Democrat Bryce.Political as well as financial fortunes hang in the balance in Mount Pleasant. Walker has made promises in the past about job creation that he has failed to deliver. If Foxconn proves a dud, the deal could end his career, says Pocan.Time will tell. DeGroot and his team visited a Foxconn plant near Osaka, Japan, last year and were blown away by the sight of giant robots carrying 9ft by 10ft sheets of glass. That 10m sq ft plant plant will be dwarfed by Wisconsin’s. But for all its scale, can the plant in Wisconsin deliver on its promise of jobs? DeGroot is confident it can. “We’ve seen the future and it’s coming to Mount Pleasant,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caaa6e07eacc2c20d0b43614b09f05adbd412db4/0_68_4961_2976/master/4961.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=827a94400dca8d5fe7e93429ea153b61","title":"world cup female commentators alex scott eni aluko","story":"The football might have been brilliantly modern, fluid and exciting – but the conversation surrounding the television coverage of the World Cup has been stuck in the past. That both the BBC and ITV have chosen to have highly experienced ex-England internationals on their panels is par for the course. Yet the fact that two of them – the supremely talented Alex Scott and Eni Aluko – are women appears to have got people up in arms. Perhaps it’s because they are showing up the men with the level of detailed research they have obviously put in?I can’t quite believe we are still having this sort of discussion – it should be a complete non-topic. Jacqui Oatley has been a pioneer for female commentators and presenters for a number of years. I know her well, and remember the fierce backlash she received when she became the first female voice on Match of the Day. I recall thinking :“What’s the problem? Is she good at her job? Yes. Does she know what she is talking about? Absolutely. So what’s the big deal?”Yet the topic is now back on the agenda because two of my good friends and former teammates have been such a breath of fresh air. Eni and Alex have both been fantastic during this tournament. Not because they are my friends, not because they are female but because they are very good at what they do. The whole debate reminds me of when teams are looking for a new manager and people ask me who do I think it should be, a man or woman? My answer is simple: the best person for the job.Eni and Alex are informative, charismatic and know what they are talking about. I’ve seen how much they both prepare. They take their jobs seriously and that’s obvious to see. What more do you need? The minority of people that have had a problem with them – especially some journalists – are just envious that they haven’t been offered a prime spot for this World Cup. Some people just can’t take it when someone is getting something they are not. Social media can be amazing, but it also allows people to have a platform they wouldn’t usually have – and some absolutely ridiculous things have been said. Being on Twitter is like giving strangers your telephone number – you see it all, the good, the bad and the ugly. It would be nice if certain media outlets didn’t amplify that, and stopped giving these people a platform. What do we learn from an interview on national television with a person saying they don’t like the sound of a women’s voice on TV during football, and that it hurts their ears?Being a female in a predominantly male sport, I have had my fair share of criticism, but funnily enough it’s never about my footballing ability – it’s usually something else – whether it’s gender, race or sexuality. It’s not about people having to tread on eggshells or the “politically correct brigade” having a go. It’s my real life and it happens every day.I want every woman out there, whether at the World Cup or working in a supermarket, to know: “You are not alone, not all men are sexist, it’s just the ones that are threatened by you.” Let’s hope we can stop having these stupid conversations comparing men and women. Let’s hope that jobs always go to the best person for the job, whatever their gender. And let’s enjoy Eni and Alex, performing at the top of their game – because you can be sure there are people waiting for them to fail. To them I say: “They’re not going to fail – and they’re here to stay.”• Lianne Sanderson is a professional footballer who has played for Arsenal, New York Flash and England"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1824e5e443cb14a19b5a5a854f645e3db2f69e6/0_32_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f94eb2403ebda114ccf45b1f764be39","title":"oxford and cambridge could become the uks first true cycling cities","story":"Both cities are seeking ways to transport expanding populations without impacting their historic centres, yet the simplest solution is staring them in the faceSometimes politics really does overlook the obvious, and there’s a fine example just now in those two great centres of clear thinking and clogged traffic, Oxford and Cambridge. Here is the problem. The country wants, and badly needs, to build on these cities’ success in tech, bioscience and other industries: 129,000 new jobs and 135,000 new homes are planned in and around them over the next decade or so. But first you have to plan how to transport all the new people, and none of the usual answers works.Even if new roadbuilding were an answer in any city, it can’t be in these two. Their historic centres are inviolable, their electorates implacable. Gone, thank God, are the days when plans could be drawn up for a new highway through Christ Church Meadow. More buses? Both cities’ centres are already choked with them. s? Vastly expensive and disruptive, years to build, and couldn’t hope to serve most of the journeys people will need to make. Yet even as Oxford and Cambridge draw up plans for light rail, busways and rapid transit networks, one far simpler, cheaper and quicker answer is staring them in the face. It is something which already epitomises both places which, in Cambridge, already has a greater share of journeys than any other mode, and in Oxford not much less. It is, of course, the bicycle. In a report published today for the National Infrastructure Commission, I show how cycling can become the real rapid transit network in these cities, and how – with their small distances, historic centres and ever more dispersed employment sites – they are almost perfectly suited to it.With numbers like these, you might ask: can we really do more? Categorically yes – because those volumes have been achieved with, at least in Oxford’s case, almost no help from the authorities. One key central Oxford street is closed to bikes – while being open to buses. Oxfordshire council, the highway authority, does not have a single officer dedicated to cycling. Cambridge is better, but has relied largely on off-road or side-street routes, which are now reaching their limits. In both places, the main roads look little or no different to those of cities where nobody cycles. Designed almost entirely for cars, the streets of Oxford and Cambridge simply do not reflect how they are actually used. And in both places, most journeys from just outside the cities, though eminently cyclable, are still made by car, because the cycling alternatives are so awful. The problem is partly money. I recommend £200m for the necessary improvements. It’s a lot by cycling standards, but not by any other standards the government is already spending up to five times more on just one local road project near Cambridge.Mostly, however, it is about political will. Oxfordshire’s leader, Ian Hudspeth, impressed me as someone who genuinely wanted to do more – but the test will come in actions taken. Both cities need someone in the sort of role I held in London, and that Chris Boardman is doing in Manchester, to push things through.Cambridge’s plans, I think, focus too much on buses, which lack the flexibility of cycling, and on the metro – cited by some as a magic alternative to politically difficult subjects like congestion charging or roadspace reduction for motors, but in fact a chimera: not realistic or deliverable for somewhere of its relatively small size. Too often, politicians are seduced into single big, glamour projects, when lots of boring, smaller ones would help far more people at far less expense.Unlike building a metro under King’s College chapel, my recommendations are pretty simple, the mixture that has worked in London: segregated lanes on the main roads, better crossings of the ring-roads, congestion charging or some other kind of traffic reduction measures to make the roads safer where there is no room for separated lanes.It will be interesting to see whether anything happens. One Cambridge business leader said his city had too many members of what he called the “Triple-A club: against absolutely anything.” But even without the 135,000 new homes, the status quo is untenable – and cycling is the least disruptive way to create the capacity these cities need.Everything I recommend has already happened, years ago, in other countries. Given the head start which cycling has in Oxford and Cambridge, they are the perfect places to show how Britain, too, can make this kind of future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce1b46ad1d802673790dde190c665a5c6952fded/0_46_1935_1161/master/1935.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5589dc994ed8dfbfe98be942d860c2d","title":"botanical life in close up in pictures","story":"Colin Salter’s new book is a selection of extraordinary electron microscopic images of the plant world around us, including seeds, pollen, fruiting bodies, trees and leaves, flowers, vegetables and fruit"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fea99c03823c17d6d1eba5c238ac086f682b35ef/83_0_4333_2600/master/4333.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d96b9a5be14f1eb5a581bd0e7ff20e4","title":"gareth southgate england colombia world cup","story":"Booed by their own fans a year ago, England will face Colombia with public warmth rekindled – and a plan for penaltiesIt was Sunday afternoon, in a beachfront hotel in Repino, and Gareth Southgate was thinking back to the night England qualified for the World Cup and one of those jarring occasions at Wembley – of which there have been a few – that somehow still feel so relevant when charting the trajectory of his team.Southgate was reminiscing about a scratchy 1-0 win against Slovenia last October when the overriding memory was not Harry Kane’s late winner but the sour indifference of the crowd and the jarring sight of thousands of fans feeling it necessary to make their own entertainment – origami in this case. The paper planes that landed on the pitch felt like a symbol of the fans’ apathy. Jeers soon followed. “Bored spectators, paper planes and early exits – something is seriously wrong with this England team,” was one headline. And it was even worse, as Southgate could also remember, during England’s excursion to Malta the previous month when the opponents featured a centre-half from Ebbsfleet United and, for many of the travelling supporters, something snapped.The mass walkout around the 70-minute mark that night seemed like a choreographed protest. The chants of “We’re fucking shit” told their own story and what has never been reported until now is that England’s players were also targeted as they left the ground. Malta were 190th out of 211 teams in Fifa’s rankings and had won only five competitive matches in 55 years. Yet it was 0-0 at half-time and a late goal rush, when England scored three times, did not spare Southgate and his players on the journey away from the stadium. The chants informed them they were not fit to wear the shirt. It was spiteful, mutinous and the culmination, undoubtedly, of too many years of pent-up frustration.Ten months on the current side will be in Moscow on Tuesday to take on Colombia for a place in the quarter-finals of the World Cup and Southgate – the man who applied for several Championship jobs without even getting an interview only a few years ago – has held himself in such a way he is doubling up, apparently, as an unexpected leader of fashion, asked in one BBC interview whether he was aware how much waistcoat sales had rocketed back in England.“They’ve been able to change perceptions of how an England team might play,” Southgate said of his players. “We mustn’t lose sight of that. When we qualified, people were throwing paper aeroplanes on to the pitch at Wembley. We were driving back to our hotel in Malta with obscene chants being thrown at us from supporters.“I feel like we’ve started to connect the team with the public again. I feel like we’ve created excitement, that we’ve played in a style that has really shown what young English players are capable of, and I want us to continue doing that. I really believe in the group of players we’ve got. They are young. They are inexperienced. For some of them, this will be one of the biggest games they’ll have been involved in. But maybe not the biggest. We’ve always got to keep that context for the players.”His belief is that England cannot “consider ourselves a top team until we have beaten a top team” but he is encouraging them to think like one before they get the chance to stake that claim against players such as Radamel Falcao, Juan Cuadrado and, injury permitting, James Rodríguez. Ever since the start of this tournament one phrase has been heard more than any other within the England camp. It is to “attack the tournament”. Don’t hold back, don’t play with the restraint of other England teams. Don’t be the team of Euro 2016 and many others.Southgate played in an era for England when the team spirit was undermined by club cliques. Yet on Saturday, when given a day off, Jordan Henderson, Danny Welbeck, Marcus Rashford, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Jesse Lingard went together to the Divo Ostrov amusement park in St Petersburg. Or to put it another way, two players from Liverpool, two from Manchester United and one from Arsenal, all acting daft on a rollercoaster because they thought it was going to pull away before they had fixed their seatbelts. “You have to put club rivalries to one side,” Lingard said. “We have been like family. We all get along with each other and that’s why we have done so well. There is no squabbling. There are no cliques.”Back in training on Sunday Southgate was working on his 3-3-2-2 formation and, as is now the norm, his players finished with a mock penalty shootout that involved walking from the centre circle, one by one, to take aim from 12 yards. One potential problem is that Jamie Vardy and Rashford, two players who would happily take one, may not start the match. Jordan Pickford has saved three out of 25 penalties in senior football while Jack Butland has kept out four of the 25 he has faced (but none of the last 10) and Nick Pope, England’s third-choice goalkeeper, has the best statistics, with three saves out of 13.Pope is almost three inches taller than Pickford and it will be intriguing to find out whether Southgate would give any thought to bringing on the Burnley goalkeeper in those circumstances, providing England still had a substitute available. Southgate was unimpressed by Thibaut Courtois’ unflattering analysis of Pickford’s lack of inches after England’s 1-0 defeat by Belgium last week but it is true that a goalkeeper of considerable height and arm- can have a psychological advantage over opponents in a shootout.It is a tactic Martin O’Neill employed, for instance, in the 1996 play-off final for Leicester City against Crystal Palace. It was not needed, in the end, because of Steve Claridge’s last-minute winner, but O’Neill had taken off Kevin Poole shortly before to replace him with Leicester’s back-up goalkeeper, Zeljko Kalac, a 6ft 7in Australian who was known as “Spider” because of his long reach.“Six foot seven and useless,” as O’Neill described him. There is no inside information that Southgate is planning to do the same but, for all Pickford’s talents, Courtois’ comments have probably stung because they carry an element of truth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddab8e3e1ba5a0afe7bf30596ce0f0a505802e8e/304_0_2857_1714/master/2857.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5860b6dea1700402e43a47dfb1b51f86","title":"mohamed salah signs new liverpool contract jurgen klopp","story":"• Manager says deal ‘speaks very loudly’ of club’s ambition• Salah’s contract does not contain a release clauseLiverpool have secured Mohamed Salah on a new five-year contract that Jürgen Klopp believes provides further evidence of the progress being made at Anfield.The Egypt international has committed his future to Liverpool until 2023 in a lucrative deal that does not contain a release clause. Salah was widely coveted following a phenomenal debut season at Anfield that brought 44 goals in 52 appearances at club level and, as expected, has followed Roberto Firmino in committing to Klopp’s team for the long term. Sadio Mané is also in line for a new and improved contract at Liverpool.Salah’s form and global status has soared since he joined Liverpool on a five-year deal from Roma last summer. Negotiations on a new contract started with the 26-year-old’s agent, Ramy Abbas, before the end of a stunning debut season with Liverpool that brought a fourth-placed finish in the Premier League and a Champions League final appearance. Salah was forced out of the final defeat to Real Madrid with a shoulder injury but he returned to make two appearances for Egypt at the World Cup.No financial details have been announced about the forward’s new deal but he is expected to have doubled his wage to around £200,000 a week. The absence of a release clause ensures Liverpool are in a strong position should a rival suitor, such as Real Madrid, step up their interest in Salah in the future.Klopp, who was back at Melwood on Monday for the start of pre-season training, said: “I think this news can be seen for what it is: rewarding a person who performed and contributed greatly for the team and the club last season. It demonstrates two things very clearly also – his belief in Liverpool and our belief in him. We want world-class talent to see they have a home at Anfield where they can fulfil all their professional dreams and ambitions – we are working hard together to achieve this.“When someone like Mo Salah commits and says this place is my home now, it speaks very loudly, I think. Equally, our commitment to him says we see his value and want him to grow even more and get even better within our environment.“The key thing to remember is the best thing about Mo is that he never sees himself as being more important than the team or anyone else within it. He recognises his teammates and this club helped him achieve inidual success last season. He sees the inidual awards come because he is part of something bigger that is special. Mo reflects where we are as a team, I think. Last season was special with many special moments – but we want more. We want to be more successful and achieve more together – as the supporters sang so loudly: ‘We’re never gonna stop.’ This has to be the attitude inidually and collectively.”Salah will not be among the Liverpool players reporting for pre-season training on Monday. He has been given an extended break following Egypt’s World Cup campaign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031cb881764b755120b7348fda98d1c630d2cf58/1212_593_2705_1623/master/2705.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a726315522ab1487d6f0aaffcc12c66","title":"ngolo kante class world cup france","story":"The diminutive France midfielder eschews glitz on and off the pitch but helps bring teams to their knees with artful simplicityHenri Langlois would have understood the genius of N’Golo Kanté. Over 60 years ago the founder of the Cinémathèque Française revived interest in the career of an obscure American actress of the silent era with a famous quote: “There is no Garbo! There is no Dietrich! There is only Louise Brooks!”It was hyperbole, of course. There were lots of other worthwhile things in cinema, just as there are other things in football besides a 5ft 6in midfielder born 27 years ago in a Paris suburb. But more than ever after last Saturday, it is tempting to feel that way about the player in France’s No 13 shirt. There is no Ronaldo! There is no Messi! There is only N’Golo Kanté!There are qualities about Kanté that speak with a rare\u0026nbspclarity of the game at its best and purest, of how humility, altruism, diligence and devotion to the collective cause can survive and prosper even amid the hyperinflated circus of modern sport.Something else that Langlois said about Brooks could equally apply, with a few words changed to suit subject and context, to the man who won England’s three major player-of-the-year awards in 2017: “He is the intelligence of the footballing process, the perfect incarnation of all that is football, with complete naturalness and complete simplicity. His art is so pure that it becomes invisible.”Kanté’s role in France’s resplendent fourth goal on Saturday, the one that broke Argentinian hearts on surely one of the most enthralling days in the history of the World Cup, was typical in its near-invisibility. With the ball at Hugo Lloris’s feet, he made himself available just beyond the edge of the penalty area. Taking possession, he made a couple of steps before releasing the ball to Antoine Griezmann, who was dropping off close to the centre spot. It looked like nothing special, but it was. As always with Kanté, the seemingly straightforward pass was delivered with a pace, a weight and an angle that helped the receiver to decide his next move. From Griezmann the ball flowed swiftly via Blaise Matuidi and Olivier Giroud to the scorer, Kylian Mbappé.This aspect of Kanté’s skill – this fundamental relevance – is reminiscent of the great Claude Makelele, his predecessor in the blue of Chelsea and France. But Kanté covers more ground at higher speed and is sharper in the interception. On Saturday, with the stakes at their highest, he kept Lionel Messi as quiet as anyone ever will.There is also a greater range to his game, something which his ego-free attitude permits him to reveal only sparingly. Five minutes after that fourth goal he dispossessed Ángel Di María deep in his own half, quickly weighed up the situation, and decided that for once the best option was not an instant pass but a 50-metre solo sprint with the ball. When the moment was right, he produced a caviar-laden pass from which Mbappé ought to have completed his hat-trick.And yet Kanté seems to have nothing to do with the world created by social media. He has no profile, no brand. Although no one could be more committed to the idea of victory and the team, he takes no prominent role in displays of extreme emotion. He is usually on the fringes when a goal is celebrated. He refrains from arguing with officials. (On Saturday he seemed briefly on the brink of making a complaint about something, but thought better of it.)The intrinsic worth of such a player has nothing to do with the values of the market. Probably only his colleagues appreciate how much he brings. As Zinedine Zidane said in 2003, commenting on Real Madrid’s decision to sell Makelele in order to buy David Beckham: “Why put another layer of gold paint on the Bentley when you’re losing the entire engine?”Maybe it’s a sign of how far English football has progressed that Kanté is so warmly and widely appreciated. We can be proud that he has flourished in the Premier League, emulating his compatriot Eric Cantona’s feat of winning the title in consecutive seasons with different clubs. What is hard to understand is why, given the opportunity to study the likes of Makelele, Javier Mascherano and Kanté at close quarters, the men who run the FA technical centre at St George’s Park have not set up a special department devoted to helping young English players acquire and refine their priceless attributes.From the response to the weekend’s\u0026nbspmatches in Russia, of course, it would appear that, following\u0026nbspthe departures of Ronaldo and Messi, there is only Mbappé, the 19-year-old who possesses a rare attribute described to me 20 years ago\u0026nbspby Gérard Houllier, a former France manager, when discussing another of his nation’s prodigies at the same age: “You can be fast without the ball or, like Nicolas Anelka, fast with the ball.”In the same conversation Houllier tipped Anelka as a future winner of the Ballon d’Or. That didn’t happen, and Mbappé’s predecessor – another son of the Parisian banlieues – had a troubled relationship with the World Cup. Left out in 1998, 2002 and 2006, he was sent home early from South Africa in 2010 after an altercation with the head coach, Raymond Domenech.Maybe the comparatively placid Mbappé is destined to become the central figure of this World Cup, just as the\u0026nbsporiginal Ronaldo, another player he resembles, was when Brazil recaptured the trophy in 2002. But if he does, he won’t have achieved it without the platform provided by a player who inspires deeper feelings than even the most spectacular solo goal can evoke. For those who cherish the game’s more profound characteristics, N’Golo Kanté is football."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b02fa2de3f58b2f723fca85fc469e390e9b3416/0_245_4143_2486/master/4143.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=748f36023a279ec5d8f02bd68f4fcafc","title":"now we can forget turkey modric and croatia lay ghost of 2008 to rest","story":"Luka Modric’s mind went back to Euro 2008. Everybody’s in Croatia did. The midfielder had blown a 117th-minute penalty to win Sunday night’s World Cup last-16 tie for his country against Denmark and all he could think about was Turkey.It was the defeat that scarred a generation of Croatian footballers and fans. They had faced Turkey in the quarter-final of the European Championship – it was then the first knockout round – and, when Ivan Klasnic put them 1-0 up in the last minute of extra-time, the victory appeared to be theirs.It had been a dire game, with chances at a premium but, incredibly, Turkey’s Semih Şentürk found an equaliser in the 122nd minute. Croatia were crushed and they would lose the penalty shootout. Modric missed his kick. So did Ivan Rakitic.The parallels with the Denmark game were vivid. In 2008 Croatia had breezed through the group phase, winning each of their three ties, including a 2-1 victory over Germany. They had played some lovely stuff. But against Turkey, they hit the wall. Their cohesion evaporated, together with their spirit of adventure.Here in Russia, Croatia won all three group games, including a 3-0 thumping of Argentina. Their football was slick, incisive and ruthless. But the Denmark match brought another freeze. What was going on?There is a further strand to the tale. At Euro 2016 Croatia had taken seven points from an available nine to advance as group winners. They beat Spain 2-1 in the final group match. But against Portugal in the last 16 they did not play. A dismal game was locked at 0-0 in extra time and headed for penalties when Ricardo Quaresma conjured a 117th-minute winner for Portugal.Since the 1998 World Cup, when Croatia famously reached the semi-final, they had not won a knockout tie at a World Cup or European Championship, an extraordinary statistic given the talent that has been in their ranks. Before Sunday they had not even appeared in another World Cup knockout game and so when Modric saw his weak penalty saved by the Denmark goalkeeper, Kasper Schmeichel, the demons circled and shrieked.It is almost impossible to imagine the pressure on the players in the shootout, although the Denmark manager, Åge Hareide, offered some insight. “Research has proven during penalty shootouts that your adrenaline and stress levels are as high as when you are in a war zone,” he said.Modric stepped up to take Croatia’s third penalty, his team trailing 2-1. This time his kick was even softer. He placed it with little conviction down the middle and how his heart must have jumped when Schmeichel, who moved to the left, struck out a trailing leg in an attempt to save. But the ball went in.Modric had won the most intense of personal battles and his team would do likewise. When Croatia’s goalkeeper, Danijel Subasic, made his third save of the shootout, the scene was set for Rakitic to win it. In another redemption story, a further piece of symmetry, he found the net. Croatia exploded in relief.“The victory says a lot about our spirit,” Modric said. “I said before the game that since 2008 we had never passed the first knockout game and it was very important for us to take the monkey off our back. And we did it. It was not easy because the Turkey game was still in our minds. I think it was in everyone’s minds because it was so tough for us, that defeat.“With me missing a penalty in the last few minutes, we needed to have big character and team spirit and everything to stay calm and focused and win the game. With this, I think we can now forget about Turkey. Will it change the mentality? I hope so.”It should be noted that Modric, after his penalty miss, continued to demand the ball he did not run or hide. And there was never any question over whether he would take a kick in the shootout.A monkey off their backs? This was a whole troop of them. The hope is that Croatia, arguably been the team of the tournament during the group phase, can rediscover their freedom. Modric has rarely looked so happy after a game and he was all smiles as he spoke to reporters in the mixed zone. Next up for Croatia is a quarter-final against Russia on Saturday.“From the first game of this World Cup, we have showed character and mentality,” Modric said. “And we showed it again against Denmark. This team has character, that is without doubt. But now we need to continue. This team can do much more. Hopefully, we will do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87ba8e2aaecea9f03d254da9bd5824484afab342/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS90d2l0dGVyX2RlZmF1bHQucG5n\u0026amp;s=262f89a3ba843e5312b45b6d901720ad","title":"watch the world cup last 10 minutes christian sinibaldi","story":"Photographer Christian Sinibaldi captures the joy and despair in British living rooms, as fans from Iceland to Iran, Serbia to South Korea, support their teams. Interviews by Erica Buist and Deborah LintonPhotographer Christian Sinibaldi captures the joy and despair in British living rooms, as fans from Iceland to Iran, Serbia to South Korea, support their teams. Interviews by Erica Buist and Deborah LintonWhen Christian Sinibaldi turned up at homes across England to photograph fans watching the World Cup, he was overwhelmed by every nationality’s hospitality. “And their food,” he says. “I’ve eaten a lot of crisps and beer, but also the traditional Brazilian dish of feijoada in north London, Mexican quesadillas and guacamole in Putney, and a lovely Moroccan tagine cooked on the barbecue in Letchworth.”Sinibaldi sat with a fixed camera near the television screen and never asked anyone to pose: he didn’t need to. “Pretty much as soon as the match got under way, they forgot I was there.” He enjoyed watching the tension build. “Very few people left the room or changed positions throughout the game. They were glued to their chairs.”It does mean that Sinibaldi has not watched any matches himself, because he has been looking the wrong way. “But I could nearly always tell when a goal was coming – I could see it in their faces.” There’s a reason he made time for the project this year: as an Italian, it’s one way of dealing with the fact his home side didn’t make the cut.Timing is everything at Rick and Jo Cooper’s house, where the family are on countdown for England’s second match of the tournament, against Panama. With excited shouts of “Half an hour to kick-off” drifting in from the garden, the smell of burgers on the barbecue waft into the front room where the floor is strewn with balloons, inflatable clappers and St George’s flags.The country is in the early grips of a heatwave and little do the Coopers – grandmother Alison, 72, uncle Malc, 44, Rick and wife Jo, both 41, and their sons, Leo, eight, and Aaron, five – know that the sunshine will not be the only turn-up for England.Stones’ header puts England 1-0 up eight minutes in. “I missed it!” says Rick, distracted by Aaron walking in with lunch. But no one misses goals two, three, four or five – including two Harry Kane penalties – all before half-time. “This is unbelievable!” Rick shouts. “Football’s coming home.” The noise from the boys’ vuvuzelas is deafening. “The boys were too little for Brazil 2014,” says Rick, a Manchester United season ticket holder, “so I’m enjoying watching this one with them. I was obsessed with skiing as a kid. But France 98, where Beckham got sent off, that really got me into football and I’m mad for it now.”His brother Malc says, “You always have that hope with England, and it’s always been dashed. I remember Gazza with the tears at Italia 90, watching that with my late dad. And Maradona’s hand of God in 86, watching that on holiday in Torquay, around a tiny black-and-white TV. The injustice of it. But we’re perennial optimists, and with this young team, there’s a different mentality.”Their mother, Alison, is the only one who saw England triumph in 66. She says, “The country couldn’t believe it. My late husband, Henry, he loved the game. He always said: ‘If they play football, they’ll murder ’em.’ He’d have been thrilled with this one.”Kiki Machado and friends, Crouch End, London, 17 JuneCristina “Kiki” Machado’s house is a sight, and sound, to behold during the Brazil v Switzerland game, what with the yells of the 30 people squeezed into the living room, the guitar music from Kiki’s tenant Caco Barros (at front, glass in hand) and the green-and-yellow stars chalked on the pavement outside. “We drew six,” says Kiki (in hat), “because Brazil has won five times – we drew one more for luck.”Kiki’s living room is packed out with her “north London family”, friends collected over 20 years in this country, from Brazil, England, Lithuania, Serbia and Italy. When she arrived, her godmother gave her the number of her best friend’s daughter, Luciana, who was living in London. She never called, but seven years later they met by chance in the local library at a singalong for their children.“My family in Brazil said people aren’t celebrating there the way we are,” Kiki says. “It’s natural when you’re away from your country to find your people and cheer together.” She remembers as a child how everything stopped during a World Cup game, so when Martha asked if she could come home from school early for the match, she said, “Of course. Your teacher will understand.”After their 7-1 defeat by Germany in 2014, Brazilians are approaching this World Cup with trepidation. “I’m in defence mode,” says Janaína Campoy, 44 (on right, wearing glasses). “That game was a tragedy. It came just as things were going badly for us politically and economically. We lost confidence as a nation.”The self-esteem of an entire country seems a lot to put on 11 men, but they don’t let them down. After the match, they party until midnight, because that’s the Brazilian way to celebrate a draw. “When we won in 2002, that party lasted 24 hours,” Kiki says. “The hangover lasted a week.”Adama Kande and friends, Ancoats, Manchester, 24 JuneThe music and the chat don’t stop at Adama Kande’s city centre flat. Adama, 44 (in front of picture), a musician, came to the UK from south Senegal in 2008 and the green, red and yellow of his home country is all around his living room: on flags, posters and djembe drums.Watching with his partner Neilum Singh, 43 (second from right), and friends Iain Dixon (far right), 40, and Lamin Conteh, 42 (far left), Adama cannot hide his excitement. “Senegal is like Brazil,” he says. “Everyone plays football. When I was a boy, my neighbour was manager of the local team. He taught me, too – I’m a good player.”An early goal from Senegal superstar Sadio Mané sends them wild: the music and chants get louder, and the energy soars. When Japan equalise, Lamin booms: “It’s game on. Game on.” But when Japan equalise a second time, the mood deflates.“I wanted more,” Adama admits at full time. “They got the opportunity to win, but there were a few mistakes. They need to change tactics now.”For him, the World Cup couldn’t get much sweeter than 2002, when Senegal beat title holders France in the first game and reached the quarter-finals. He watched back home, crowded around a neighbour’s TV. “When Papa (Bouba Diop) pushed that ball inside, it felt as if we could beat anybody.”Neilum agrees: “They love their sport in Senegal. Because people have limited access to technology, they’re forced to share a TV, sometimes outside, sometimes in a cinema. Watching football with West Africans is electric – it’s just fire.”Before most Morocco matches, Mohammed Essakhi, 54 (in cap), finds himself in the kitchen cooking nibbles for friends coming over. He’s a school head chef and caterer, focusing on Moroccan and Spanish food. For this game, his starters include hummus, tzatziki and stuffed peppers. The barbecue comes after, “because when there’s a football match on, we want to watch it”.Balbair Chahal, 42 (pictured front left), works with Mohammed at the school Phil Moore, 56, and Amanda Brosnan, 50 (centre), are friends and fellow Leicester City supporters. They watch the game with Mohammed’s wife, Rosalind, 56, his nephew, Kaeran Duff, 30, his son, Nizar, 16, who is training with Watford and hopes to go pro, and his daughter, Azza, 22 (far right).The 1-0 loss to Iran is “a bit of a let-down”, because the team played well, says Mohammed. Azza points to an important difference: “Footballers in England are so famous – it’s good to see people from your own background compete on the same platform.”“I would love Morocco to win,” Mohammed says, “but realistically, it’s not going to happen. What would really make me proud is seeing Morocco host the World Cup. We’ve been asking for about 20 years.” His best football memory is the 3-1 victory against Portugal in 1986: “I was still living in Casablanca, and I remember youngsters celebrating in the street. Nobody thought it would be possible. At that time, Africa had only two teams that had qualified.”Naohiko Nishi (on right) and his eight-year-old son Atsuhiko (next to him) have no special food or drink, hang no flags, have no good-luck rituals. What they do have is a Japanese guidebook to the World Cup, with detailed information about every player: how old they are, what kind of a player. This is consulted very regularly.Today the Nishis – Naohiko and his wife Akiko (far right), their sons Atsuhiko, eight, and Takahiko, six (front right) – are watching the game with their friends Hiro and Shiho (on left), and their children Masa, 12 (on floor), and Iroha, nine (with giraffe). The children are keen footballers: Masa, Atsuhiko and Takahiko all play at the nearby Football Samurai Academy. Atsuhiko plays football three days a week, and says he hopes to play for Japan when he’s older. For him, the best moment of this game is Shinji Kagawa’s penalty, secured in the game’s sixth minute after a handball from Carlos Sánchez: “It was kind of scary before he took it – we were very surprised that we won.”His father agrees: manager Akira Nishino was appointed just two months before the World Cup began. “To be honest, Colombia is much better than Japan. They got a red card, which was so lucky for us. Winning this match was a great moment - because in the 2014 World Cup, Japan didn’t get a good result.” Though they were the first team to qualify, Japan failed to make it out of the group stages.For Naohiko, the joy of this competition has been watching Japan improve their standing on the world stage. “Japan didn’t join the World Cup until 1998. Only some of them played in Europe at the time - whereas now almost all the Japanese players play for Europe. The quality has got much better and their confidence has increased.”The win against Colombia, and a subsequent draw against Senegal, will be hard to beat, though Naohiko still holds dear his memories of the 2002 World Cup, held in South Korea and Japan: he was able to attend the opening game - where he watched Japan draw against a “very strong” Belgium.Shirin Azari and friends, Bromley, 20 JuneIf only Vahid Amiri, the Iranian striker, could hear the chant from the mothers, teachers and former students of Iyda, or the Intercultural Youth Development Association, a Farsi-speaking community in south London: “Vahid pa Talayii omide team e mayii (Goldenfoot Vahid, you are our team’s hope).” Sadly, his golden foot doesn’t save the day: Iran’s only goal in the game against Spain is offside and they lose 1-0.It is a women-only party, organised by Shirin Azari (behind sofa, in white Iran T-shirt) with friends in Bromley. “We often get together for food and gossip and chat,” says her friend Pupak Navabpour, whose children learn Farsi at Iyda. Food is the focus at these events, and it is all set up before people arrived, “so you can eat with your eyes first”.Shirin has made dolmas and Turkish burek, and serves them with rosebud and cardamom black tea brewed in a samovar, followed by gaz (almond nougat) and nabat (crystal sugar) on sticks. “That is what we do when ladies get together,” she says. “The group was singing Iran Iran by Arash, dancing and chanting in Farsi.”“I think Iran are really good at defence, one of the best,” says Shirin, “but not attack. Even if they try to score, there’s nobody there they keep themselves to their own goal.” Despite her criticisms, she is proud of her team, “because they don’t have the facilities or coaches that western countries have.”Pupak agrees: “It was gutting that the goal was disallowed. They defended well and almost scored a few times – even though they lost, I think they did quite well.”Pupak started taking Farsi classes as an adult when she realised she was beginning to struggle with her mother tongue. Now her children go every Saturday. “My youngest said, ‘But Mummy, I’m English.’ Even though I’ve spent most of my life here, I don’t feel that kind of belonging. When I watch Iran play in the World Cup, I suddenly feel that connection to home.”On 17 June, Serbia won their first World Cup game in eight years. The more superstitious might have the Bogdanovics to thank for it: “We sit in the order we were sitting in 2010, when Serbia won against Germany,” says Deanna, 47 (on left). “We try to recreate exactly what happened that day, so we can win in the future.” Serbian snacks must be on the table and everyone must dress for the occasion.Deanna and Brian, 47, moved to London 20 years ago soon they will have spent more of their lives here than in Serbia. “Often you question where home really is,” Deanna says, “but the World Cup erases that feeling. I’m not usually into football, but the World Cup turns me into a completely different person. When we scored,” she says of the winning goal, “it was such an amazing feeling. I don’t think we breathed for the last 10 minutes.”The only year-round football fan in the family is 15-year-old Vuk. Serbia haven’t qualified for the World Cup for more than half his lifetime, and he remembers being a small boy watching Serbia beat Germany. “Back then, Stojkovic was my favourite goalkeeper, and he saved a penalty. That was a proud moment.” His ritual during the game is never to jinx it by being overconfident: “Even if we were 3-0 up, I’d still keep my mouth shut until the final whistle.” Silla Johannesdottir and friends, London, 22 JuneIceland’s mere presence here is historic. The smallest nation ever to qualify for the World Cup, its population is the same as Sunderland’s. Silla Johannesdottir (on far right), who watches the game with her family and Icelandic friends, bearing flags and face paint, says, “It’s like a fairytale – we’re a tiny, tiny country. No matter how it goes, we’re so super proud of them.”But the game is disappointing, ending in a 2-0 loss to Nigeria. “When we got the penalty, there was a tiny bit of hope,” Silla says, “but Gylfi Sigurdsson didn’t score. That was a real low point, a kick in the gut. Everyone just left, there was no celebration. It was a bit sad.”What went wrong? “They were just better than us. They can run, those boys, and the Icelandic team just couldn’t keep up with that pace.”Her husband, Dadi Sveinbjarnarson (back right), agrees that speed was the Nigerian team’s strength. “The Icelandic team played pretty well, they had two or three tries on goal, and that was more than Nigeria, as far as I could see. Iceland just got outrun.”Dadi feels particularly connected to the team because he used to work with Iceland goalkeeper Hannes Thór Halldórsson, whom he describes as “a Viking shield wall”. “I was a commercial producer and he was one of our film directors. He is a very talented commercials maker who had a side life as an athlete – then that became the more important part of his career.” Halldorsson even directed a Coca-Cola commercial for the World Cup, using the famous supporters’ “Viking clap” as a lead-in.But Silla thinks everyone in Iceland feels connected to the team, and that even other nations have been rooting for them. “People approach us and say, ‘Well done.’ Everyone is happy for us. The World Cup really brings people together.”Erik Sarmiento and friends, Manchester, 24 JuneIn Colombia, football isn’t watched with strangers in a bar – it is a party to be shared with those closest to you, in your home. So Erik Sarmiento, 27 (sitting on the floor), is bringing South American carnival to inner-city Manchester by cramming 10 friends and family into his small flat to watch Colombia play Poland. The beers are flowing and a Colombian barbecue is on the go, with sides of guacamole, black beans, chimichurri and patacones (fried plantain) served with hogao (tomato salsa).The Spanish TV commentary is streamed at high volume and everyone’s focus on the match is unwavering, despite the noise of friends talking. An expensive bottle of Amarone wine sits by the television for final whistle celebrations.Erik, a business manager who lives with his wife Laura Van Hoof, 28, a Spanish teacher, came to the UK as a university student on a scholarship to learn English in 2009.“Growing up in Colombia,” he says, “sport isn’t associated with status or money because you can play in the streets. Colombia turns into a carnival when the national team plays. When I watch here, with Colombian food, music, friends, it’s a little bit of home in the UK.”The group play on bongo drums and improvise beats with a cheese grater, metal jug and spoons throughout the game. For 90 minutes, it feels as if the room is poised to explode – and it does, when Mina scores 40minutes in. “Goooooooooooal-azo,” they scream. By the third goal, they hug and sing: “Championes, championes, olé, olé, olé!”Erik says, “Football is an international language. I play four or five times a week – it’s how I met these friends. I saw someone wearing a Colombian club’s kit and now we are all watching together.”“The last World Cup was the first time in our history that we made it to the quarter-finals James Rodríguez was top goalscorer and won the golden boot which was a big thing for us. Now our expectations are high.”Yves Ogrodzki and friends, Cheltenham, 21 JuneStudies over the years have reported that the French aren’t the easiest folks to please. Chef Yves Ogrodzki, 53 (with glass in hand), and his sous chef Jeremy Denni, 21, aren’t doing much to subvert those findings with their assessment of France’s victory over Peru. “It was a bit weak,” Yves says, “they could have done a lot better than that. I didn’t find it very exciting really.” Jeremy agrees, pointing out, “We have some of the best players in the world, so 1-0 is falling short. There were moments I was scared we wouldn’t win.”Yves and his wife Elisabeth, 53 (on right), run a French restaurant in Cheltenham, and they have invited the staff to their home to watch the game. “We want to bring to our customers a proper French atmosphere, so all our staff come from France. They are all in their 20s, it’s their first time working abroad, so we very often organise little parties like this at home.”Yves prefers rugby to football, but finds the World Cup gives foreigners an opportunity to talk about their national identity. “I remember when France won in 1998, people felt very patriotic. But living abroad, there’s a new dimension to our identity. The World Cup brings everybody together while still having that thing that says, ‘I belong to that country.’ Even someone like me who is more interested in other sports, we still get to go back to our roots. And I like the jokes. I’ve seen people joking on social media that now Italy haven’t qualified, they can look after everyone else by delivering pizzas.”There’s no special World Cup dish, just your basic French delights: a glass of pastis, sausages with mustard from Dijon, some traditional Parisian baguettes with ham and cornichons. “To bring luck,” Jeremy says, “we all sing the Marseillaise, the French national anthem, before the game starts.”At the apex of a isive Mexican general election, nothing brings the country together like beating Germany. Yves Hayaux-du-Tilly (back right) watched the game with his sister and her Irish husband, his daughters, the nanny Maggie who has lived with them for 16 years, his sons and their friends. His wife, who was working, was sad not to see their win.“It was a brilliant game,” Yves says. “Mexico generally make it to the finals, but they normally underperform. This time they played brilliantly it wasn’t a consequence of a mistake from the German defence. We could have scored one or two goals in the second half unfortunately we didn’t, but we won. We defeated the world champions.”The family members have varying levels of superstition when it comes to the World Cup. José Pablo, 19, “will probably wear the same underpants and shirt without cleaning it every game the Mexican team plays”. They have to hang the Mexican flag and the beer has to be Mexican: “And of course we have guacamole, nachos, quesadillas – as an expat, it’s a way to connect with your country.”After the victory, Yves was in Mexico and found the mood of the entire nation lifted. “I was there three weeks before the game and everybody was angry and trying to convince other people to vote for their candidate. Now, nobody really cares about the election. We feel nothing can be that wrong if we can beat Germany. It changes the mood of the entire country. It’s very, very powerful.”Yves, whose best football memory is watching Mexico play at the Azteca stadium during the 1986 World Cup, thinks people will be talking about this victory for decades to come. “I love that the World Cup gives us this opportunity every four years to try again. That’s what life is about: you always have the opportunity to prove yourself one more time.”Ten days later, Mexico got through to the final 16, despite losing 3-0 to Sweden in their final group match. “It was a bittersweet feeling,” Yves says. “I was a little bit disappointed by the lack of character, focus, concentration and discipline in the players. But the main objective is to get through to what we call in Mexico ‘the fifth game’,” ie the quarter-finals. “That has only happened twice, only at the World Cups in Mexico,” he says. Yves did ultimately enjoy watching the Sweden match in a pub, largely because of the simultaneous Germany v South Korea game, which saw reigning champions Germany crash out of the tournament. “We didn’t care about our score,” he says. “We were all watching South Korea and when they scored we all cheered and hugged the South Korean fans.”Lee Jaeyoung and friends, Bradford, 23 JuneNo one gathered in front of Lee Jaeyoung’s TV thinks South Korea have a chance against Mexico. The group of international students are on a study abroad programme at Bradford University. “I asked my friends how they thought we would do,” says Jaeyoung, 27 (back left), who studies psychology, “and they predicted a 2-0 loss, or maybe 2-1 if we were lucky.” He is more optimistic, hoping for a draw, but in the end the 2-1 defeat comes as no surprise. “I saw Mexico play Germany, and the Mexican team is really good.”Before his friends arrived, Jaeyoung bought some beer and fried a load of chicken drumsticks – an extremely popular combination the Koreans call “chi-maek”, from “chi” for chicken and “maekju”, the Korean word for beer. “Unfortunately we couldn’t find Korean beer,” Jaeyoung says, “so we had Stella and someone brought Carlsberg. It was a really good time.” They hung up the Korean flag for luck.“I don’t watch football usually, just the World Cup,” says Kim Seungyeon, 21 (back right), who studies psychology and counselling. “It’s a lot like the Olympics in that if our team wins, I feel I’ve won, too. I know they work hard, so I’m really happy to support them.” For her, the moment to beat in World Cup history came in 2002, when hosts South Korea reached the semi-finals. “It was the best moment – a miracle.”Despite today’s loss, they are extremely proud of the team’s forward, Son Heung-min. “He got a really incredible goal during extra time,” says Jaeyoung, who is a huge fan of the Tottenham player. “After the match finished, I saw on the Korean news that he was crying in the locker room. I felt like shouting, ‘Don’t cry, Son! We lost but you were the best!’”He was similarly impressed with his team four days later, when they achieved the unexpected and won 2-0 against Germany, marking the end of the latter team’s World Cup. “I didn’t expect that kind of score,” he says. “It was really impressive.” The match was a 0-0 draw until the 92nd minute, which would have still resulted in Germany being knocked out, but then South Korea’s Kim Young-gwon scored: “And I was like, ‘What the hell? This is awesome,’” Jaeyoung says. The goal was ruled offside, then reviewed on VAR, allowed, and was swiftly followed by a second goal from South Korea. Even though the win didn’t change their knockout from the World Cup, the celebrations were exuberant. “We were screaming and dancing,” Jaeyoung says . “I just wish I had put a bet on.”Anastasiia Fedorova and friends, Catford, London, 19 JuneThe balloon is for Anastasiia Fedorova’s husband, whose birthday was a few weeks before the match. He chose to work an extra hour in order to miss the game. “He was absent on principle,” she explains. “He’s British but was born in Ukraine, so he doesn’t support the Russian team. Sometimes we have small political battles. If there was a game between Russia and Ukraine, it would be a nightmare.”Anastasiia, 31 (on right), and Polina Kaplitskaia, 29, studied at the same university, St Petersburg State in Russia, and four years later bumped into each other on a plane from London to Moscow and rekindled their friendship. They both came to the UK for love Anastasiia’s husband is British, and Polina’s husband Andrey had been living in the UK for 10 years when he met Polina through a mutual friend on a trip to Saint Petersburg.Polina has brought along red, white and blue paints to decorate their faces with the Russian flag. She thinks Egypt’s own goal, clumsily scored by Ahmed Fathi in the 47th minute, prompted a surge of energy on the Russian side: “I don’t think our team was concentrating very hard - but then Egypt scored an own goal and after that Russia started playing better. They became more active and confident.”“Our first goal was the best moment for me,” Anastasiia says. “I remember thinking, we’re so close to winning the game, and if we win we’ll go through to the next stage and it will be the first time in Russian history.” She hopes the World Cup will be good for the Russian people: “I hope everyone sees the real Russia, how the people are nice and welcoming. Sometimes our government does things that aren’t nice, but the people are not the same as the government. My parents in Russia say the atmosphere is so warm.”Living abroad when your country is hosting sometimes means missing out on the party, and Anastasiia felt sad when she saw Instagram stories showing people celebrating in the streets of St Petersburg. “We won and that was a surprise for everyone,” she says. “We’ve only won two games so far – but for us it’s like we’ve won the whole thing.”• This article was amended on 2 July 2018 to correct the spelling of Adama Kande’s surname.• Commenting on this piece?

Richard Williams clears his throat and sings his praise for France’s unsung hero N’Golo Kanté, who eschews glitz on and off the pitch but helps bring teams to their knees with artful simplicity. Mexico’s record against Brazil in recent games isn’t brilliant, they’ve lost three drawn one and won one of their last five matches. But that doesn’t include the Olympic final in 2012, featuring a fair few of the players in both squads for today’s match, took part in an thralling game at Wembley. Mexico won 2-1 and claimed the gold medal, leaving Neymar heartbroken. And going further back, to 2007, when the teams last met in a competitive match, Mexico beat Brazil 2-0 in the Copa America. So there is some hope to be found for Mexico fans this afternoon.

See if you can do any better. On the subject of talented Brazilian footballers, David Seare writes: “I can’t ever escape the feeling that Neymar is a bit of a sideshow. He seems like a footballer built for YouTube highlight reels. He had success at Barcelona alongside Messi and Suarez without really being the main man. His efforts in Paris are, well, in Paris. Brazil have thrived because of Coutinho while Neymar has changed hair-dos, complained a lot and cried a bit. Do you think he’ll stand up and be counted or continue to irritate as much as fascinate?” I think his performance for Barcelona against PSG in that bonkers Champions League game in 2017 was evidence that he is more than capable of grabbing a game by the scruff of the neck and bending it to his will as only truly great players can. But his move to PSG has hindered his progress and until he leaves them I think he will struggle to develop to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo’s level. Not that he is far off. Paolo spoke on the podcast last night about how Tite may prefer to play Gabriel Jesus instead of Roberto Firmino because the Liverpool player often drifts into Neymar’s space. If this is true this kind of protective pampering of Neymar is a little worrying and might harm the team. There has always been inidualism in football but it seems that the international manager’s authority over celebrity players has never been weaker than it is right now. If, like me, you’ve struggled to explain to your young children exactly why some footballers – often Brazilian ones – are better than others at this World Cup, then this video produced by sometime  scribes, Alex Bellos and Ben Lyttleton, might be very helpful. It is designed to promote the book series Football School to help get kids reading and be curious about the world – and is a lot of fun.And at this stage of the competition, when a player’s ability to stop their mind turning to mush when shooting from 12 yards becomes such a big deal, this brilliant piece by Ben on the science of penalty shootouts is probably worth revisiting too. Luka Modric has been reflecting on what Croatia’s victory means for his nation. It turns out that it means a lot.If Brazil-Mexico goes to penalties later on – and it probably will given that a trend has already been set – how El Tri must wish they still had The Emperor, Cuauhtémoc Blanco, among their ranks. His penalty against France in 2010 was a thing of beauty. He began his run up in Namibia and looked for all the world like he was going to leather the ball into space … but brilliantly and delicately found the corner. Blanco is now getting involved in politics. And not everyone in Mexcio is happy about that.On your lunch? Well, read the latest edition of the World Cup Fiver.

I’m fed and watered. Thanks to Ben for jumping in for me. I’d agree that Alireza Beiranvand has been among the most impressive goalkeepers in Russia. He always seemed assured and given that he was in a difficult group he had an awful lot to do and did it well. And what about that throw? It’s just incredible. If you’ve never seen this video, watch him providing an assist with a 70-yard hurl for the ages back in 2014. OK, the opposition goalkeeper doesn’t look up to much but it’s still some throw. More goalkeeper chat: “As a Blue Samurai, it pains me to say that I expect Japan to be undone by yet another Kawashima howler tonight,” fears thesuperscouser, below the line. He will have to go some to keep out Hazard, Lukaku etc, you’d imagine. On keepers, who has been the standout in Russia? Alireza Beiranvand, maybe?A gentle reminder of how it is all shaping up:England are en route to Moscow, via St Petersburg airport, with Gareth Southgate and Ashley Young both on press duties a little later. That would all but confirm that the Manchester United left-back is set to return in place of Danny Rose, with Young likely to be among eight changes as England revert to type from that defeat to Belgium. Dele Alli and Fabian Delph both trained this morning.Another key cog in the Brazil machine, Casemiro, has downplayed his team’s gradual emergence in Russia, after stuttering through their first couple of matches against Costa Rica and Switzerland. “It’s not just Brazil, every team is growing with every match,” he says. “It’s down to anxiety, that first match, that desire to give a good performance. We have to respect Mexico, because they deserve their place in the last 16. But Brazil are getting stronger, playing with style and we are looking strong.”So much has, of course, been said about Brazil’s attacking flair but it is around this time in the tournament that we start to shove goalkeepers under the magnifying glass. And in Alisson, the Roma stopper linked with Chelsea and Real Madrid, they appear to possess a beauty. Jordan Pickford was lambasted, a little unfairly in my eyes, for his display against Belgium, while Manuel Neuer was, finally, criticised last time out.Some depressing but not surprising news here. Despite Fifa filing a criminal complaint against Viagogo, the ticket website is advertising tickets for sale for England v Colombia at as much as £513. The cheapest tickets available to non-Russians (category three) are on sale for as much as £360. Sigh. Right, I’m going to head out for some lunch while Ben Fisher guides you onwards towards Brazil v Mexico for a wee while. Back soon. Some good news for Colombia fans: James Rodriguez’s injury is not as bad as first thought and might be fit enough to face England in the last 16. Here’s the statement from the Colombian FA:James Rodriguez underwent a scan which showed that he is suffering from minor edema (swelling caused by an accumulation of fluid) in his right leg, but that there has been no muscle tearI hope he is fit. When he is on his game he is so good to watch. His pass for Colombia’s third goal was a thing of beauty and worth watching again here. “On the subject of Andrew Mullinder’s MLS-inspired rebooted penalty shootout, how would you explain it to Spain? Their players would actually have to, you know … shoot,” honks Geoffrey Saunders. What if they replaced penalties with rondo? With opposition players being plunged into the circle. Surely being the man in the middle of a Spanish rondo would make you want to retire from football. Who would be the worst at rondo in this tournament? I’m going for Australia. Moscow sounds like a mighty fun place to have been last night if Andrew Roth’s report on the post-win impromptu shindig is anything to go by. Judging by the way Moscow celebrated, Russia have won the World Cup. Were you there? Did you see the men hanging off the scaffolding, swinging around the supporting poles 20 metres up? That Mercedes sedan that opened its trunk to reveal subwoofers blaring Russian club hip-hop? The two girls surfing on top of a black Geländewagen down Tverskaya street? Russia only made it through to the quarter-finals on Sunday night with their unlikely victory on penalties over Spain, but it unleashed a block party the likes of which Moscow has never seen, and likely will never see again.Wow! Sounds like Stuart McCall would have had a belting time if he was there.We’re probably all in agreement that Japan are going to be up against it when they face Belgium tonight. But their coach, Akira Nishino, hopes his gamble of resting players in their previous game against Poland will bear fruit. “We have been here twice in the past in round of 16 but this is different, we haven’t exhausted ourselves yet so we can create a new opportunity,” he said. But Akira, Roberto Martínez rested even more players against England.So how do we improve the penalty shootout? Here’s Andrew Mullinder: “The value of penalty shootouts boils down to this: 1) It’s a way of deciding a drawn match2) It’s brilliantly tense and exciting3) It’s stupidly random and bears very little resemblance to what otherwise decides a game (skill, technique, tactics, fitness, et al). You want to keep points one and two, but improve on three. I think ice hockey style shootouts would do that, where players would still be one on one with the keeper, but have to dribble it forward (or shoot from distance if they wanted). Decide on the specific rules among yourselves -- but it would still be thrilling, while placing a greater premium on the type of player and keeper skill pertinent in a match.Ah, that has been done before Andrew, in the old days of MLS. And you’re right, it’s no less dramatic and does test a player’s skill much more than penalties.Laurence Nunny has also been busy jazzing up football’s rulebook: “How about this, to make the punishment fit the crime:• Jorgensen’s foul was committed once the keeper had been beaten, so award penalty with the keeper required to wait outside the box with the rest of the players. This would also have worked for handball’s on the line, à la Suárez.• Deliberate foul by last man outside the box (previously red card and free kick)  penalty.• In both cases, the chance of scoring a goal from the resulting penalty better reflects the chance that was denied by the foul.”Oliver Whitton reckons Geoff Saunders might be on to something, and he’s using rugby to back him up: “In regards to his idea of penalty goals - while it would be another ‘referee’s interpretation’ challenge, Rugby Union referees have similar interpretation challenges to award penalty tries, and generally do so only in very blatant circumstances much like the incident last night. I think it’s worth thinking about - had Denmark won on penalties last night it would have been a gross injustice.”The Belgian equivalent of Currys might be in trouble if Belgium score a shed load of goals against Japan. According to Dries Mertens a Belgian retailer has promised to reimburse fans who bought TVs specifically to watch the World Cup if Belgium score 16 goals in Russia. They’re currently on nine. This brings the question of “intent” back into play. If I was a retailer looking to balance the books, I’d be asking: “Can you prove that you bought this telly specifically with the intention of only watching the World Cup?” Maybe there’s a Belgian Love Island.Back to the issue Jorgensen’s booking. Here’s an idea from Geoff Saunders: “The Danish player committed the foul because he knew the Croatian would score. That was his motivation. Ergo – a goal should be awarded. Denmark were rewarded by cheating. That is wrong. The lesson is there for every player to learn. Cheat and you might get away with it. The law is inadequate. If Fifa really wants to stop fouls like this then they must punish them. Awarding a goal, like a penalty try in rugby, would go a long way to stopping cheating like this. Before anyone says ‘The player could still have missed’ – a Roger Davis – the point is that the foul was committed because the Danish player was certain Croatia would score. That must be punished. And giving the keeper a chance to save when he had already been beaten is unfair.”No one but Jorgensen knows if he really intended to foul Rebic so to say he was “cheating” is harsh but the point is that a goal was certain in that situation so therefore a penalty and yellow card does not seem like justice. How referees decide which chances that are denied would have certainly led to a goal would also create more problems. For all that football is a simple game it throws up a lot of rules-based problems. Brazil’s renaissance man Paulinho has been talking to The Players Tribune about his move to Barcelona. This quote makes it sound like Lionel Messi is the de facto manager of Barcelona as well as Argentina. All of a sudden, Messi walks straight up to me, looks me in the eye, and says: ‘So ... are we going to Barcelona or not?’ That was it, no explanation, nothing. He turned around and walked away. I didn’t even have time to think. I just said: ‘If you want to take me, I’ll go!’Sticking with Brazil v Mexico, I said on the podcast last night that I think Tite is missing a trick by not playing Roberto Firmino while Philippe Coutinho, who knows him so well from Liverpool, is in such good form. they had such a good understanding at Anfield. Gabriel Jesus is a great player but Firmino is better at holding the line I believe and helps brings shape to the team. I also reckon he would create more space for Neymar. In Brazil, there has been a touching story of Firmino’s former primary school teacher only just realised that her pupil of many years ago, who faced such hardship at home, was in the Brazil team. Here is Adriana Liete talking to Globo: I can’t wait for Brazil v Mexico! Michael Gleeson reckons Mexico might just have a chance today: “Looking at Mexico’s win over Germany, they won because the other team’s backline was pushed higher and the fullbacks had left the defence. If Brazil play Marcelo, he will look to get forward. That could give space to Vela. Mexico may only need one chance.” I think Brazil will score more than one goal so will in all likelihood need two chances or more. Mexico always offer entertainment in the last 16. Here is their recent history of six painful last-16 exits:2014: Controversially beaten 2-1 by Netherlands2010: Beaten 3-1 by Argentina (including a controversial Argentina goal)2006: Beaten 2-1 by Argentina in extra-time in an absolute belter of a game2002: Rafael Marquez sent off in 2-0 defeat by USA1998: Beaten 2-1 by Germany after being 1-0 up and then conceding two late goals1994: Beaten by Bulgaria on penalties with crazy Jorge Campos in goalI think Mexico might explode if the team gets to the quarter-finals. Croatia’s hero last night, Danijel Subasic, came mighty close to being Steve Morrowed. From David Hytner’s match report: The Croatia players threw Subasic up in the air during the celebrations and – in keeping with the tone of the evening – they dropped him. Mercifully Zlatko Dalic, the manager, reported he was not injured. Here’s a cracking Joy of Six on the subject of celebrations gone wrong. My favourite is Stuart McCall. It’s always worth re-familiarising yourself with his tin-fuelled car-dancing antics. “What are your thoughts on the non-award of a red card for the foul leading to Croatia’s penalty last night? Despite supporting Denmark, from my perspective there was no chance Jorgensen could make a clean tackle so it shouldn’t have been classed as a genuine attempt to play the ball,” writes Tove. “He certainly made sure he brought down Rebic and prevented him getting a shot away. If this is how the new rule works it opens the door for defenders to make reckless tackles to deny a clear goalscoring opportunity where they are theoretically trying to play the ball, knowing that they only risk a yellow card as punishment.” My first thought was that Jorgensen should have been immediately sent off. Then I looked at the replays and I could understand how the referee adjudged Jorgensen to have attempted to win the ball cleanly as he is very close to getting something on it. It’s the kind of decision that would look brilliant in the fourth minute of the match as fans would say the decision helped keep the match an even contest, thus making it a better spectacle, but coming at the end of extra-time it seemed a real injustice given that Rebic was a millisecond away from rolling the ball home. I think when intention comes into any decision a referee has to make it can lead to players getting crafty. Pique’s handball yesterday was a case in point. I’m sure he intended his arm to be up there to help stop the ball but by turning his back he made it look as though it was accidental. Many players may now deliberately foul others in similar situations and plead honesty in an attempt to get a yellow, as you say. The World Cup often sets trends. Let’s see if this is one.“Not practising penalties is INSANE!” roars Duncan in Tokyo, referencing Japan coach Akira Nishino’s revelation that he is not asking his players to work on spot-kicks. “A striker taking a penalty to win the game in the 89th minute is under exactly the same pressure as any player in a shootout. Would you tell him not to bother practising penalties?” Nope. I’m in agreement with you Duncan, particularly so when you look back at the last World Cup, when six of the eight last 16 matches went to extra-time and three were settled in a shootout. You can’t replicate pressure when practising penalties but surely knowing that you have practised something over and over again helps settle your nerves a little bit when that buttock-clenching moment arrives.“Re the Pod’s ridiculous assertion that no great goalkeepers wore short sleeves,” begins Yazan Badran. “Have we already forgotten he who is (still) the best goalkeeper in the world for me.”Thanks Niall, although I must say I’m still reeling from the news that you’re a fan of the Golden Goal rule. I quite like watching footballers limited by fatigue so that they look almost normal and 30 minutes of walking football is worth it if there’s a shootout at the end. “But what could be more dramatic than a sudden death winner?” says Niall, when I pull him up on this. Penalties Niall! Penalties!

During these summer weeks, I buy a bag most days. They’re almost always best eaten straight out of the bag, but there are a few recipes where cooked cherries rival fresh. One is this cherry cobbler, an intensely sweet-sour party between cherry and its best friend, almond. The other is a cherry salad, the fruit quickly pickled and roasted, popping against the salad leaves and buttermilk dressing.I make this in peak cherry season, when they are most affordable. At other times of the year, you could use some cheaper frozen cherries, or even some pitted and roughly chopped red plums in place of half the cherries.1kg cherries, pitted1 tbsp amaretto or frangelico (optional)Seeds from 1 vanilla pod or 1 tsp vanilla paste2-4 tbsp honeyZest of 1 unwaxed lemonFor the topping60g almonds, skin on125g white spelt flour1 tsp baking powder50g raw cane sugar or demerara sugar100g unsalted butter, chilled1 pinch flaky sea saltTo serveCreme fraiche, yoghurt or ice-creamHeat the oven to 240C465Fgas 9. First, make the topping. Blitz the almonds in a food processor until they resemble fine breadcrumbs, then add the flour, baking powder and sugar and pulse a couple of times to combine. Cut the butter into cubes and add to the food processor with the salt. Blitz again, until the mixture resembles rough breadcrumbs. Add a tablespoon of water and pulse again until it comes together into a firm dough.Put the cherries, liqueur (if using) and vanilla into a bowl and mix to combine. Grease a 20cm baking dish, and spoon in the cherries, to cover the bottom of the dish. Drizzle over the honey and use a tablespoon to dollop the dough on top, leaving gaps for the juices to bubble through.Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the topping has risen and is a deep gold. Top with a few more toasted almonds, if you like, and serve with creme fraiche and a swirl of honey or some ice-cream.I use red-tipped little gems here, but butterhead, oakleaf, lollo rosso and frisée would also work. If you can’t find buttermilk, use yoghurt thinned with a splash of milk for the dressing. Some goat’s cheese or goat’s curd would be a nice addition, too.For the salad200g cherries, pitted and halvedA few sprigs thyme, leaves pickedZest and juice of 1 unwaxed lemon2 tbsp red-wine vinegarOlive oilSalt and black pepper4 slices good bread4 little gem lettucesFor the dressing125ml buttermilk or thinned yoghurt (see note)1 tsp runny honey2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oilHeat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6. Lay the halved cherries on a baking tray, scatter with the thyme and grate over the lemon zest. Drizzle with the vinegar, then with the oil, and season with salt and pepper. Toss the lot together and roast for 15-20 minutes.Tear the bread into chunks, put on another baking tray and season well. Drizzle generously with olive oil, then put in the oven for the last 15 minutes with the cherries. When time is up, the cherries should have darkened a little, their flavour intensified, and the bread should be crisp on the outside, chewy in the middle and deeply golden.To make the dressing, whisk all the ingredients in a jug, or shake in a tightly sealed jar, taste and season.Wash, dry and quarter the lettuces and scatter them on a plate. Once the cherries have cooled a little, scatter them over the lettuce and bread, and drizzle generously with the dressing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03a938f49bd36c2732da79d0ba29d5e15d34c7b7/0_0_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d8bbfe966b95b8652c9181899d63660","title":"sleep with as many women as i can lose girlfriend","story":"I know it’s selfish and that I might get caught, but I can’t help myself.

But while acting on your desires might be physically fulfilling in the short term, you seem to recognise that the choices you make could reduce your overall quality of life. Perhaps you are just not ready for monogamy if that is required by your girlfriend, you must decide whether you can comply or not. You were honest enough to mention being largely drawn to “the persuasion and the chase”, so it might be useful to consider what the real meaning of sex is for you beyond the erotic thrill itself. For some people, it is being validated as an attractive, socially adept, successful or sexually competent person, and a “conquest” is therefore affirming for those who lack confidence. For such people, the lure of this affirmation – especially from someone new – is very strong, and the pursuit of it can feel like an “addiction”. Try to improve your sense of self-worth in nonsexual ways. Hopefully you will be able to find new strategies to feel more secure as a man.

I have rented for years as I have always assumed that I would never be in a position to secure a mortgage on my salary which is currently just under £30,000. However, my family have recently been able to offer me help with a deposit – a gift, not a loan - and I am now considering my options. I have spoken with a mortgage adviser who believes I may qualify for a traditional mortgage but I have been looking at the London help-to-buy scheme and wondered if there was an advantage in applying for that, even if I have financial support.With personal savings and family assistance I can put forward a deposit of up to £50,000, with additional money reserved for legal fees. I would – ideally – be looking for a one-bed flat in the zone two region of Southwark, but am not picky. For the purposes of work I need to be able to get to Waterloo or Clapham Junction stations fairly easily very early in the morning.My job is as secure as any job can be and there is a small chance of an increased salary in the next year or so, taking it up to the £35,000 mark. Is help to buy a reasonable option under the circumstances and are there any particular risks or disadvantages? DWHowever, all is not doom and gloom. With a budget of £170,000 – so not including help-to-buy assistance – you could easily afford to buy more than the minimum share in a shared ownership property. With these, you buy a share in a property and pay rent on the share owned by the housing association and you are allowed to increase your share in a process known as “staircasing”. The other good news is that according to Rightmove, there are a lot of shared ownership flats both in Southwark and in easy reach of Waterloo and Clapham Junction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/371d12bb8c3b0d3459640f9827e5d8eceae6a826/0_142_2984_1791/master/2984.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=689317838f64d7d4d387cbd0023bc2aa","title":"liam payne and cheryl split after two year relationship","story":"The pop star power couple ask for privacy for their son Bear ‘as we navigate our way through this together’Liam Payne and Cheryl, a celebrity power couple equally beloved of pop fans and gossip columnists, have announced they are splitting after a two and a half year relationship.The pair put out a joint statement on each of their Twitter accounts, saying they were “sad to announce that we are going our separate ways.

One former Tory leader, Sir Robert Peel, decided to break his manifesto pledge and passed legislation with the majority of his party voting the other way. Burt accused Rees-Mogg of being part of an “ideological clique” in a tweet after the article was published. “Just tired of this endless threat and counter-threat,” he wrote. “Why don’t we want the best for the UK than for our own ideological cliques? And there are others in this negotiation as far as I’m aware?”Duncan accused Rees-Mogg of “insolence” and said his “lecturing and threatening the PM is just too much”. He said the MP’s behaviour risked “debasing government, party, country and himself”.“The PM must be given maximum latitude and backing,” he tweeted. “The ideological right are a minority despite their noise and should pipe down.”Another minister, Richard Harrington, said his colleagues should “stop putting their own dogma above the good of the country and the party”.The junior business minister tweeted: “We should all support the prime minister and the businesses that employ so many people in good jobs and export so much.” Criticism also came from Tory backbenchers, including Sir Nicholas Soames, Simon Hoare and Sarah Wollaston, with Soames tweeting Rees-Mogg should “shut up” and “put a sock in it”.“Peel was also delivering freer trade and cheap bread which the growing industrial towns needed and demanded … Peel put country before party.”Hoare’s tweets drew further significant support from backbenchers. The Scottish Tory MP Paul Masterton tweeted “well said” and others retweeted the post, including Nick Boles, Nicky Morgan, Simon Hart, Bob Neill, Antoinette Sandbach and the former Cabinet Office minister Ben Gummer, one of the architects of the 2017 Tory manifesto.Wollaston, part of a contingent of soft-Brexit Tory MPs that has sometimes rebelled against the government, said the corn laws were “wrong then just as business-destroying hard Brexit would be wrong now … Trade with our closest neighbours needs to be frictionless and free.”Wollaston was one of the MPs depicted as “mutineers” on the front of the  before a vote on the EU withdrawal bill in parliament in December. She suggested there would be no similar treatment of pro-Brexit MPs who undermined the prime minister, saying they were “repeatedly threatening the PM unless she bends to their will”. “They should take note there is no parliamentary majority to just walk away and destroy business with a disastrous hard Brexit,” she tweeted.The Tory MP Vicky Ford, a former MEP, said the majority of MPs did not back Rees-Mogg’s stance. “If this becomes a binary choice between staying in the single market and customs union or no deal, then I do not believe there is a majority for no deal,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The Scottish Conservative Andrew Bowie, who is a member of the ERG, was also cautiously critical, tweeting: “My Conservative party are a commonsense, pragmatic, free trading, liberal party that governs and takes commonsense decisions in the national interest – not in the interests of an ideological clique ... on whatever side of an argument.”Richard Benyon, another backbencher, said: “I think we would all benefit from a period of silence from the ultras on both ends.”Downing Street would not comment on whether the prime minister believed Rees-Mogg was undermining her.

But EU sources who have seen drafts of the long-awaited British white paper said the proposals would never be accepted.May’s white paper is expected to propose the UK remaining indefinitely in a single market for goods after Brexit, to avoid the need for checks at the Irish border. While the UK is offering concessions on financial services, it wants restrictions on free movement of people – a long-standing no-go for the EU.Jean-Claude Piris, a former head of the EU council’s legal service, said it would be impossible for the EU to split the “four freedoms” underpinning the bloc’s internal market, which are written into the 1957 treaty that founded the European project: free movement of goods, services, capital and people.“The EU is in difficulties at the moment the one and only success which glues all these countries together is a little bit the money and the internal market,” Piris said. “If you fudge the internal market by allowing a third state to choose what they want ... it is the beginning of the end.”Some sources expect the UK to abandon these plans. In an attempt to sweeten the pill they are prepared to offer an extra year of transition to smooth Britain’s EU exit.The British government believes the EU is guilty of its own cherry-picking, for example, by demanding the status quo on fishing quotas in exchange for zero tariffs on goods. Moreover, British officials think a single market in industrial goods is a win for the EU, which sells a surplus of manufactured products to the UK. Piris disagrees: “It is in their short-term economic interest, but it is a short-term myopic view, it is not what the leaders of the EU will do.”Responding to the latest EU views on the white paper, a UK government source said: “Rather than getting hot under the collar over unfounded media speculation, we’d suggest a better approach would be to wait for the white paper to be published before responding to it.”Theresa May is hoping for a warmer reception from EU countries. But Spain’s foreign minister has already said an “angry” France and Germany would reject these plans. “Germany will say no, France will say no, Spain will say no,” said Josep Borrell, who also described Brexit as “a pain in the ass”.At an EU summit on Friday, the EU’s 27 leaders, minus May, spent no more than 15 minutes discussing Brexit, while only three or four countries intervened. A terse statement issued by the leaders called on the UK to come up with “realistic and workable proposals”.This language was drafted in anticipation that “cake may be coming”, said another EU source, who described expectations of the Chequers meeting as modest.“The real problem is that if the result of Chequers is not unambiguous, the reality is that a lot of time, the summer, will be lost. And then you are really under a heavy time constraint,” said the source. “Yes, it increases the chances of a no-deal.”A spokesperson at the Department for Exiting the European Union referred back to remarks made by the Brexit secretary, David Davis, when the government announced the publication of the white paper.Describing the paper as “our most significant publication on the EU since the referendum”, Davis said: “It will communicate our ambition for the UK’s future relationship with the EU, in the context of our vision for the UK’s future role in the world.” He also said it would “include detailed, ambitious and precise explanations of our positions ... it should set out what will change and what will feel different outside the EU.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93cbd885fd3db6e83c033f4f44494c16f23f30c0/0_118_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b22e6bb842a4efc0ed97a336f0ab0655","title":"uk ministers to fund saatchi campaign for tunisian government","story":"Critics dismiss project as PR campaign designed to support country’s contested policies The British government is paying M\u0026ampC Saatchi to run a media campaign for the Tunisian government in an attempt to win voters over reforms that have sparked some of the largest protests in the north African state since the Arab spring.The advertising agency – known for its punchy political advertising for the Conservative party – has been hired to run a campaign “targeted towards the Tunisian public”, according to documents.Its objectives are to “improve public awareness of the government’s role in planning and delivering economic reforms” that are being undertaken as part of an IMF-backed plan to cut its budget deficit and boost growth. The same documents – setting out M\u0026ampC’s appointment – state that an initial phase of the Saatchi campaign, which involves the agency having a base in Tunis, targets Tunisians aged 18 to 35. The country’s young people have been at the forefront of protests that have grown in intensity since the beginning of the year when the government raised prices of staples and introduced new taxes, as it comes under pressure to deliver on the reforms, which are linked to a $2.9bn (£2.2bn) IMF loan. The money for Saatchi is coming from the secretive Conflict, Security and Stability Fund (CSSF), which was set up under the auspices of several key government departments including the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development. It has been the focus of significant concern among MPs and the independent aid watchdog over the lack of transparency, accountability and leadership surrounding the £1.2bn pot.A report issued this year by the Independent Commission for Aid Impact, which scrutinises UK aid spending and reports to the Commons, also criticised serious shortcomings in the way that the programme operates, including the risk it could be working with human rights abusers.The assistance to the Tunisians comes against the backdrop of a move by the UK to focus more resources on the Sahel, which civil servants have identified as a breeding ground for extremism and source of migrants to Europe. Lloyd Russell-Moyle, a Labour MP on parliament’s international development committee, said: “I can think of no better example of the cynicism of this government than financing a PR campaign to support cuts to the Tunisian state by using state money in Britain that it claims is promoting peace and security overseas.“The government won’t tell the public or parliament what this fund, which is worth over £1bn, is spent on and the little evidence we do have suggests that the rot runs deep.”He added: “In light of these new allegations, it seems prudent to shut down the fund pending the review’s findings.”Asad Rehman, executive director of the charity War on Want, said that projects of the type undertaken in Tunisia “appear to be more about supporting governments with their PR rather than getting at the causes of the protests, which are rooted in deeply economic issues around inequality”.“People would be genuinely shocked to read that once again – whether it’s PFIs or something else – with British companies being brought in to aid governments in forcing through policies which are are highly contested, creates more friction and ultimately lead to a securitised response when people protest against them.”M\u0026ampC Saatchi were appointed to provide services only to the Cabinet Office and do not work directly with the Tunisian government on this project, according to the Foreign Office. The Foreign Office also pointed out that the ICAI report, while critical in parts, highlights a number of successes from fund’s programmes.M\u0026ampC Saatchi said it does not comment on government contracts.Tunisia, the country where the 2011 Arab spring uprisings began, has long been the company’s remaining bright spot, although there are fears that its democratic experiment could be put at risk by economic instability. Prime minister Youssef Chahed said earlier this year that his administration is working to reduce spending, revive exports and introduce social measures to meet the concerns of demonstrators.

Other allies are following suit,” he said.“It is in the best interest of both our nations for the UK to remain the US partner of choice.”Trump is pressing all members of Nato to spend more on defence and will make the plea in person at a Nato summit in Brussels next week.Since Trump became president in January 2017, French diplomats and the military have been watching with interest a ergence between London and Washington on a host of issues, raising hopes that it might yet supplant the UK.The period is in contrast with 2003, when relations between Paris and Washington were strained because France declined to join the US in invading Iraq. Mattis argued in the letter: “I am concerned that your ability to continue to provide this critical military foundation for diplomatic success is at risk of erosion, while together we face a world awash with change.”The letter was sent to Williamson on 12 June, three days after a visit by Mattis to London. Williamson would be unlikely to have leaked it without first seeking approval from his American counterpart.If Mattis sent the letter to help Williamson in his campaign for more money, it marks an unusual departure for a senior US politician, who would normally not intervene in British domestic politics in such a public way.Mattis said that while it is in the best interests of the US and UK that Britain remains the partner of choice, “the UK will need to invest and maintain robust military capability”.“It is not for me to tell you how to prioritize your domestic spending priorities, but I hope the UK will soon be able to share with us a clear and fully funded forward defence blueprint that will allow me to plan our own future engagement with you from a position of strength and confidence,” he said.“A global nation like the UK, with interests and commitments around the world, will require a level of defence spending beyond what we would expect from allies with only regional interests. Absent a vibrant military arm, world peace and stability would be at further risk.”The Treasury has told Williamson he will receive no further increases.Mattis’s position in the Trump administration is under threat and he has been sidelined on recent key issues.The UK government is struggling to finalise its defence review before the Nato summit as promised. Unable to agree on more spending, the choice is increasingly between publishing a vague statement of intent or not publishing anything at all.“The defence secretary launched the modernising defence programme to strengthen our armed forces in the face of intensifying threats.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b492830b2b80cdb44681272f10333ec1ebd57e9c/0_722_4800_2881/master/4800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a9792b87e536427d14fac585811628b","title":"artificial ovary could help women conceive after chemotherapy fertility","story":"Development could allow women to have children after fertility-damaging treatmentsDoctors have made an “artificial ovary” from human tissue and eggs in a bid to help women have children after cancer treatment and other therapies that can damage female fertility.The team in Copenhagen showed that a lab-made ovary could keep human eggs alive for weeks at a time, raising hopes that the approach could one day help women have families after harsh treatments such as chemo- and radiotherapy.Implanted artificial ovaries might also help women with conditions such as multiple sclerosis and the blood disorder beta thalassaemia, which can require aggressive fertility-harming therapies, along with patients who go through an early menopause.Women who face a cancer diagnosis can already have ovarian tissue removed and frozen before they have fertility-harming treatments. When they have the all-clear, the tissue is put back and the women can go on to have babies naturally.For most patients the procedure is safe, but certain cancers, such as ovarian or leukaemia, can invade the ovarian tissue itself. This means that when frozen tissue is thawed and put back, there is a risk the disease will take hold again. For this reason, ovarian tissue freezing is rarely offered to high-risk patients.Susanne Pors and others at the Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen believe artificial ovaries could be a safer option. To make one, they used chemicals to strip donated ovarian tissue of all of its cells, including any lurking cancer cells. This left a bare tissue “scaffold” made largely of collagen, the protein that gives skin its strength. The doctors then seeded this scaffold with hundreds of human follicles, the tiny sacs that hold early-stage eggs.On Monday, Pors will tell the annual meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Barcelona how the team implanted an artificial ovary holding 20 human follicles into a mouse and found that a quarter of them survived for at least three weeks. In that time, blood vessels had begun to grow around the ovary to keep it nourished in the animal.“This is the first proof that we can actually support these egg cells. It’s an important step along the road,” Pors told the . “But it will be many years before we can put this into a woman.” It could take five to 10 years of work before artificial ovaries are ready for human trials, she added.Nick Macklon, medical director at London Women’s Clinic, said that while there was a low risk of contracting cancer from frozen ovarian tissue, it is a danger that doctors take seriously. “There have been certain cancers where we can’t use this procedure because of this concern,” he said. “It’s an exciting development. This is early days for the work but it’s a very interesting proof of concept.”Stuart Lavery, a consultant gynaecologist at Hammersmith Hospital, added: “It’ll be very reassuring, if this work reaches fruition, that patients can have the transplantation knowing there is no risk of transplanting the cancer back into them. The beauty of this is that many of the women who have ovarian grafts go and get pregnant naturally, they don’t have to go through IVF.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3c11c420938c0095867778f89a58d9317150770/0_114_700_420/master/700.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8dded946a8cfacad12834ae90d0442e9","title":"first confirmed image of a newborn planet revealed pds70","story":"Nascent planet seen carving a path through the disc of gas and dust surrounding the very young star PDS70It is a moment of birth that has previously proved elusive, but astronomers say they now have the first confirmed image of the formation of a planet.The startling snapshot shows a bright blob – the nascent planet – travelling through the dust and gas surrounding a young star, known as PDS70, thought to be about 370 light years from Earth.The black circle in the centre of the image, to the left of the planet, is a filter to block the light from the star, enabling other features of the system to be seen.Captured by the Sphere instrument of the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope, the planet – a gas giant with a mass greater than Jupiter – is about as far from its star as Uranus is from our sun, with further analyses revealing that it appears to have a cloudy atmosphere and a surface temperature of 1000C. “These discs around young stars are the birthplaces of planets, but so far only a handful of observations have detected hints of baby planets in them,” said Miriam Keppler of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany, a lead author of the research published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics. However, other ground-based observations have not yielded conclusive evidence.Young planets have also previously been identified using the orbiting Kepler telescope. But that method, said Keppler, also has limitations, relying on a dimming of the star’s light as a body moves in between it and the telescopeKeppler adds that the star around which the newly discovered planet orbits is just five to six million years old, noting that the planet could be even younger.Astronomers, she says, now have a big task ahead, carrying out observations to explore how the planet develops as well as tracing its orbit around the star, a journey thought to take about 120 years for the planet to complete.Dr Zoe Leinhardt, a computational astrophysicist specialising in planet formation at the University of Bristol and who was not involved in the research, welcomed the discovery.“This is a relatively young star that shows all of the indications that there should be a planet there, and there is one,” she said. “For astronomers, most of the time, it is very rare that we are really able to show a picture. We just have to make an interpretation,” she said. “This is almost undeniable, so it is very exciting. It does suggest that our idea for the way planet formation works is correct.”Leinhardt added that it is possible the planet has neighbours, or that other planets could appear over time. “The way that planets form, a large Jupiter-mass planet would be the easiest to see … and also those large planets would form more quickly,” she said. “What this does indicate is that planet formation is ongoing in that system.”Dr Dimitris Stamatellos, leader the of the theoretical star formation and exoplanets group at the University of Central Lancashire, was also enthusiastic. “This is an impressive discovery as this is maybe the first unambiguous direct observation of a planet that is caught while still forming within a young protoplanetary disc,” he said.But, he added, while the discovery has confirmed some theoretical predictions, it has also thrown up a conundrum. “It remains a mystery how such a massive planet can form at this unusual large distance from its parent star,” he said. “The standard planet formation theory has difficulty in explaining this planet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97256ef44e511b3e0ff230cf3b1b093cb75eb779/0_178_4789_2875/master/4789.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a18e18929e4d267a2063dff92a20f677","title":"alexandria ocasio cortez democratic politics","story":"Less than a week after her stunning primary win, Ocasio-Cortez is told she’s too leftwing to win key midwestern votes. Not surprisingly, she disagreesIn April 2016, Bernie Sanders’ political revolution fizzled to a halt in New York. Hillary Clinton’s adopted home elevated her to within striking distance of the Democratic nomination. The loss was a devastating blow to Sanders’ progressive supporters.And yet that setback helped prepare the ground for one of this year’s most shocking political upsets.In a primary last Tuesday, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old leftwing activist and Sanders organizer, defeated Joe Crowley, a 10-term House Democrat and potential contender for speaker, in an outer-borough New York district.“We’re in the middle of a movement in this country,” Ocasio-Cortez told CNN after her win. “I feel this movement, but that movement is going to happen from the bottom up. That movement is going to come from voters.”Progressives hailed the win as proof of a growing grassroots movement.“Just like in 1916 when we saw the beginning of a progressive movement in response to the Gilded Age, I believe the Trump era is going to bring a progressive renaissance in this country,” said Ro Khanna, the only member of Congress to endorse Ocasio-Cortez – albeit in a dual recommendation with Crowley.Ocasio-Cortez, Khanna said, “is a harbinger of that new progressive movement”.And yet, for a Democratic party in search of a new identity in the Trump era, her victory has offered little immediate clarity.“When you knock off somebody like this, it’s very significant – and it doesn’t happen by accident,” said Jim Kessler of the centrist thinktank Third Way.But he added that Ocasio-Cortez’s win was less an endorsement of her leftwing ideology than a reflection of Democratic voters’ current preference for fresh faces and female candidates.On Sunday, the Illinois senator Tammy Duckworth suggested Ocasio-Cortez’s leftwing politics could alienate moderate midwestern voters.“I think that you can’t win the White House without the midwest,” Duckworth told CNN’s State of the Union. “And I don’t think that you can go too far to the left and still win the midwest.“Coming from a midwestern state, I think you need to be able to talk to the industrial midwest. You need to listen to the people there in order to win an election nationwide.”While it is true that in 2016 Sanders did not win the nationwide contest, he did beat Clinton in Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin, midwestern states which backed Obama but abandoned the Democrats for Trump. Two years later, in one of the most liberal enclaves in America, Ocasio-Cortez ran on a progressive platform that included several core policy issues proposed by Sanders.She pledged support for Medicare for All and tuition-free public college, backed a federal jobs-guarantee program and called for Congress to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).That earned her the endorsement of the Democratic Socialists of America, a fact upon which Republicans have duly seized, claiming her win shows Democrats have moved too far to the left.On Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez also appeared on the talk shows. On NBC’s Meet the Press, she was asked how she would “sell” her views to an older generation of Americans perhaps “afraid of the S-word”.“It’s part of what I am,” she said. “It’s not all of what I am. And I think that that’s a very important distinction. I’m an educator. I’m an organizer. And I believe that what we’re really seeing is just a movement for healthcare, housing and education in the United States.”Bill de Blasio agrees. The mayor of New York backed Crowley but in a statement issued after Ocasio-Cortez’s win, he said the Democratic party was “in a deep and fast process of change” and declared its future to be “decidedly progressive”.Until Tuesday, progressives had achieved only handful of notable electoral successes while suffering losses in Virginia, Ohio and Iowa. But there are other signs their message is resonating. A third of Senate Democrats, including many prospective 2020 candidates, and more than half of House Democrats support Sanders’ single-payer healthcare plan. Calls for minimum wage are widespread and many have adopted the anti-Wall Street rhetoric that was a trademark of Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign.In the House, Democrats must gain 23 seats if they are to retake the majority. As primary season nears the home stretch, the party has expressed confidence in a crop of contenders who have emerged in battleground districts.Speaking anonymously, an aide to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) argued that primary voters have largely unified around Democrats with the best chances of unseating Republicans. Twenty-seven of the party’s 29 “red to blue” candidates have won their races so far, the aide said – adding that many of those candidates track toward the center of the party, especially on healthcare and the economy.After Tuesday’s election, Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, said Ocasio-Cortez’s win was a reflection of the party’s “vitality” but was not indicative of a wider shift in its beliefs.“They made a choice in one district,” she said, adding that the fact 27,000 voters in a liberal district elected a more progressive candidate was “about that district” and “not to be viewed as something that stands for anything else”.“I think that there are a lot of districts in this country that are like New York 14,” she told NBC, “that have changed a lot in the last 20 years and whose representation has not.”Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran political consultant based in New York, said Crowley’s defeat should set off alarm bells for incumbents of either party.“The electorate is angry and both parties are in serious trouble,” he said. “The schism is huge and the coalitions are brittle. The difference is that the Republicans found one angry man to unite their anger.”Ocasio-Cortez said she felt such frustration knocking on doors in Queens and the Bronx. That sentiment, she told CNN, extended beyond “just one district”.After her win, she joined Sanders in endorsing Brent Welder, a labor lawyer and former Sanders delegate who is running in a Republican-held suburban Kansas City district that Clinton won narrowly. His August primary will likely be the next major test of the strength of the left.Like Ocasio-Cortez, Welder embraces single-payer healthcare and rejects corporate donations. Though his district is very far from New York, he is confident “progressive values” can resonate across demographic and geographic ides.“Her support in this race really helps us prove to the voters that this is the way to win and the way to achieve good progressive policy,” Welder told the .New York 14 is a safe Democratic seat. Next year, Ocasio-Cortez will almost certainly be in Washington. She has vowed to bring a “caucus” with her.“There’s a real hunger out there among voters for boldness and change agents,” said congressman Raul Grijalva, a co-chair of the House Progressive Caucus. “That’s what she presented and she won."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e6a5a777c95811e72405583ac10165d22c87b44/0_268_3872_2324/master/3872.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96cce205ea1600b04fb906afefd8d21c","title":"world cup brazil players single mothers","story":"Tournament has thrown spotlight on the player’s mothers whose hard-luck life stories resonate with ordinary BraziliansRound the corner from a gang member with a pistol in his waistband and an automatic rifle in his hands, the Women’s Bar in Rio’s Complexo do Alemão favela was showing the World Cup on a big TV.Among the crowd watching the Brazil-Serbia game, women in team shirts outnumbered men, while children bounced on a trampoline or queued to have Brazilian flags painted on their cheeks.“You meet everyone here. There’s a great vibe,” said Maira Quirino, 26 – who like many of those at the bar – is a single mother. The Seleção has so far had a successful if unspectacular World Cup. But away from the pitch, this tournament has thrown the spotlight on the player’s mothers whose hard-luck life stories appear to resonate with ordinary Brazilians in a way that the team’s more glamorous wives and girlfriends do not.According to a widely-shared story in the Brazilian edition of El País, six of the players who lined up against Serbia – Miranda, Thiago Silva, Marcelo, Casemiro, Paulinho and Gabriel Jesus – grew up without fathers. Many of Brazil’s great players have come from backgrounds of crushing poverty.And their mothers connect with ordinary Brazilian women because they have lived similar lives, said Debora Diniz, a professor of anthropology at the University of Brasília. That contrasts with the upscale lifestyle enjoyed by of players’ wives and girlfriends – who in many cases are lighter-skinned, unlike the team which is a typically Brazilian racial mix.In Brazil – and other South American countries – feminism is on the rise and the issues it raises are increasingly discussed on television soap operas, said Leticia Bahia, a consultant to the United Nations Foundation and co-founder of feminist site AzMina. “The idea that you have to stay in a marriage because of the children has really collapsed,” she said.At the Women’s Bar, Quirino’s friend Daiane Oliveira, 23 – who has the name of her daughter Camilly, 7, tattooed on her calf – said Brazilian mothers are increasingly choosing to go it alone if relationships aren’t working out. “Brazilian women today are independent. They don’t need men for anything.”A grimmer factor in Brazil’s growing number of single mothers is the country’s ban on abortion, which forces many women into unwanted pregnancies, said Thaiz Leão, 28, who runs a Facebook page called Mãe Solo (Single Mother) with 80,000 followers.“The father can abandon the child and the woman cannot,” Leão said. Brazil’s entrenched machismo is also a factor, she said: many men regard infidelity as their birthright and refuse to help at home. “We deserve better relationships,” Leão said.For many women, the spotlight on the team’s mothers has been been a timely reminder of where the players came from. “None of them are middle class,” said Mariluce Souza, 36, who runs the Favela Art project in the Complexo do Alemão.Vera Lúcia, mother of Manchester City and Brazil forward Gabriel Jesus, is a former maid who raised him and his three brothers alone. Now, however, she often appears on chat shows and toured Russia – alongside Neymar’s mother Nadine and Fernandinho’s mother Ane – for a six-part TV Globo series called As Matrioskas – The Russian Dolls. Her strong, supportive relationship with her 21-year-old son, a star at Manchester City, resonated with mothers in the crowd at the Women’s Bar.“Gabriel Jesus is from a favela and was raised by his mother,” says Rita de Cassia, 38, a single mother of three children – the middle of whom, Andry, 12, also dreams of becoming a footballer. Brazil’s World Cup focus on footballing sons and mothers from tough neighbourhoods was encapsulated in a photograph which went viral earlier this monthWallace Rocha, 12, from Rio’s Vila Cruzeiro favela wanted a shirt with midfielder Philippe Coutinho’s name, but neither his mother, Sandra de Oliveira, 47, an unemployed cleaner, nor his stepfather could afford one. De Oliveira asked a local seamstress to knock one up, promising to pay later. Photographer Bruno Itan captured the pair watching Brazil beat Costa Rica photo – then launched an online campaign to get it to Coutinho.The photo went viral and four hours later, Coutinho replied with a video message.Wallace too wants to become a footballer, his mother said. “It’s my dream too,” she said. “It’s a good profession for him, to get him off the streets.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b3025b2b76b0e67586ff22acb1761b05061c3c3/0_147_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e176b2332bd4d882a8e0e2a6e687503","title":"amlo wins mexico election in pictures","story":"Supporters of the Juntos Haremos Historia (Together We Will Make History) presidential candidate, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, – fill Zócalo square in central Mexico City to celebrate his dramatic election victory.

A reader called Chris contacted us in connection with Irish Ferries. Towards the end of April he wanted to bring his father-in-law from Castlebar to Todmorden in England. The man is “an elderly MS patient who has recently suffered a second debilitating stroke”. He is originally from the UK and has been in Ireland for 12 years. He needed to ensure that the journey ran smoothly. After picking his father-in-law up from the nursing home in Castlebar they made good time on the motorway and arrived promptly for the Dublin Swift sailing leaving at 2.30pm. “We checked in as normal and were directed to the entrance of the vessel. On arrival at the ramp we were asked to pull over to one side. After a good while it became apparent that there may be a problem. After another while I got out of our vehicle to try to clarify what was happening as a stream of other vehicles was being let on.” Chris stressed a number of times to the staff the urgency of the situation and that they had a strict schedule to adhere to “and that as a matter of priority we needed to travel on the sailing we were booked on. We were told that that would not be possible and that we would have to travel on a later craft.”Then Irish Ferries staff said the party could travel on a Stena Line ferry that was due to arrive later on that evening in Holyhead. “Faced with no other option we returned to check-in where we were directed onto the Stena Line ferry. This vessel didn’t arrive in Dublin until much later that evening which meant that our scheduled arrival in Todmorden around dinner time would now be approaching midnight. “This journey was a lot longer than we anticipated and a lot longer than we had planned for. This was not only deeply stressful but necessitated making contingent plans at the nursing home we were travelling to which had been informed days previously of our travel plans and had allocated staff especially to deal our situation,” he says. He adds that all the stresses of the family “were exacerbated by the fact that we hadn’t anticipated and were never informed that we may not be able to travel on a newly refurbished vessel that had only been in operation with Irish Ferries for a short while.” She said the company immediately sought to put alternative arrangements in place and booked him on the next sailing out of Dublin. “We fully understand that this caused inconvenience as the Irish Ferries Dublin Swift was due in Holyhead at 16.30, while the Stena ferry was not due to arrive til 18.20 and was, we believe, further delayed.” She said the company recognised “that the events on the day caused problems. As well as arranging alternative travel with Stena free of charge, we refunded Mr Leach’s meals, upgraded his return journey, offered a €100 voucher and a further free trip on Dublin Swift. We would like to apologise once again for the inconvenience and to assure our customer of our best efforts to provide a smooth journey on his next trip.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3547008.1530195823!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sky s the limit customer foiled as he tries to cancel broadband contract","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRepeated calls to Sky failed to produce the desired response for the frustrated customer. Photograph: David JonesPAA reader named Paul Davy got in touch because he wanted us to know about what he called Sky’s Hotel California policy, a policy which, he says, means “you can check out anytime you like but you can never leave”.He has spent much of the past 12 months trying to cancel his Sky broadband account to no avail so far and in his mail he promises a “quick” version of the story but – to be honest – it is not at all quick so you might want to settle in.“I was approached by an eir salesman in May 2017 as they were installing fibre in our remote area of Co Galway and he advised that if we didn’t sign up with eir we’d be waiting more than two years for Sky fibre,” his story starts.Davy says he found the salesman “a bit pushy”, and having had Sky TV for eight years and its broadband for around three years “albeit with miserable download speeds” he decided to contact\u0026nbspSky before he signed with eir.He did that on May 25th last year “and they confirmed I was out of contract but also advised that if my neighbours were getting fibre from eir then there was no reason that Sky couldn’t provide me with fibre – more or less rubbishing what the eir salesman had told me,” he says.So he renewed his contract with Sky “on the clear understanding that what they were telling me was correct”, he says.“I can still hear myself spelling that out as a condition of renewal and Sky reconfirming that if my neighbours have fibre I’ll have fibre through Sky. I was even willing to wait one or two months for the fibre.”He never got his fibre. He called Sky “a few times” over the next few months, each time giving them a history of events, and each time he says he was given conflicting information.Last September a Sky agent confirmed the company couldn’t provide fibre in his\u0026nbsparea “as eir had pulled in new lines to my neighbours and hadn’t released them yet to other providers. As I was running a home office on still miserable download\u0026nbspspeeds I cancelled Sky broadband and phone that day”, Davy says.He was, however, persuaded to keep the TV package with the promise of a discount. Then he signed up for eir fibre and phone and the Sky agent confirmed that he would send the cancellation request to the relevant department.He got his eir fibre installed a few days later “without any hassle”, and all was well. Then he realised Sky were still taking the full amount of direct debit out of his account when they should have only be charging him for his discounted TV package.He contacted Sky again on October 6th. An agent confirmed his cancellation had not been processed but she said she would contact the Cancellation Department and ring him back that day. The agent did not call back that day but he missed a call from her the following day “and she left a message to say she’d call me the following Wednesday – four days later”.The call came as promised. The agent said there would be an early disconnection charge as I was cancelling “in contract”. Davy disputed this and asked for transcripts of his calls with Sky to prove his case.“The forms I was supposed to sign requesting the transcripts never arrived and I let it slip for a while as I was very busy in work and didn’t have time during the day to be still following this up,” he says.Then in early January “with full direct debits still going out to Sky” he spoke to another agent and went through the story again.Time passed and he contacted Sky again as the transcript request form wanted him to submit £10 (sterling) when returning it. The company confirmed they’d sent out the wrong form and that he shouldn’t have to pay anything and that they would send out a new transcript form in the post.“I finally got the transcripts in the post toward the end of February 2018 but it came in the form of 40 pages of every transaction and call in Excel format, a hard copy of emails sent to me and a CD Rom – hello – who still has a CD player on their laptop in this day and age? I mean Sky can reboot your TV from India so you think they could email me the call recordings? I also had to call Sky again as the form requested €5 this time – I was told that I was misinformed and that there was a €5 fee but if I paid it that Sky would credit me for same.”Again Davy let it slip for a spell as he was very busy in work “and needed to source an old laptopPC with a CD player. But when I finally did source one last weekend, the security ‘passphrase’ they emailed me separately to open the CD did not work. I’ll be contacting them yet again today advising of same, but either way I know I renewed in good faith on the basis that Sky could offer me fibre like eir.”Apart from the efforts to get the transcripts he has also contacted Sky on numerous occasions to cancel his broadband and having been as polite as humanly possible all along, “on one occasion I finally lost it a little when pitted against an alpha male supervisor who had raised the tone of our conversation to a higher level, when I uttered the words \u0027get your head out of your ass for a minute\u0027\u0026nbspit was duly followed by \u0027I’m now terminating this call\u0027. I mean I work in construction and that’s about the least vulgar thing you can say to someone in conversation,” he says.“On another occasion I was told I could only cancel Sky exactly a month before the renewal date and not before. So I did ring Sky on 25th April 2018, someone in the Cancellation Department listened to my summary of the whole fiasco and confirmed that she’d process the cancellation herself, do a follow-up on the 14th May 2018 to make sure it went through and also confirmed when I asked the question that \u0027nothing can go wrong\u0027\u0026nbspwith it this time”.“He did call back 10 minutes later and promised to sort things out within the Cancellation Department and call me back later that day. I haven’t heard anything from anyone in Sky since and am beginning to think that this is some kind of sick game that the Sky Cancellation Department play on people or maybe it’s just with me.”He says what he would like is the cancellation of his broadband, a refund of his money, and “an official apology from Sky to acknowledge that you can’t treat people like this and you can’t continually give them misinformation depending on what operator they’re talking to”.He also said he would like “compensation for the wasted hours on the phone where you’ve got to psych yourself up to make the call in the first place, go through their voice recorded options, utter the words “Cancel Broadband” for the umpteenth time when they ask you to clearly describe how they can help you today, relay your life story to another poor unfortunate Sky operator who you know sympathises with you but are only doing their job and probably have another 10 or 20 Paul Davys to listen to after your call finishes”.We got in touch with the company and received the following statement.“Having investigated the case highlighted we wish to apologise to the affected customer. We pride ourselves on providing customers with a high standard of customer service and acknowledge that the customer’s experience in this instance did not meet those standards. We have reached out to the customer and have resolved this matter.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dublin s pride parade wows the city as thousands take to the streets","story":"  June 30, 2018This year\u0026rsquos event marks 25 years since the decriminalisation of homosexuality   June 30, 2018LGBTI+ activists express concerns that the event is now more of a festival than a protest   July 2, 2018None more gloriously cynical about creeping commercialisation than LGBT+ community "},{"url":null,"title":"ireland s hosepipe ban everything you need to know","story":"Irish Water have introduced a hosepipe ban in the Greater Dublin Region. What does that mean? What is covered? How long will it last? And how will it be enforced?The month-long ban was introduced on Monday, to last until at least July 31st, at which point it may be extended.The ban prohibits people using their garden hose, with a few minor exceptions. People will not be allowed to use a hosepipe to water their garden or potted plants, wash their car or boat, or fill a paddling pool, pond, or water fountain.People can still water their garden and plants using a watering can, and fill a paddling pool with buckets of water filled from the tap. The hosepipe ban on filling ponds does not apply if there is fish in the garden pond. The ban is in place 247 for the next month.At the moment the hosepipe ban is only in place across the wider Dublin region. Irish Water has included as parts of counties Wicklow and Kildare in the Greater Dublin Region area ban.It said there are more than 100 other areas across the country at risk of water shortages, where it is considering a hosepipe ban to conserve supply.Decisions to extend the ban to other areas are likely, but will be considered on a scheme by scheme basis. In the meantime night time water restrictions are in place across several parts of the country, to help conserve supply.In the south of the country 27 local water schemes have been severely affected by drought, including parts of Kilkenny, Carlow, Waterford, Limerick and Kerry.People can report their neighbours or anyone they see breaking the ban. A tip line to report excessive water use is available at 1850 278 278.The water utility said they have added additional staff to man the phone line over the next month. The phone line can also be used to ask staff general water conservation queries.A spokeswoman from Irish Water said staff would follow up on reports, and take actions where they found “excessive and continuous usage” of water.If Irish Water deem someone has committed an offence in breaching the conservation order, they can be fined €125, and prosecuted if they do not pay within 21 days.Legislation allowing Irish Water to introduce a hosepipe ban is covered under the Water Services Act 2000, which gives the utility the power in cases of “serious deficiency” of water supply.Irish Water have introduced the restrictions in Dublin as demand for water is outstripping how much the utility can supply.The greater Dublin water schemes can produce 610 million litres of treated water a day. Currently nearly all of that is being used, since the heatwave started.This is compared to an average 565m litres a day used over the summer last year.During the peak of the heatwave in the second half of last week, up to 615m litres a day was being drawn down in Dublin.The exceptionally high temperatures over the last week have also led to dropping water levels in lakes and rivers, and the dry weather has also meant a lack of rain.Water reserves are being stretched to the limit, with the Pollaphuca reservoir on the Liffey being drained so quickly it may have knock on effects for water supply later in the summer, and even into the autumn, Irish Water have said.At the moment the conservation order is in place for the month on July. A spokeswoman for Irish Water said they will “continue to monitor all water supplies and will provide updates if any extension is required.”“We have a collective community responsibility for the conservation of water, as they do in other countries when a hosepipe ban is in place,” the spokeswoman said.Irish Water have also called on people to take steps to conserve the amount of water they use generally.People are being asked to take showers instead of baths, and to take shorter showers. Turn off the tap when brushing your teeth, and only run the dishwasher and washing machine on full loads.If watering your plants with a watering can, Irish Water said people should do so in the early morning or evening, to limit evaporation.When it comes to flushing the toilet, Irish Water’s conservation advice is to “let the yellow mellow,” as flushing the toilet is one of the biggest uses of water in the household. People are being asked to “consider only flushing the toilet when you really need to,” the utility have said.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550407.1530473106!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish water urges public to report those disobeying hosepipe ban","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA month-long ban on the watering of gardens, washing cars or boats, and filling pools from public water supplies, using a hose, comes into force in the capital on Monday.

It was likely that similar orders would be implemented in other parts of the country in the coming weeks, it said.The primary purpose of these orders was to “mobilise maximum public support” for water conservation, it said.“Irish Water is backing up these orders by increasing the number of call centre agents to take calls from the public and we will follow up such reports.”People who wish to report incidents of excessive water use should contact Irish Water on 1850 278 278.A spokeswoman said the utility would follow up the report, but would only take action where they did not receive a positive response from the householder in question or there was “excessive and continuous usage” or water.If Irish Water decides to take enforcement action, a notice will be served on the person alleged to have breached the order giving them 21 days to pay a sum of €125. If this sum is paid, then a prosecution will not be taken.“Irish Water does not want to take people to court, but will have to review its options in the case of a persistent breach of the order combined with a refusal to pay the on-the-spot fine, ” it said.“We expect that most people will be ‘law abiding’ and that the order will be adhered to by the vast majority of the public. We will act in cases where there is excessive and continuous usage, but we would hope that this will be in only a small number of cases.”Irish Water can produce 610 million litres of water per day to serve the Dublin area.Last summer, an average of 565 million litres of water per day was used. Demand shot up to 615 million litres in the middle of last week but moderated in recent days to 582 million litres.Irish Water said some of the fall was down to businesses being closed and households being away over the weekend.“Usage remains well above normal for the capital. We are appealing to the public and business owners as they return to work tomorrow to continue to conserve water to protect water levels in our reservoirs,” it said.“While Irish Water can currently produce up to 610 million litres per day, at these levels all headroom is exhausted and the sources, particularly Pollaphuca reservoir on the Liffey is being drawn down at a rate that puts supplies at risk later in the summer and into the autumn.”A total of 120 water schemes across the country are at risk from drought and could face hosepipe bans. Night-time water restrictions are in place in 39 areas, and tankers are redistributing water around reservoirs.Both rural and urban areas are at risk of drought , Irish Water said.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550184.1530459659!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"just three nurses recruited this year for hse relocation package","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAccording to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, there were 15 nurses recruited last year, down from 82 in 2016 and 20 in 2015. Photograph:  Frank MillerJust three nurses have been recruited so far this year as part of the HSE’s relocation package.The “Bring them Home” campaign was put in place by the HSE in July 2015, offering Irish nurses working in Britain a relocation grant of €1,500 to return to the Irish public health service.Since April 2017, an additional €1,500 is paid after a period of 12 months employment and subject to a commitment to remain in that employment for a further year. Last year, it was decided to extend the package beyond Britain to include nurses from any overseas location.There were 15 nurses recruited last year, down from 82 in 2016 and 20 in 2015, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.The HSE said upon its announcement three years ago it was hoping to attract up to 500 staff under the initiative.Irish Midwives and Nurses Organisation general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha said that while it was important to have packages to incentivise Irish nurses to come back, the current offering was insufficient.“The figures demonstrate that it doesn’t go far enough, it has to be much higher. In addition, the incentive to stay also has to be included,” she said.“What we found is some who availed of the first part of the incentive left after six months. Recruitment is only one part of the story – retention is an even bigger part. The rate of pay is too low within a global market where you can get better rates.”The HSE said it could not provide a comment on the figures at this time but pointed to the health service employment report published last May, which showed a 4.6 per cent increase in the number of nurses employed over the previous year, from 36,474 to 38,139."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550847.1530514505!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bono pays tribute to varadkar and coveney at new york concert","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tU2 on stage at Madison Square Garden in New York. Photograph: Ross StewartU2 frontman Bono paid tribute on Sunday night to the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney for their “very hard work” in protecting “our borderless island”.Speaking from the stage at the band’s concert at Madison Square Garden in New York, the singer recognised the attendance of Mr Varadkar and Mr Coveney and their work on seeking a solution to avoid a hard border in Ireland after the UK leaves the EU.The band lent their support to the Government’s campaign being formally launched on Monday to win a seat on the United Nations Security Council by inviting UN ambassadors from the 193 nation states to the concert. About 150 ambassadors attended the gig on the eve of the Government’s event that will kickstart a two-year campaign to try to win the Security Council seat for the 2021-22 term.“We are proud of the island of Ireland,” Bono told the crowd on the band’s second-last date of the US leg of their Experience \u0026amp Innocence tour.“They work very hard to protect our borderless island,” he added, referring to Mr Varadkar and Mr Coveney. “Are we up for a borderless island here?” he asked the crowd, to shouts of no. The U2 singer also paid tribute to former Irish president Mary Robinson who was also in attendance at the concert for her work in the Northern Irish peace process. Mrs Robinson with Bono will help the Taoiseach and Tánaiste launch the campaign on Monday. The Government hopes the high-profile support will help the campaign to take one of the 10 non-permanent seats on the security council, the most powerful body at the UN, over competition from Norway and Canada. Speaking on stage last night, Bono applauded the UN’s peacekeeping work saying that the world has “watched those blue hats put themselves in harm’s way all over the world.”“Tonight we have 150 ambassadors representing the United Nations here tonight we want to thank you for keeping the world more peaceful,” he said. “You do f**k up the traffic here sometimes but that’s okay,” he added, referring to the notorious traffic congestion caused during the UN General Assembly every September.In a call to action, he urged more women and young people to get involved in campaigns, pointing to demonstrations in the US at the Trump administration’s separation of immigrant children from parents at the border with Mexico. There needed to be “less of people like - less older white guys,” he joked.“Seriously though we have got to ersify, we have got to open up. That’s why if the United Nations did not exist, we would have to invent it because it is the one thing that puts peace on our table,” he said, before introducing the band’s song, One. Mr Coveney, speaking earlier to reporters, said the campaign with a “big bang tonight” with the hosting of UN ambassadors by U2 at the concert. “This is really the top table of world decision-making,” the Tánaiste said of the council. He acknowledged that the council’s failure to act in the conflicts in Syria and Yemen showed the body needed to be reformed. “If Ireland isn’t part of that discussion, then we can’t influence it,” he said. Mr Varadkar told a press conference that the Government wanted a seat on the council because it believed in “working together through international organisations to solve some of the world’s problems.”He was not able to provide a figure on how much the campaign would cost but most of the work would be done by politicians and diplomats over the course of the work they would be doing anyway."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550276.1530478945!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"un security council role has earned ireland international respect","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIreland’s 2001-2002 membership of the UN Security Council, dominated by the response to the 911 attacks, was the last time Ireland held one of its 10 non-permanent seats.Richard Ryan, Ireland’s permanent representative at the United Nations, was preparing for the second week of the Irish month-long presidency of the UN Security Council on the afternoon of Sunday, October 7th, 2001, when an urgent call came through from the UN’s situation centre.It was UN secretary-general Kofi Annan telling him US secretary of state Colin Powell had just called to say American and British military forces would precisely two hours from then strike targets in Afghanistan in response to terrorist attacks on the US a month earlier.“And Richard, it’s over to you,” Annan told the veteran Irish diplomat in a slightly softer voice.Here was the ambassador of a small state, through its temporary membership of a global body responsible for maintaining world peace, thrust into a key role: Ryan had to lead the UN’s response to a developing international conflict that, if handled incorrectly, could blow up into something much bigger.Ireland’s 2001-2002 membership of the council, dominated by the response to the 911 attacks, was the last time Ireland held one of its 10 non-permanent seats. It will not be the last if the current Government has its way Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Monday formally launches the Irish campaign for a seat for 2021-2022.The challenge Ryan faced that Sunday afternoon in the residence of the Irish “perm rep” on Manhattan’s Upper East Side 17 years ago is typical of the tasks that come with membership.Article 51 of the UN charter requires any member state that attacks another to report to the presidency of the council and yet Powell’s call was to Annan, not Ryan, as the council’s president.He interpreted this as possibly President George W Bush but certainly vice president Dick Cheney, defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld and fellow hawkish “neocons” choosing not to become “entangled” with the council and particularly two permanent members, China and Russia, who were certain to object.Fearful of the potential civilian casualties heading into the Afghan winter, Ryan wanted the US to engage with the council in order to set up a co-ordinated UN humanitarian response.“We have a job here,” Ryan said he told Annan. “We have to bring them into the council but obviously we are going to have an uphill battle.”Ryan later made his case to John Negroponte, the US ambassador to the UN.“If you don’t take this suggestion seriously, you will be attacked for the famine and all the humanitarian disaster that will be happening and you will not be able to do anything about it because you will be in there on strictly military terms,” Ryan told Negroponte, according to the Irish man’s account.A flurry of phone calls later, after missiles began flying in Afghanistan, Negroponte called Ryan to tell him: “I think Irish diplomacy is beginning to work.” At that, Ryan lined up a call by then minister for foreign affairs Brian Cowen to Powell.The article 51 letters setting out the justification for the action subsequently landed on Ryan’s desk. The US was in. Ryan recognised US diplomats were “putting their heads into the lion’s den, totally against the advice of Cheney and Rumsfeld”.In retrospect, he believes the episode created “a template for the future”. Ryan said Annan told him that he believed “no other country” could have persuaded the Bush administration to engage with the UN but Ireland.Coming to the table saying Ireland had no agenda was key, said Ryan. “Everything was transparent, everything was clear,” he said. “We weren’t upsetting anybody but the system was already working before troops met each other in the field in Afghanistan.”Ireland’s membership of the council – the third occasion since 1961 that the Irish have held a seat, each falling roughly at 20-year intervals – was dominated too by responses to the civil war in Angola and the creation of a new country, East Timor. It put Irish diplomats in the front line of international relations.Critics question the cost and effort required from years of lobbying, including the endless meetings, wining and dining for Ireland in foreign countries, to win the temporary seat.An Irish diplomat once joked there were “no crustaceans left on the sea bed” after the culinary hospitality showered on foreign envoys during the campaign to win a seat 20 years ago.Wesley Boyd, the former  diplomatic correspondent, described the campaign to win a security council seat last year as “an expensive vanity trip”.Brian Cowen, minister at the Department of Foreign Affairs the last time Ireland held the council, rejects the view it is a “bookkeeping exercise” carrying a cost for the Irish purse.“What we derive from this and the standing it brings is not to be underestimated,” he said. “There is a value there that is not on the balance sheet but that is there in terms of the respect for the country and its ability to participate and work to solve problems well beyond our own shores.”Frank Smyth, director of the UN policy unit at the Department of Foreign Affairs, worked at the UN the last time Ireland was on the council. He says membership not just allowed Ireland to develop a higher profile with all 192 other UN member states but helped strengthen bilateral relations with the five permanent council members – the UK, the US, France, China and Russia – at political and official levels.“For many countries, the UN is the forum where they are most likely to see Ireland and form an impression of us,” he said. “By acting fairly throughout our term and by handling the heavy council agenda with competence, Ireland left a legacy which enhanced our national standing more broadly.”Cowen says the experience of serving on the council over the past four decades has allowed successive generations of Irish diplomats to develop skills to operate at the highest level.“It is not simply a question of prestige, although it is a prestigious thing,” he said. “The sort of training and experience it gives our diplomats on the front line of international politics is of huge benefit in the longer term to the department in how it serves the country and the network it builds up.”Ryan says the Irish voice is “particularly listened to” at the UN, and Irish diplomats carved out a reputation of speaking carefully, in a considered way and of being effective, fast-moving and transparent.“We are a small country with a big eye, small but broad-shouldered. We are not afraid to approach difficult delegations and countries.”The 15-member United Nations Security Council is one of the six main organs of the UN and is primarily responsible for maintaining international peace and security.It is the most powerful body in the UN system. Unlike other UN organs, only the council has the power to make decisions that member states are obliged to implement.There are five permanent members of the council: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Ten non-permanent members are elected by the UN General Assembly for two-year terms.RussiaSoviet Union has used its veto powers the most out of the five permanent members of the council. It has used its veto 12 times to shield the government of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, a key ally of the Kremlin, since the country’s civil war began in 2011.The US has begun using its veto again under Donald Trump’s presidency in support of Israel. The British and French have not used their veto powers for almost 30 years.If elected to the council, Ireland would hold the monthly presidency of the council at least once during its term as it is rotated alphabetically among the membership."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550841.1530513588!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"merkel to meet allies in last attempt to avoid rupture","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel leaves after a party leadership meeting at the CDU headquarters in Berlin. Photograph: Omer MessingerAFPGetty ImagesChancellor Angela Merkel will meet her Bavarian allies on Monday afternoon in a last attempt to find agreement on migration policy and avoid rupture in their centre-right alliance after almost seven decades.The stand-off, which threatens Dr Merkel’s fourth-term coalition, escalated on Sunday after an emotional eight-hour crisis meeting of the Christian Social Union (CSU) in Munich.Its leader Horst Seehofer, who is also interior minister in Berlin, offered to stand aside amid CSU disagreement on whether last week’s EU political proposals on asylum seekers were sufficiently strong to avoid German border closures.“I said I would make both positions available in the next three days,” Mr Seehofe said on Monday morning, ahead of final talks with the chancellor. “We want an attempt at agreement in the interests of this government.”In the CSU’s larger sister party, Dr Merkel’s own Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the resignation threats from Munich appear to have solidified support behind the chancellor.“We have done everything to build bridges and we will do everything to ensure the CDUCSU union stays together,” Mr Peter Altmaier said, federal economics minister and a close Merkel ally.But the CSU leader’s resignation threat has darkened further the mood between the two parties, who have shared a parliamentary party in the Bundestag for 69 years.From today Mr Seehofer had vowed to turn back at German borders migrants already refused asylum or registered elsewhere in the EU - unless Dr Merkel could convince European leaders to sign up to “equivalent” measures to reduce asylum numbers.The chancellor returned from last week’s all-night summit agreement convinced she had a deal to appease the CSU, but her hopes of ending her coalition crisis evaporated in a long weekend of closed-door meetings and megaphone diplomacy.“The situation is serious, everyone knows that,” Dr Merkel said in a German television interview on Sunday evening.She repeated a concern of EU leaders that unilateral measures could endanger the Schengen free-travel area and warned her Bavarian allies against “uncoordinated, unilateral measures in Europe at the expense of” other member states.“Europe works slowly,” she said. “I am in favour of Europe remaining together.”Acknowledging her political career hung in the balance, Dr Merkel reportedly told political allies a CSU refusal to accept last week’s summit conclusion would mean “I don’t need to show my face again in Europe”. After an all-night marathon, EU leaders reached political agreement on Friday to step up controls on the EU outer border and bring migrants to central processing camps inside and outside the EU.In addition, Berlin struck bilateral agreements with Greece, Spain and a reported dozen others to send back from Germany asylum seekers already registered there.After conciliatory signals on Friday senior CSU officials said on Sunday that, on closer inspection, the agreement was filled with “contradictory small steps”.The CDU and CSU sister parties have wrestled on Dr Merkel’s liberal refugee policy since Germany accepted over 1.4 million people in 2015 and 2016.Germany has tightened up its asylum procedures since then and new arrivals have fallen dramatically. But political observers suggest the CSU is looking for a symbolic tightening of border rules to salvage its law-and-order profile, and endangered absolute majority, when Bavarians choose a new state parliament in October.If Mr Seehofer - or a successor - goes against Dr Merkel’s wishes she is likely to fire him, triggering a walkout of CSU ministers in the Berlin and a likely rupture of the CDUCSU parliamentary party alliance and Dr Merkel’s coalition.Asked if she would discipline her rebellious coalition partner with a Bundestag confidence motion, Dr Merkel replied: “We’ll see.”On Sunday evening, Dr Merkel appeared to concede her response to the refugee crisis had given a political boost to the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).“Perhaps there is sometimes a yearning for simple answers,” she said,” and that without Merkel there would be no migration problem.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550851.1530515670!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"downing street produces third brexit customs model report","story":"Downing Street has produced a third model for handling for post-Brexit customs ahead of crucial Cabinet talks on Friday, according to reports.British prime minister Theresa May will bring together her Cabinet at Chequers on Friday to thrash out details of a white paper setting out the UK’s plans for areas such as trade.Brexiteers oppose the Ms May’s favoured option of a customs partnership with the EU, which would see the UK collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods entering the country on behalf of the bloc.Their “max fac” alternative would, rather than scrapping customs checks, uses technology to minimise the need for them.Both options have been dismissed by the EU. According to the BBC, No 10 has now produced a third model for handling customs after Brexit which will be discussed by senior ministers at the prime minister’s country residence.Prior to the report, communities secretary James Brokenshire said there was “no doubt that there is strong views on either side” over Brexit in Cabinet, but insisted he was “confident” Ms May’s top team could reach an agreement at the meeting.Mr Brokenshire said the UK government was planning for “all eventualities”.Meanwhile, leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has said Ms May must deliver the Brexit she promised or risk collapsing the government.Mr Rees-Mogg said Ms May and her top team must decide at Chequers if they would stand by her pledges or reduce “a once-proud country” to a “tremulous state that sees Brexit as mere damage limitation”.Writing in the Daily , Mr Rees-Mogg warned Ms May she was in danger of splitting the party like Sir Robert Peel, who plunged it into the political wilderness for nearly three decades following bitter isions over trade reforms.He said: “Theresa May must stand firm for what she herself has promised.“One former Tory leader, Sir Robert Peel, decided to break his manifesto pledge and passed legislation with the majority of his party voting the other way.“This left the Conservatives out of office for 28 years.It comes as Ms May’s chief Brexit official reportedly told ministers they have no chance of striking a bespoke trade deal with Brussels. Briefing Cabinet ministers ahead of the Chequers talks, Oliver Robbins is said to have painted a bleak picture of the situation, with a source telling the Times they came out of the meeting thinking “we were even more screwed than we were before”.Business secretary Greg Clark and commons leader Andrea Leadsom both refused to rule out an extension to transition arrangements in the face of demands from Tory backbenchers for the timetable to be maintained.Mr Clark said the decision must be “guided by the facts and the evidence” and Mrs Leadsom said December 2020 was not a “magical date”.–PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550368.1530470887!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk s business secretary holds out prospect of longer brexit transition","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSecretary of State for Business Greg Clark. Photograph: Will OliverEPABritain’s post-Brexit transition arrangement with the European Union could extend beyond its scheduled limit of December 2020, one of Theresa May’s most senior ministers has suggested. Business secretary Greg Clark said during a visit to the port of Dover that evidence should dictate when Britain moves away from the status quo in terms of alignment with the EU.“At all times we need to be guided by the evidence on this. Speaking to the people that run this very successful port ... in order to make sure that we can continue the success, and that we don’t have frictions, there are things that would need to put in place,” he told Sky News.“Computer systems, for example, posts at the border, even if they checked number plates. What we need to assess is how long it would reasonably take to put in practice, and then it seems to me that any reasonable person would have to be guided by the facts and the evidence.”The cabinet will meet next Friday at the prime minister’s country residence at Chequers, ahead of the publication next week of a white paper outlining the future relationship Britain wants with the EU. More than 30 Eurosceptic Conservative backbenchers have written to Ms May telling her to show “courage and leadership” and to stand firm against calls to compromise with the EU.“Our departure must be absolute,” the letter states. “We must not remain entangled with the EU’s institutions if this restricts our ability to exercise our sovereignty as an independent nation. Anything less will be a weakening of our democracy. Britain must stand firm.”Housing secretary James Brokenshire said on Sunday that he was confident that ministers would unite around a common position at Friday’s meeting. And Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers said that cabinet disunity could lead to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister. “The danger of disunity at the top of the party is not just that it makes the prime minister’s job more difficult in negotiations with Brussels, and therefore puts at risk the good Brexit deal that is in reach,” Mr Brady wrote in the Observer. “It also gives an impression of ision to the country. Electorates these days are volatile, but one thing is certain: they do not vote for ided parties. They rejected decisively the ided Tory party in 1997. If we were to let Labour in again, it would be a disaster for this country.”Mr Corbyn is under pressure from anti-Brexit groups in his party to back calls for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, as a poll showed most members of the Unite union wanted a second vote. Members of Momentum, the grass-roots group that backs Mr Corbyn’s leadership, have also called for a fresh referendum but the Labour leader on Sunday resisted the demand.“We have not proposed it, we have not supported it and we are not proposing it now,” he told Sky News.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Indeed, Mexicans joke that “AMLO”, as he\u0027s known, mayor of Mexico City from 2000 to 2005 and a household name, has been campaigning for the presidency for 18 years.Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador: Mexico\u0026#039s Jeremy Corbyn to battle \u0026#039the mafia of power\u0026#039“It’s a triumph for all the world, all the people,” he told his fans, gathered outside his home in the early hours of Monday. “It’s of millions and millions who are fed up with this regime of corruption and privilege, and who decided today to vote for a real change.“I’m going to do it. I won’t fail you.”Jose Antonio Meade, 49, candidate for the ruling PRI, conceded defeat with lightning speed, announcing shortly after the first exit polls were given, at 8pm in Mexico City, that he had lost.An experienced and well-respected politician, he was severely handicapped by representing the party of despised President Enrique Pena Nieto.Jose Antonio Meade gives a thumbs up after voting on Sunday. He was the first to concede defeatRicardo Anaya, from the conservative PAN, conceded 45 minutes later, saying he had already phoned the winner to wish him well.I recognised his triumph, I congratulated him, and I wished him success, the 39-year-old said.Once his victory became clear supporters streamed towards the Zocalo plaza at the heart of Mexico City, cheering and chanting: It is an honour, to be with Obrador.The plaza was completely full by the time he arrived to give a victory speech in which he underlined his long-time claim that he would head the biggest transformation of Mexico since the 1910 revolution - though he also stressed three times that the transition would be both peaceful and ordered.Nothing to create an economic crisis, he pledged, vowing to respect the independence of the central bank, keep taxation at its current level, and promote business.I will not let you down, he said, to wild cheers from the crowd. We are going to be ruled by three basic principals. No lying, no stealing, and no betrayal of the people. Thousands of supporters of Mr Lopez Obrador crammed into the Zocalo square in Mexico CityA thousand miles to the north, in the border city of Ciudad Juarez – from where he launched his campaign in April - cars were honking their horns as they passed his party’s headquarters, and drivers sped by waving flags, leaning out of their cars and cheering.The long-time friend of Jeremy Corbyn has been the front runner from the start, but has made an extra effort to win over the sceptical northern states. Making his third attempt at taking the presidency, he promised to defeat “the mafia of power” and usher in a new era of corruption-free rule, in which the most marginalised come first.His platform includes promises to sell the presidential jet, slash his presidential salary in two, and turn the presidential palace into a cultural centre. He has campaigned with the pledge of doubling pensions for retirees, increasing scholarships for students, and boosting production and employment in the impoverished south.How he will pay for this remains unclear – his team speak vaguely of corruption reductions freeing up millions of dollars.And he has been remarkably unspecific in his plan for dealing with Mr Trump, Nafta and the surging violence – only talking about rooting out the causes of organised crime, such as poverty and a lack of opportunities among the young, and floating a plan for an amnesty for cartel members.Mr Lopez Obrador in Ciudad Juarez on April 1, to kick off his campaignNevertheless, his message has resonated in a country exhausted by endless corruption scandals and a failure to reduce the incessant violence. As the results were announced in Ciudad Juarez two policemen were shot and injured not far from the headquarters, in another grim sign of the deteriorating security situation which both the PAN and the PRI have failed to calm, and which has driven the city to support Mr Lopez Obrador for the first time.May has been the worst month for murders in the city in seven years, and, dependent on trade with the US, the election has set residents on edge.Mr Lopez Obrador’s candidate for mayor of the city, Javier Gonzalez Mocken, who by midnight on Sunday had a narrow edge over his opponent, told The  his party was going to work on reducing the causes of cartel violence.“Lopez Obrador is looking at the reasons – the poverty and lack of hope,” he said, inside the chaotic party headquarters as the votes came in. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, casting his vote on Sunday morningHe admitted he did not agree the suggested amnesty for cartel members.“In the strict sense of the word, no, I’d not be in favour of that,” he said. “Not if they have killed people. But he’s talking about how lots of people are driving into working for the gangs through lack of opportunity. He talks about scholarships, and universities. That is good for the city.”And he said he was confident Mr Lopez Obrador would establish a working relationship with Mr Trump.He\u0027s a very serious man, he said. Both sides want a deal on Nafta, as businessmen in the US and Mexico are concerned by this uncertainty.We\u0027ve definitely been taken aback by the treatment from Mr Trump - it\u0027s been worse than any other president. We\u0027re concerned by him. So we have elected Mr Lopez Obrador to improve our relations with the US.Mr Pena Nieto addressed the nation on state television, promising to work with Mr Lopez Obrador for a smooth transition.Mr Lopez Obrador will take over on December 1.Please review our commenting policySouth Koreans forced to relax under new overtime rules limiting working week to 52 hoursCheshire Police chief constable was volatile bully who humiliated staff, hearing toldPsychotic killer who attacked new father told police \u0026#39leave him he\u0026#39s dead anyway\u0026#39, inquest hearsBirth of a planet captured for first time as gas giant bigger than Jupiter swirls into existenceAlan Longmuir, co-founder of the Bay City Rollers, dies in hospital after falling ill on holidayMP calls for ban on bouncy castles after death of girl who was thrown \u0026#3920ft by exploding inflatable trampoline\u0026#39Comment: NHS money must be spent wisely, or we will end up with another GosportBody of missing six-year-old girl found on Isle of ButeNorth Korea expands weapons facilities despite US pressure to disarmArsonists lighting wildfires spotted by police helicopter as crews dig trenches to protect threatened homesHow Japan may hold the secret to solving Britain\u0026#39s aging crisis Govia Thameslink will be stripped of rail franchises and forced to give passengers month free if service does not improve within fortnightVolunteers to be infected with powerful strain of flu to make vaccine betterMoorland wildfires started by arsonists will take \u0026#39many days of sweat and effort\u0026#39 to extinguish‘Spiderman’ hero, who rescued boy dangling from balcony, starts first day with Paris fire brigade UK must boost military spending or risk losing special relationship, says US secretary of defenceUK weather: Thunderstorms bring pause to heatwave as Britain to bask in another scorching weekPhilippine mayor on Rodrigo Duterte\u0026#39s \u0026#39narco-list\u0026#39 slain by \u0026#39sniper\u0026#39 during flag-raising ceremony We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/12/24/16/voted-leave-getty.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1875  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/12/24/16/voted-leave-getty.jpg","title":"brexit two years deal uk economy effects city london ashoka mody international monetary fund","story":"Created with Sketch.The message of the Brexit vote - and of similar protest votes in other western democracies since - was that if citizens do not feel economically secure at home, they will reject international commitmentsClick to followThe Independent OnlineBrexit is a done deal - but the social and economic wounds that led to it have not been healedAt the two-year anniversary of the Brexit vote, officials are engaged in fractious debate on the terms of Britain’s exit from the European Union.They are wrestling with several thorny problems, including the fate of the customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.But the political and media focus on the deal to be struck has obscured the real message of British voters. The vote for Brexit was a cry for greater opportunity from those who feel that they and their children are mired in lives that offer little hope. \u0026nbspBrexit is a done deal, and the exact parameters of exit from the European Union will have limited and short-term bearing on the UK’s economic performance.The basic facts are uncontroversial. Britain will trade somewhat less than before, at least until British businesses redirect some of their trade away from the EU to more dynamic Asian and US economies.The expected decline in the extent of international trade will, for a while, reduce Britain’s overall economic welfare. But, as the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik has repeatedly emphasized, citizens’ economic welfare changes only modestly when countries with extensive trade relationships increase or decrease the extent of their international trade.Estimates of large (sometimes very large) costs of Brexit rely on the wildly unreasonable assumption that British productivity will decline precipitously and permanently.True, the UK\u0026nbsphas been growing slower than other advanced economies since the Brexit vote but that slower growth is almost entirely explained by senseless fiscal austerity being pursued by Prime Minister Theresa May’s government while other countries have neutral or even expansionary fiscal policy.There has been much handwringing about the depreciation of the pound triggered by the Brexit vote. Currency depreciation normally makes citizens poorer: they pay more for foreign products and receive reduced prices for their exports. But the UK was running a large (and growing) current account deficit.Put simply, the UK was not richer it was living beyond its means. Prolonged current account deficits would eventually have caused a sharper and, therefore, potentially more disruptive exchange rate depreciation. For now, the depreciation has helped narrow the deficit (precisely by making British exports less expensive for trading partners – stimulating demand for British goods – and making imports dearer for British consumers). Britain is on a more sustainable growth path.Moreover, as I noted at the time, the pound’s depreciation reflected an abrupt decline in “hot money flows” into the UK\u0026nbspThese foreign funds were being used by Russian oligarchs and Indian billionaires to bid up prices of property in London. After the Brexit decision, the rate of rise in London property price increases slowed markedly recently prices have actually dropped.Since the modest trade costs of Brexit are at least partially offset by favourable developments, it is crucial to recognise what is really at stake. The Brexit vote expressed the anxiety of those who felt that their prospects of rising up the income ladder were vanishing. In her October 2016 address to the Tory party conference in Birmingham, Theresa May seemed to understand that the vote was a plea for greater opportunity and fairness. But she seems to have lost track of that insight.As my student Rachel Lurie and I find in ongoing research, those who voted against Brexit were predominantly low-skilled workers stuck in dead-end jobs or unemployed in Britain’s rust-belt areas. As former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the days after the Brexit referendum, unable to face Asian competition, British manufacturing “collapsed,” and industrial towns “hollowed out,” leaving semi-skilled workers “on the wrong side of globalisation.”But rust-belt parents had a deeper reason to worry. They were bequeathing poor education and work opportunities to their children. Thus, not only were they themselves stuck, they also felt powerless to create more opportunities for their children and grandchildren.The children, for their part, are as dispirited as their parents. Commentators commonly point out that young British citizens voted more so than their elders to remain in the EU. This ignores the large numbers who did not vote: these were young citizens typically unemployed in socially dysfunctional urban communities.For example, in Greater London, the voter turnout was 79 percent in affluent Kingston upon Thames borough but only 65 percent in Hackney, where large pockets of deep poverty and alienation persist. The non-vote of the young living in bleak urban areas was as much a sign of hopelessness as the exit vote of older rust-belt citizens.Theresa May’s early reading was right: UK\u0026nbspcitizens were indeed pleading through their vote (and non-vote) for a fair shot at the future. They were urgently calling on British leaders to revitalize decaying industrial areas and bring hope to failing urban communities in which they were trapped.The message of the Brexit vote – and of similar protest votes in other western democracies since – was that if citizens do not feel economically secure at home, they will reject international commitments.That crucial message has been lost amid the frenzied Brexit negotiations. Until it is heard, it will continue to haunt, and be repeated again and again.Ashoka Mody\u0026nbspis Visiting Professor of International Economic Policy at Princeton University and former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund’s European and Research Departments.

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler. What could possibly go wrong?Great music documentaries to watch nowGlastonbury is taking a fallow year but if you’re still craving your Pilton fix, look no further.

Part two takes a closer look at the Seventies - from Zandra Rhodes’ Queen costumes to the DIY punk explosion.Ian Gillan went to see the show with his girlfriend. He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Renters stay in a home for an average of four years but eight in 10 contracts are for a minimum of six or 12 months.Under the proposals, tenants would be able to leave before three years but would have greater protection if they wanted to stay put.UK news in picturesA firefighter carries a water hose past sheep close to scorched moorland as it burns during a moorland fire at Winter Hill, near Rivington,People march in central London to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS.People look at the damage to the outside of a high-rise block in Wellington Way, Mile End, in east London, after a fire broke-out in a 12th floor flat.Prime Minister Theresa May holds up a Belgium football shirt given to her by Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, center left, during a round table meeting at an EU summit in Brussels.

blacklist communists information research department ird","story":"Created with Sketch.In 1949 the man who conceived Big Brother gave a semi-secret government department a list of 38 ‘crypto-communists’\u0026nbspand ‘fellow travellers’ –\u0026nbspa revelation that has given rise to a peculiar revisionism of his legacyClick to followThe Independent OnlineGeorge Orwell’s cooperation with the government’s Information Research Department has led to some on the hard left branding him a ‘reactionary snitch’To many, he came close to being a secular saint.George Orwell, born 115 years ago on Monday, was the writer who challenged the iniquities of imperialism and capitalism, who took a bullet in the throat fighting fascism, and who taught a Western audience about the horrors of Stalinist communism.That he died young, of tuberculosis at the age of 46, in 1950, served only to enhance his posthumous reputation.\u0026nbspHe became, in the words of one astute critic, “the James Dean of the Cold War,\u0026nbspthe John F\u0026nbspKennedy of English letters”.Death may also have saved him from curdling into the kind of bitter, contrarian conservatism that seems to have been the fate awaiting many a one-time youthful socialist.Instead, Orwell is often remembered as a man of “genius”, the “greatest political writer of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury”.The commonly accepted view of the man is encapsulated in the aims of the foundation bearing his name.\u0026nbspThrough the coveted Orwell Prize, the Orwell Foundation seeks “to celebrate honest writing and reporting, to uncover hidden lives, to confront uncomfortable truths, to promote Orwell’s values of integrity, decency and fidelity to truth”.And yet there is one blemish – or complication – in the reputation of St George.It lay hidden until 1996 when Foreign Office file FO 111189 was made public under the 30-year rule.The hitherto secret file revealed that in 1949 the great writer had, via his friend Celia Kirwan, given a semi-secret government propaganda unit called the Information Research Department\u0026nbsp(IRD) what became known as “Orwell’s List”.Orwell effectively handed over to the British authorities the names of 38 public figures whom he thought should be treated with suspicion as secret communists or “fellow travellers” who sympathised with the aims of Stalin’s Russia.When the existence of Orwell’s List was revealed in 1996, and when the Foreign Office finally ulged who was on it in 2003, the initial reactions seemed tinged with sadness and hedged about with qualifications.But the internet was young then.Now it has grown into a giant bristling with social media channels and anger\u0026nbspswift to judge, slow to reflect.And so George Orwell, a hero to so many, is now demonised online as a “fake socialist”, a “reactionary snitch”, a traitor, a McCarthyite “weasel”.“Orwell’s List is a term that should be known by anyone who claims to be a person of the left,” declares one fairly widely circulated condemnation.\u0026nbsp“At the end of his life, he was an outright counter-revolutionary snitch, spying on leftists on behalf of the imperialist British government.”“He was an anti-socialist,” asserts another indictment, “corresponding with British secret services and keeping a blacklist of writers.”So widespread has the vilification become,\u0026nbspthat “Orwell as snitch”\u0026nbspis sometimes played with – not entirely seriously – as an internet meme.“I can’t get very worked up about the list,” he says mildly.\u0026nbsp“I don’t see it particularly as a mistake. \u0026nbsp“You just have to see it in the context of the time.”And that context, reveals Taylor, was explained to him by the left wing former Labour leader Michael Foot.Taylor recalls: “Foot told me that the great difficulty if you were a left wing Labour MP in the 1940s was working out exactly where your friends stood.\u0026nbspYou didn’t know whether some were listening to you and agreeing, and then going straight to the British Communist Party’s headquarters in King Street and telling them everything.”“Another example of the kind of thing they were facing,” says Taylor, “was the man who worked in the Foreign Office in the room next to Orwell’s IRD friend Celia.\u0026nbspHis name was Guy Burgess.“There were at least a dozen elected parliamentarians taking their orders from a foreign country,” adds Taylor.\u0026nbsp“What could be more traitorous than that?”Years after Orwell listed him as giving the “strong impression of being some kind of Russian agent”, the Mitrokhin Archive of KGB documents revealed that journalist Peter Smollett had indeed been a Russian agent.Driberg, who was\u0026nbspnamed on Orwell’s List as well as the KGB papers (Getty)Also listed by Orwell, and as a KGB agent by Mitrokhin, was the leading Labour MP Tom Driberg.Laying aside the irony that Michael Foot was himself once falsely accused of being a KGB agent, it is, then, perhaps no coincidence that the IRD was in fact set up, not by a headbanging Tory, but by Labour foreign secretary Ernest Bevin.“This was at a time when the Soviet Union was swallowing up what had previously been independent East European states,” says Taylor. “The IRD was producing reasoned expositions, pamphlet literature, telling people on the ground in Eastern Europe why they should resist this kind of stuff. \u0026nbsp“But a lot of British people were still seduced by the idea of our ally ‘good old Uncle Joe Stalin’, when in fact the bloke was a mass murdering psychopath.\u0026nbspAnd you were also dealing with some really hardline ideologues.“So Orwell’s idea was, if you are going to get somebody to write these kinds of pamphlets, they have to be genuine democrats.“He was a democratic socialist who wanted democratic socialists, not right wingers, to be writing this propaganda.\u0026nbspBut he wanted them to be people who had seen through the Soviet illusion, not covert stooges for Stalin’s Russia.”And so Taylor’s anger – such as it is – is reserved, not for Orwell, but for those like the late Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, who greeted the revelation of the list with the “pathetic” remark: “Orwell was a Big Brother too”.“This wasn’t Orwell denouncing anybody,” says Taylor.\u0026nbsp“He wasn’t writing public articles in the press saying ‘these people are evil’.It should perhaps be noted that Celia Kirwan was a bit more than just a friend.\u0026nbspThree years earlier, Orwell had actually proposed marriage to her in the emotional turmoil that followed the death of his first wife Eileen.Kirwan rebuffed his advances, but some have suggested that Orwell, aware of his failing health, might have been seeking the comfort of a beautiful woman when\u0026nbspon 6 April 1949\u0026nbsphe wrote offering to name those who “should not be trusted as propagandists”. \u0026nbspHe certainly knew the list was not for Kirwan’s eyes only.\u0026nbspAs noted by Timothy Garton Ash, the historian who persuaded the Foreign Office to reveal the document in 2003, Orwell sent his list to Kirwan with a reference to “your friends” who would read it.And as Garton Ash also noted, the IRD did not confine itself to relatively innocuous pamphleteering.In the New York Review of Books article that formed the first detailed analysis of the list’s contents, Garton Ash wrote: “By the late 1950s, IRD had a reputation as ‘the dirty tricks department’ of the Foreign Office, indulging in character assassination, false telegrams, putting itching powder on lavatory seats\u0026nbspand other such Cold War pranks”.When he sent his list to Celia Kirwan in 1949, Orwell might not have known that this was the IRD’s direction of travel, but of all people, the author of 1984, who envisaged the Ministry of Truth, should surely have been aware of the possibility.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThat said, as Garton Ash also wrote, not much seemed to have happened to the people on Orwell’s List (apart from missing out on the IRD pamphlet-writing gig).\u0026nbspIt seems their names weren’t even passed to MI5 or MI6.In America, Hollywood actors blacklisted during the McCarthy era\u0026nbsphad their careers and lives ruined.\u0026nbspIn England, Michael Redgrave appeared on Orwell’s List in 1949 and starred in the film adaptation of Orwell’s novel 1984 seven years later.Peter Smollett, named by Orwell as a likely Russian agent, got an OBE.2017 isn’t ‘1984’ – it’s stranger than Orwell imaginedREAR WINDOW: COLD WAR:The British Ministry of PropagandaBig Brother with a high moral senseIn other words, what happened to those on Orwell’s List seems to have borne no comparison to the fate of Big Brother’s fictional victims or the real millions who died in the purges and repression ordered by Stalin.“The list invites us to reflect again on the asymmetry of our attitudes toward\u0026nbspNazism and communism,” wrote Garton Ash, whose own experiences of being spied on by the communist East German Stasi informed his book The File. \u0026nbspWhat if Orwell had given the government a list of closet Nazis, he wondered.\u0026nbsp“Would anyone be objecting?”And in truth, there does seem a certain asymmetry in the online articles of denunciation.Indeed it is hard not to sense the inspiration of Private Eye’s (fictional) veteran class warrior Dave Spart in some of the articles condemning Orwell as “a social democratic traitor collaborating with the capitalist state against revolutionaries trying to create socialism.”“Sure, the USSR did a lot of objectionable things,” says one writer.\u0026nbsp“But … Western imperialist countries commit much more heinous crimes throughout the world every day.”Which is one way to gloss over the Gulag.The 15 best opening lines in literature115 Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen“It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a

The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.A stronger charge against Orwell might be that of antisemitism.\u0026nbspThe private notebooks that formed the basis of the list he sent to the IRD included labels like “Polish Jew”, “English Jew”, and “Jewess”.But Orwell did also devote an entire 1945 essay to discussing how best to combat antisemitism, while having the honesty to admit – and regret – his own occasional lapses into jokes at the expense of Jews.And at the moment, antisemitism might be a problematic charge for some left wingers to level.Taylor, though, is convinced that some amongst “the newly emergent hard left” would secretly love to unleash something against Orwell.And yes, by “newly emergent hard left”, he does mean some Corbynistas.Younger party members, Taylor concedes, might not have the personal memories of the Cold War, still less an instinctive understanding of the context in which Orwell produced his list in 1949.But, he adds: “I am a Labour Party member.\u0026nbspI have been to hear Corbyn speak and noticed how an awful lot of the people there were aged left wingers for whom there had not really been a place in the Labour Party for the last 20 or 30 years.“An awful lot of the hard left these days would pay lip service to Orwell as a beacon of sanity, while secretly having doubts.“There are still a load of extreme lefties out there to whom Orwell is this snivelling little Trotskyite telling them things they don’t want to hear and pointing out things that shouldn’t be pointed out because they get in the way of the revolution.”And to the ideological, Taylor would add the psychological: “Tall poppy syndrome – Orwell is this secular saint, so let’s have a go at him.”This battle over Orwell’s reputation, of course, is more than just a matter of idle literary historical curiosity.Its relevance to the political struggles of today is suggested by the remark of one of the more ferocious online critics.“George Orwell,” he says, “was the first in a long line of Trots-turned-neocons”.It is certainly true that far-right commentators have started trying to co-opt Orwell to their cause, even to the point of suggesting that the man who once chased a fascist across a battlefield with a fixed bayonet would deplore the Antifa movement.This, says Taylor, is pretty much what Orwell feared.“At the time he was giving Celia Kirwan his list, 1984 was about to be published.\u0026nbspOrwell’s great fear was that right wingers would use it as a piece of anti-communist propaganda, and that’s what happened.\u0026nbspImmediately after\u0026nbsp1984 was published, it was used by the CIA as a propaganda tool.“Orwell wrote a very interesting letter to people in the US saying: ‘Look, this is not so much anti-communist as anti-totalitarian.’“He feared what right wingers would do with 1984, but thought it was the price you had to pay for exposing evils like totalitarianism.“And a writer can’t be blamed for how their books are used by people who are determined to twist meaning for malignant ends.”Taylor, though, can’t help wondering whether Orwell would really have been that upset by the comments of “slightly disconnected people” on the far left of the internet.Orwell himself, he points out, never sought secular saint status.\u0026nbspQuite the reverse: “He was very wary of that kind of thing.\u0026nbspIn an essay on Gandhi he effectively says that when people start being referred to as saints there is something very odd about them and it usually ends in disaster.”Instead Taylor has a sneaking suspicion that Orwell might have been rather amused by his online detractors.“People undervalue Orwell’s wry sense of humour,” he says.\u0026nbsp“David Astor, who used to edit the Observer and employed him, told me about the time Orwell came to him saying, ‘You should hear the abuse I have been getting from some of the communist newspapers.’“Orwell said: ‘They call me a fascist octopus.\u0026nbspThey call me a fascist hyena.“Then he paused: ‘They’re very fond of animals’.”\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This is a good couple of weeks now and we are looking at potentially two\u0026nbspor three\u0026nbspmore weeks of a prolonged settled spell.“This week will be a bit of a repeat of last week with lots of hot, dry, sunny weather for pretty much the whole of the UK.”Temperatures are set to reach highs of 30C across the south and\u0026nbspSouth West with warm or hot temperatures across the rest of the country too.Apart from the heat, some thunderstorms are expected in the Channel Islands and possibly parts of the South West on Monday, following on from some downpours that provided a break from the heat on Sunday.Just the odd rain shower has been forecast throughout the month, primarily in the South West.UK news in picturesA firefighter carries a water hose past sheep close to scorched moorland as it burns during a moorland fire at Winter Hill, near Rivington,People march in central London to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS.People look at the damage to the outside of a high-rise block in Wellington Way, Mile End, in east London, after a fire broke-out in a 12th floor flat.Prime Minister Theresa May holds up a Belgium football shirt given to her by Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, center left, during a round table meeting at an EU summit in Brussels.

Just tired of this endless threat and counter threat.“Why don’t we want the best for the UK than for our own ideological cliques? And there are others in this negotiation as far as I’m aware?”The infighting came ahead of the prime minister facing MPs this afternoon, when she delivers a potentially perilous statement on the EU, following last week’s Brussels summit.\u0026nbspHer chief Brexit negotiator, Olly Robbins, is reported to have told ministers there will be no “bespoke” trade deal and Britain must basically pick between the Norway and Canada models.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Why don’t we want the best for the U.K. than for our own ideological cliques?His comments also attracted criticism from respected backbenchers, such as health committee chair Sarah Wollaston and Tory grandee Sir Nicholas Soames, who told his Tory colleague to shut up.It comes as the prime minister\u0026nbspwas due to\u0026nbspgive a statement to MPs on her appearance at the European Council last week.See below for live updatesEU students\u0026nbspenrolling at universities in England in the first academic year after\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspwill pay the same tuition fees as British students, the government has announced.Damian Hinds, the education secretary, has said\u0026nbspEU students starting in autumn 2019 will access the same financial support and will be charged the same for fees during the duration of their degrees.Story here from our education correspondent, Eleanor Busby:\u0026nbspBarack Obama was asked by David Cameron to issue his famous warning that the UK would be at the back of the queue for a trade deal with the US if it left the EU, a former adviser has said.Downing Street insisted at the time that the then-US president was using his own words when he made the comment during a press conference with Mr Cameron in the run-up to the EU referendum in 2016.But there was intense speculation at the time that the remark may have been scripted by Number 10, because the word queue is rarely used by Americans, who tend to prefer the phrase back of the line.Mr Obama\u0027s then-foreign policy speechwriter Ben Rhodes has now revealed that the comment came up during a discussion between the US and UK sides about the implications of Brexit, and said that it was Mr Cameron who suggested the president should repeat it in public.He told Today: We had come here to try to help the Remain campaign and we had a meeting with David Cameron and his team and we were all kind of in violent agreement about the negative consequences of Brexit.And in talking about the press conference they were going to hold together - Cameron and Obama - we were discussing the arguments for the Brexit campaign.And some of the arguments were based on the notion that the United States could just negotiate its own free trade agreement with the UK quickly and we were all agreeing that that was unlikely to happen.And as Obama was saying that, somebody on the British side said: \u0027We\u0027d end up being at the back of the queue,\u0027 and everybody laughed and Obama said \u0027That is exactly right\u0027.Then he was asked: \u0027It would be good if you could repeat that point in the press conference\u0027, and of course he did.Business minister Richard Harrington said on Twitter: I do wish people would \u0026nbspstop putting their own dogma above the good of the country and the party.\u0026nbspWe\u0026nbspshould all support the prime minister and the businesses that employ so many\u0026nbsppeople in good jobs and export so much.\u0026nbspUnite boss Len McCluskey has urged a small but noisy group of backbench Labour malcontents to get behind Jeremy Corbyn.The union leader, who is one of Mr Corbyn\u0027s biggest supporters,\u0026nbspsaid Labour MPs attacking the party leader should put a sock in it.He told Unite\u0027s policy conference in Brighton: The only people being served by the constant disloyal sniping, the feral smearing of our own party and leader, are the Tories.If you disagree with a particular policy, say so. Otherwise, try saying nothing.This wretched Tory Government is reeling and on the ropes. We have to be ready to be rid of them when the opportunity arises.However Mr McCluskey warned the leadership that it must do more to address a weakness in its efforts to reach older working-class voters.He said: There is a broader sense of disconnect between London and the often run-down and ignored industrial areas.Extra seats in London are not going to get Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street. So test every policy against how it is going to play in Walsall and Wakefield, Mansfield and Middlesbrough, Glasgow and Gateshead.Put the necessity of decent secure jobs, skilled work, at the heart of everything. If you\u0027re talking about any policy which cuts against that, it is almost certainly a mistake.A former minister who was sacked from government for calling his secretary sugar tits and asked her to buy sex toys has said he would recruit better next time.\u0026nbspMark Garnier, an ex-trade minister, told BBC\u0027s Sunday Politics that he was annoyed that he lost his job over the incident, which emerged last year at the height of the Westminster sexual harassment scandal.\u0026nbspAsked if he thought it\u0026nbspwas unfair, he said “I do, given the fact that three weeks earlier when I was exonerated by this, I was promised that if I wrote a letter at the time that my job would be secure.“So yes, I do feel slightly annoyed about it.”The MP was later formally cleared by the Cabinet Office of charges that he breached the ministerial code.Downing Street has refused to comment on speculation that Theresa May is considering a third model for customs rules after Brexit. Ms May will bring together her warring cabinet at Chequers, her country retreat, on Friday to agree a way forward.The PM\u0027s official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: There is going to be a lot of speculation between now and Chequers.Some of it might even be true but I\u0027m not going to engage in advance of the away day taking place.Responding to Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0027s comments on Brexit, the spokesman said: Our focus is on delivering the will of the British people.The PM has set out what she wants to achieve - that is to leave the single market, leave the customs union, leave the jurisdiction of the ECJ and be free to sign and implement trade deals around the world.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The Central Bank of Venezuela, which did not immediately respond to request for comment, has not independently released inflation figures in at least a year.\u0026nbspVenezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, has passed blame for the roiled economy onto others, including opposition activists and officials in Washington. At a campaign rally in May, he blamed hyperinflation on criminal mafias.But economists point out that Mr Maduro runs the unorthodox policies they say have pushed the country into economic crisis. The socialist leader has repeatedly refused international aid to Venezuela.It\u0027s internal, Professor Hanke said. Government spending continues to accelerate and the sources of revenue start drying up.The government has defaulted on a majority of their outstanding bonds, which economists estimate add up to about $60 billion (£45 million). Foreign exchange reserves have fallen by about $2.5 billion ($1.9 million) in the last three months, according to analysis by Capital Economics.\u0026nbspAs state-run oil industry PDVSA falls apart, economists say a rise in global oil prices is adding to the pain. Brent crude oil is up more than 64 percent this year. And as President Donald Trump cracks down on Iran via zero-tolerance oil sanctions, the international benchmark has rallied more than 8 percent\u0026nbspthis week.Production at PDVSA\u0026nbsp- which accounts for 95 percent of export earnings in the country and a quarter of gross domestic product - was cut in half from January 2016 to January 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration. And as the crisis deepens, operations are continuing to wane.Those conditions, Professor Hanke said, have all but killed investor sentiment.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s an expectation part of it, too, Professor Hanke added. Everyone who has a bolivar wants to get rid of it like a hot potato because they expect it\u0027s not going to be worth anything tomorrow.The International Monetary Fund estimated in January that Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate could rise as high as 13,000 percent for all of 2018. Professor Hanke was unsurprised by the discrepancy, saying no one can accurately forecast the course or the duration of a hyperinflation.In pictures: The crisis in VenezuelaA girl scavanges for food in the streets of CaracasA man scavenges for food next to girls in the streets of Caracas.

A recent university study found that about 90 percent of civilians were living in poverty last year and most of those surveyed had lost an average of 25 pounds in body weight.\u0026nbspThe hyperinflation is devastating the economy, said Andres Abadia, a senior economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He expects the economy to contract in 2018, for a fifth consecutive year, and sees no turnaround in the near-term.Mr Abadia said Venezuela is a disaster area and that as long as Mr Maduro is in power, the economy will continue to collapse. But Mr Maduro reaffirmed his\u0026nbsptight grip on power last month, easily winning\u0026nbspanother six-year term in what was widely condemned as a fraudulent election.\u0026nbspMr Maduro tripled wages earlier in June to 3 million bolivars per month, which Reuters reported at the time was equal to just more than a dollar at the black-market exchange rate.When asked if the wage increase might improve living conditions in Venezuela, Professor Hanke replied: No, it\u0027s a joke.

That was exactly what the meeting had been about, and everybody there knew it.The summit was Operation Save Mutti. Their mission: To stop Merkel’s government collapsing by thrashing out a tough stance on immigration to calm her critics. It’s quite a turnaround.Once, Merkel, with her open-door refugee policy, was queen of Europe. Now she’s a beggar. Suddenly, European politics has changed beyond recognition.The tide has turned. Those making the case for an open Europe are haunted and chastised. They are losing elections.Italy’s new coalition of left and right-wing populists is a fiesta of political contradictions, but they share one goal: To stop the migration population from growing.They want a European refugee policy that is pretty similar to what Austria is advocating.Sebastian Kurz, Austria’s young and energetic Chancellor, has begun to talk about “an axis of the willing” between his country, Italy and Germany.He has canvassed allies in Germany for his ideas on migration reform.Many in Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) are tired of her and her centrist style of leadership and see Kurz as their hero.Earlier this month he staged a press conference with Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s interior minister, coalition partner and chairman of the Christian Social Union (CSU) party.Seehofer now wants Germany to turn away migrants who do not have documents or who first applied for asylum in another EU country. Merkel has refused. If the decades-old CDU-CSU alliance ends over this issue, Merkel’s government would collapse.Until recently, it was assumed that Merkel would last until the next elections in three years’ time.Now many are betting she won’t even make it through the summer.There are two kinds of European solidarity now: The Merkel type and the Kurz type.To survive, Merkel must find a way to reconcile the two, but she is perhaps the only leader in Europe who thinks that is still possible.Countries to the north, south and east of Germany have already moved away from her refugee vision.Denmark and Sweden reinstated border controls in 2015.Viktor Orban, in Hungary, and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, in Poland — often dismissed as loonies and fruitcakes — feel that their views on immigration have been vindicated, not just at home but across Europe. And why shouldn’t they?Much as their migration policies are flawed, they are winning the battle of ideas over border controls and openness.They have many new allies in European capitals. Slovakia and the Czech Republic now have leaders who complain about Muslim immigration.And yes, Emmanuel Macron’s victory was astonishing — but a third of France still voted for right-winger Marine Le Pen.Merkel’s view of Europe was the consensus. When Macron took power, it was hoped Europe would be purged of grubby thoughts about migrants.Merkel’s case for a common European policy on refugees seemed likely to win.But the elections in Italy and Austria changed all that. Having populists in former Soviet bloc states is one thing. Having them running Western European states is quite another.The balance of power keeps changing, shifting ever further from Merkel.The incoming Slovenian PM, Janez Jansa, is a migration hardliner and, like others in the Balkan region, sees Europe’s political future as being represented by Budapest rather than Berlin.So what to do? Merkel now stands as the charity case, not the powerbroker.Macron offers her some respite, saying he will help her by taking back the few asylum seekers in Germany who registered first in France.But far more refugees will have registered first in Italy, and the odds on its new government taking them are slim. In Austria, Kurz is focusing on a plan to force refugees to apply for asylum before they enter the EU.When Austria assumes the EU’s rotating presidency next month, Kurz will make this a centrepiece of his agenda. Kurz’s stance is unacceptable to Merkel. Belgium and the Netherlands are also protesting because they fear that forcing migrants to apply from overseas centres will lead to inhumane migration detention camps, as seen in Australia.But can Merkel fight against it?If she wants to stay in power she will need to be wary of those in her own CDU ranks who are closer to Seehofer.If her leadership recently took them to their worst election results since 1949, what might await them after more years of Merkel in power?Whatever she now chooses to do will cause her reputation to crumble.If she fires Seehofer, it may be the end of the German centre-right as the party in charge.If she goes along with Austrian and Italian demands to turn back migrants, she will be admitting that her open-door policy on migration killed her own vision of a welcoming Europe.She has run out of good options, as well as political authority. She may limp on in Germany for a few more years, but her long reign in Europe has ended.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Since then Johnny has seen his life spiral out of control.He admits to struggling with drugs and depression and he’s lost much of his £459million fortune.He’s embroiled in court battles over money and was pictured recently looking incredibly thin and pale.When I interviewed him at the end of last year he was clearly “well refreshed” and virtually incoherent.Maybe having to face up to his child’s health problems could actually be a turning point for Johnny.His family need him right now and he will have to step up to the mark. ONE of the feel-good ­stories of the week was the kind students who raised enough money to send Bristol University cleaner Herman Gordon to visit his family in Jamaica.Herman was beside himself with happiness and cried tears of joy when he opened his gift envelope to find it stuffed with cash for the trip.He’s clearly a very ­special man and much loved by the students, who said he brightened their lives and they simply wanted to give him ­something in return.Herman was part of the Windrush generation and can’t afford to go back to Jamaica too often.But now he and his wife can have a wonderful visit.This little shaft of light gives me hope for the future and shows there is still a lot of decency in the world.Herman also now knows that he makes a real difference and is greatly valued – and you cannot put a price on that. A HUGE thank you to everyone at Edinburgh Napier University, which presented me with an honorary arts doctorate this week.It was so moving to see all the young, hard-working students come up on stage at the Usher Hall to receive their degrees in front of beaming parents, family and friends.Two years ago I saw my daughter Rosie awarded her honours degree in journalism on the very same stage.I was so proud of her I could have burst.It was lovely to be able to follow in her footsteps and it really was a day to remember.  DESPITE not having watched a frame of Love Island, I’m obviously well aware of the show that has divided the nation.But what really strikes me is how similar they all look in the promos and newspaper photos.It’s no wonder the girls bounce from one chap to another when they are merely identical hairless Ken dolls.The same goes for most of the girls. The hair colour and bikinis might be a different hue, but they have that heavily browned, slightly startled, puffy-mouthed look of a sex doll.Which I suppose is the point.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last October, this column urged Mrs May to get the Cabinet to Chequers and not let them leave until they had agreed on the final deal with the EU they should be aiming for.This delay in setting out what the UK wants is one of the many mistakes that have handed the initiative in these negotiations to the EU.In an attempt to prevent any walkouts at Chequers, the Prime Minister will spend the next few days seeing senior ministers individually. “She’s peeling off people one by one,” I’m told.But I understand there has still not yet been a “model that has been selected to go forward for adjudication by the Cabinet”. I am told the approach at the meeting will be “to rule things out rather than rule things in”.Cabinet Brexiteers, though, are already nervous about getting bounced — of being presented with a done deal they will have to either accept or resign over.One of those co-ordinating the Brexiteer response tells me: “She’ll have to show her hand before Chequers. The idea of bouncing people with papers they haven’t seen is completely unrealistic as to where we are.It might have been possible six months ago, it is not possible now.”Brexiteers are worried about Downing Street’s direction of travel.One tells me: “They’re prepared to give away things, but they don’t understand what they are giving away.”The expectation is that the Government will essentially propose staying in the single market for goods.But what won’t be addressed is what this means for immigration.The EU will — at least initially — demand free movement in exchange for the UK staying in the single market for goods.I understand the current plan is for the white paper to say the UK acknowledges that labour mobility deals normally go alongside trade deals. But there won’t be much more detail than that.Sajid Javid, the new Home Secretary, takes the view that the Government shouldn’t put immigration on the table in these talks until it knows what it wants.He is also of the view that if the EU want a deal on immigration then they should have to ask for it.As a former banker, with experience of commercial negotiations, he — unlike too many people in the Government machine — understands the difference between bid and offer.Among Cabinet ministers there is a growing view that they will all be back at Chequers in September to discuss how much they are prepared to move on immigration.But any attempt to get the UK to allow any EU citizen with a job to come here will encounter resistance.“If you can come if you have a job, that’s basically free movement,” one ally of Brexit Secretary David Davis tells me.Getting the Cabinet to agree at Chequers, though, is only the first challenge for Mrs May.The next — and even more difficult one — is to get the EU to engage with what she is proposing. CONCERNS are mounting in Whitehall about the Nato summit, and what Donald Trump might say and do.Compounding the issue is that Trump will go straight from the summit to a dinner in Britain to mark the start of his visit here – meaning Theresa May won’t be able to avoid having to say what she thinks of his comments.One well-placed Government source insists to me that the Trump/May relationship is better than it is portrayed.But this source admits his telephone manner can be rather surprising.I am told that, in reference to Brexit, he regularly starts their conversations with: “Are you out yet?Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin. She must stress that lives are at stake. That the West’s security has relied on Nato for 70 years.And that it would be a disaster for the President to undermine it now, with Russia an increasing global menace.THE restoration work at the House of Commons has hit a snag.Some of the oil paintings, which need to be moved, are too big to go through the doors of the rooms they are in.This means that the oil will need to be rehydrated, a complex process, before the canvases are rolled up so they can be moved.This is another reminder of how difficult it will be to do these restoration works without going way over budget. MICHAEL GOVE has ripped up Theresa May’s plan for a new customs partnership with the EU.To the surprise of officials present, Gove tore the document in two at a meeting on Wednesday.After the Brexit inner Cabinet couldn’t reach a consensus on what customs relationship to have with the EU after Brexit, it was split into working groups to look at the two options.Gove was looking at the new customs partnership, which is Theresa May’s preferred model and would see the UK collecting tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Nearly all Brexiteers, including Gove, see this model as bureaucratic, unworkable and fear it will make Britain a far less attractive country to do a trade deal with.Gove and Liam Fox, the two Brexiteers on the three-man working group, had made these points repeatedly in the six weeks of meetings they have had on the subject.But on Wednesday night, when they were presented with the civil service summary of their discussions, they found these points had been downplayed to almost nothing.Instead, the document implied the group thought the new customs partnership was workable.Gove was livid about this and physically ripped it up to show he wasn’t prepared to accept the document as a summary of their discussions.This flash of anger shows that Downing Street would be making a very big mistake if it assumed Gove will accept – and sell to fellow Brexiteers – any deal with the EU, no matter how flawed it is and how much it tied the UK’s hands for the future.Customs will be one of the biggest bones of contention at Chequers.I understand there is talk the model favoured by Brexiteers MaxFax might be altered to include tariff alignment with the EU.But if that’s the case, then Britain WON’T be able to have a proper, independent trade policy.One of the Brexiteers close to the discussions warns this is the “breaking point of what people are prepared to accept”. THERESA MAY is making it clear to everyone in government that she intends to stay on as Prime Minister after Brexit day, March 30, 2019.Yesterday afternoon, Downing Street summoned the Government’s political advisers and told them to start working on measures to be included in the next Queen’s Speech, to take place in spring and after Brexit day.A Downing Street source tells me: “As you would expect, the Government is focusing on a comprehensive programme of domestic legislation for the next session of Parliament.This will include new plans for the country’s future outside the European Union.”This Queen’s Speech will be huge for Mrs May.It will be her last best chance to show her party she has a domestic agenda that justifies her staying on as Prime Minister.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To which the EU’s Michel Barnier will inevitably reply: “No. It’s full single market membership, including free movement of migrants, or nothing.”Then what? What else has No10 got?There are red lines Theresa May must not cross: free movement, independent trade deals, our courts’ supremacy. She won’t survive conceding on any of them.We weep for Downing Street’s tactics.They seem ­terrified that the PM might have to walk out of talks. Why? If the EU continues to demand everything on its terms, she must do exactly that.They’ll call back.GOBBY Irish PM Leo Varadkar has no idea how much damage he does with every Brexit utterance.His latest salvo revealed a patronising, pompous arrogance as misplaced as it was sickening.The mighty EU won’t change its rules for little Britain, Varadkar sneered.“We’re 27 member states — the UK is one country,” he said. “We’re 500million people, the UK is 60million. That basic fact has to be understood.”The Sun has some more basic facts:Ireland’s population is 4.8million. The UK’s is 66.5million.Ireland’s economy relies on us so heavily that a “no deal” is forecast to throw 2.5 per cent of its workforce on the dole. It is far more exposed than any other EU country, or the UK.Our billions bailed out broke Ireland in 2010. Has Varadkar forgotten?Is he happy to sour relations with millions of UK customers with long memories, who may take against Irish goods?A wiser man would have acted as peacemaker, constructively helping both sides forge a historic deal in all our interests, including those of his country and its wonderful people.Instead he chose another role . . . as the snivelling suck-up egging on the playground bullies.THERESA May must seize her crucial opportunity to save Nato next month.Donald Trump is rightly berating Europe’s major powers for failing, unlike Britain, to fund their defence. But Nato is not some unfavourable trade deal he can abandon at a stroke.Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin.

They must also achieve an outcome which allows the UK to take back full control over our laws, our borders and our money.Any wavering or compromise that keeps Britain as a cash cow for Europe, and our people and businesses subjugated to EU laws that hurt our interests, would be a spectacular own goal.Instead of pandering to those who want to keep Britain in the EU, the Single Market and Customs Union, the team at Chequers must now stand firm and not back down.Their strategy and game plan must be to stand up to the EU and stop letting their negotiating team walk all over us.So far we have been negotiating with the EU in good faith and we have conceded too much ground for little in return.We have pledged a divorce settlement totalling £40billion and while we have advanced a package to ensure that the rights of EU citizens currently in the UK are protected, the rest of the EU have made alarmingly little progress on protecting the rights of British citizens living elsewhere in the EU.Conceding further ground to the EU now will leave Britain exposed at the back and will let the greedy undemocratic EU leaders take advantage of our open goal.The country also decided to take Britain on a new path to future prosperity.Outside of the EU the world is growing at a fast pace.Expanding consumer markets present new opportunities for exciting trade and investment partnerships. Technological change and innovation happens worldwide and the EU’s place in the global economy is falling fast.Ministers must not allow Britain to slip in the world trade league by being chained in any way to Brussels as the EU sinks.Without the straitjacket of EU rules Britain will stand out as a strong place for businesses to invest.While an out-of-touch elite who want to keep Britain in the EU continue to spread fear and doom and gloom, in the real world our economy is doing well.We have some great foundations and since the referendum Britain has seen a surge in foreign direct investment to record levels which shows the high degree of confidence investors have in Britain.They see that outside of the EU Britain will be successful and everyone in the Cabinet should stop playing defensively and commit to that vision too.We are at a crucial moment in our history and Cabinet members need to understand the magnitude of the decisions   they are making.Now is not the time for grandstanding or for egos to get in the way. Ministers need to tighten ranks and play as a united team to achieve victory.The future of our country is far too important to leave to chance and if the Cabinet gets its act together this week then we will be in control of our own destiny.In years to come, people will look back at the decisions we make today and judge members of this Government on whether they have advanced the cause of freedom, prosperity and democracy with a well-executed match- winning plan . . . or left our country to the fate and uncertainty of a penalty shoot-out.Priti Patel is a Conservative MP, representing  Witham in Essex. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Way better, in fact, without wanting to sling mud, than many other commentators who — regardless of their gender — can barely string two words together.Because, of course, whether or not you are good at your job has got absolutely nothing to do with your gender, right?Until, that is, you are a woman in football, or some other realm that men consider belongs to them.Then, it turns out, it’s a problem. For some men at least.Just to be clear, the idea that football is a “guy thing” is totally outdated. More women watch football in the UK than watch EastEnders (and that’s when there isn’t a World Cup on).And that’s just watching it. I’ll get on to playing it in a minute.Still, Simon Kelner, the former editor of the Independent, wrote in a column this week that women talking about World Cup games “is like getting a netball player to discuss major league basketball”.Then former player Jason Cundy gave his five cents worth, saying that women are unsuited to commentate on football matches because “their voices are too high”.And — although I had to watch it from behind a cushion because I was cringing so much — former Manchester United defender Patrice Evra gave Eni Aluko an actual round of applause for her analysis of one match. . . because he was so surprised that women, you know, know stuff about football too.(Her face when he did so was priceless: Withering look personified.)In case you didn’t know, Eni Aluko has more than 100 caps for England as a player. She also has a first-class degree in law. She is super brainy, bright and articulate — and she knows an awful lot about football.I am full of admiration for her. She is such a strong woman. She is also more than qualified to comment on a football match.Sadly, “more than qualified” is often what women need to be to get ahead in a male world.Eni Aluko is a high-powered lawyer, a professional sportswoman who adds serious value to the commentary of any match.Patrice Evra must know her credentials. But some men, when they feel threatened by a woman, respond by patronising her. They try to put her down. Diminish her. Banish her back into her box.As a woman working in sport I am familiar with this.Lots of men who think women in football are encroaching on “their” territory do the same to me. The number of suggestions I’ve had to get back in the kitchen — and far worse — are too many to count.It doesn’t bother me. But it is tedious and annoying.Men who respond to women in this way can’t quite accept that a new generation of women are coming to the fore and using their voice.They really can’t get their heads around the changes that are happening so quickly — the emergence of women who are using their voice, taking “their” jobs.Luckily, they are a dying breed, these men who want to keep women in the Victorian ages.Plus, it is beginning to dawn on them that we aren’t going back into the box.And they’d better get used to it because it’s not just women commentating on football who are being taken more seriously. It’s women who are playing it too.I’m proud and excited to say that West Ham is one of 11 clubs with new Women’s Super League licences.This really is going to change the face of women’s football.Tier one, the Women’s Super League, starts next year and West Ham is part of that.And the Super League is going to mean a lot more money, professionalism and structure for women in football.So to anyone who is worried about female match commentators all I can say is: Hold on to your hats, boys.REBEKAH Vardy got slammed this week for speaking out about being in Russia.She said that she took the role of supporting her husband – and being there for him before a match – very seriously, saying: “I would be mortified if I was pictured leaving a bar absolutely p***ed, knowing that my husband was going to play one of the biggest games of his life the next day.”Of course, some wasted no time laying into Rebekah’s version of feminism since it included being present for her husband which – according to comments I read – undermines feminist values.I have to say I really disagree.Whoever said that you can’t be a feminist and also stand by your man?I LOVED reading about Christine Lampard, who is pregnant, saying she, “couldn’t care less” about putting on weight as long as everything’s OK inside.In an age when many pregnant women barely look like they are expecting, only to “snap back into shape” within days of giving birth, that’s such a refreshing attitude. I felt the same way and allowed myself to eat what I wanted.I know some women crave chalk and coal when they are pregnant but my craving was for Wagon Wheels.At one point I was on about 12 a day. Those were the days.JOOLS Oliver says that being a stay-at-home mum is ten times harder than Jamie’s job running a multi-million-pound cooking empire.She described her role as “brain numbing” and “hell on earth” and said no one respects her in the household. I’m sure lots of eyes will roll at that idea, but I have to say that I agree.The brief run-in I had with being a stay-at-home mum left me full of nothing but admiration and respect for those women who do it on a daily basis.And it made going back to work feel like a walk in the park.LET’S congratulate New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, for being only the second woman ever to give birth while in such senior office.Some people have questioned whether Jacinda can do the job as a new parent. Would that same question ever be asked of a man?WELL this is exciting. Scientists are apparently closer than ever to inventing an invisibility cloak.I’m sure it’s intended for use by top secret agents intent on saving the world.But all I can think about is what a great accessory it would be for any party at which there are people you don’t fancy talking to.Or for eavesdropping on Apprentice candidates.Or spying on the half-time huddle of any team West Ham is playing.In fact, the possibilities are endless.HONESTLY there is no pleasing some people. The number of moans I have heard this week about people who think it is too hot.Just cast your mind back to the past couple of years when it rained solidly for most of June and July – and count your lucky stars.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

which is unprecedented in its bluntness - has been leaked to The Sun.In it, former US Marine Corps general Jim Mattis says Washington DC is “concerned” that Britain’s military prowess is “at risk of erosion”.With threats around the world spiralling, America now expects the UK to hike its cash to the military to help counter them “beyond what we would expect from allies with only regional interests”.In an ominous threat, the general also makes it very clear that while Britain may want to “remain the US partner of choice”, France is already boosting its defence spending - and is waiting in the wings to replace us.President Trump wants an answer from the UK by the time he arrives in Europe next week for the NATO Summit, Mattis adds.The letter’s revelation today is a deep embarrassment to Theresa May, and plunges her into a fresh political crisis.Defence Secretary Mr Williamson, backbench MPs and British generals have all pleaded with her to hike the MoD’s budget and fill its £20bn blackhole.But the PM is adamantly refusing, alongside Chancellor Philip Hammond.The letter from highly respected General Mattis - nicknamed “Mad Dog” when he was in the Marines -  was sent on June 12, three days after he held talks in London with Mr Williamson while his guest at Trooping the Colour.In the two page letter, General Mattis argues that Britain’s position as a leading world power “has been the credibility of the UK’s armed forces”.But he adds: “I am concerned that your ability to continue to provide this critical military foundation for diplomatic success is at risk of erosion, while together we face a world awash with change”.For the first time in the letter, the senior US politician also gives a firm hint that Washington now wants Britain to go beyond  the NATO minimum of spending 2% of GDP on defence, which the government only just about meets at the moment with the inclusion of pensions.Mattis adds: “A global nation like the UK, with interests and commitments around the world, will require a level of defense (sic) spending beyond what we would expect from allies with only regional interests.“Absent a vibrant military arm, world peace and stability would be at further risk”.Purposely highlighting Paris’s recent pledge to pump an extra £260bn into bolstering its armed forces by 2025, Mattis adds: “As global actors, France and the US have concluded that now is the time to significantly increase our investment in defense.“Other allies are following suit.”And dropping the hint that the Special Relationship is now in peril with France in ther wings, Mattis goes on: “It is in the best interest of both our nations for the UK to remain the US partner of choice.“In that spirit, the UK will need to invest and maintain robust military capability.“It is not for me to tell you how to prioritize your domestic spending priorities, but I hope the UK will soon be able to share with us a clear, and fully funded, forward defense blueprint that will allow me to plan our own future engagement with you from a position of strength and confidence.“In advance of that, the President and I look forward to hearing details of the progress you have made with your Modernizing Defence Programme at the upcoming NATO Summit.”Generals are calling on Mrs May to increase the MoD’s budget to 2.5% of GDP a year, which would see a cash increase of £6bn-£7bn.In comparison, the US spends 3.6% of the biggest GDP in the world on its military.But Mrs May has infuriated Tory backbenchers by repeatedly refusing to commit to maintaining the UK’s status as a Tier One military power, saying only that the UK would be a “leading nation” instead.Former Chief of Defence Staff Lord Houghton warned on Saturday: “US observers have come to realise we are living a lie.“President Trump is not remotely impressed by our national pretension to be America’s greatest ally.”The letter will also be seen as more evidence that Mrs May’s relationship with Donald Trump is under increasing strain.Fears are mounting in Downing Street that the President will use next week’s NATO summit in Brussels to announce a major US drawdown unless more members states step up their military funding.The letter – leaked to The Sun by military sources – has been copied to the Chiefs of the three armed forces, as well as No10, and National Security Advisor Sir Mark Sedwill.Senior Tories last night called on Mrs May to urgently act on  Mr Mattis’s warning.Former  defence minister Mark Francois MP told The Sun: “For many months, the Defence Committee has been arguing that we must increase our defence spending, not least to remain a credible ally of the Unietd States.“This letter is a real wake up call that we need to invest to maintain our leardership in NATO, and I hope the Prime Minsiter takes urgent note.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

or what they coyly refer to as novel weapon technology.“And the files reveal they were desperate to capture this technology - wherever it came from - before the Russians or the Chinese got hold of it first.“Although this was 1997, Russia was still regarded as undefeated enemy with a weapons programme regarded as a threat to the West.”Alien experts claim there have been more than 100,000 recorded UFO sightings worldwide in the past 100-plus years."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000276899927.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may brexit negotiator trade deal jacob rees mogg","story":"Oliver Robbins -

I am so sad. What we woke up to here was just dreadful.“This was a senseless and heartless act by people who robbed us of six beautiful animals. To see these majestic lions so mutilated was just such a pitiful disgrace.A manhunt is underway for the culprits with security company Hi-Risk Unit offering a £15,000 reward for information.Distraught Christa said she was woken in the early hours of Saturday at 4.30am after a police patrol chased a group of suspicious men away from the park perimeter.The contents of a backpack dropped in flight have been identified the clothes inside as belonging to an employee who has since vanished.Christa said “At that stage I did not connect the incident at all with the lions.“It was only when the worker in charge of feeding the lions shouted in shock around 7am when he discovered the remains of the butchered lions in their compounds.“You cannot imagine the gruesomeness of the scene. I had the workers take their bodies and burn the remains that afternoon. It was the saddest day of my life”.Christa said she was convinced it was an insider who killed the two white lions Aslem and Aiden, a brown lion Sussie, lioness Jessie and two lion cubs.She added: “It is so heart breaking as these lions were raised from cubs and bottle fed and then people come and do this to use their bones and claws and teeth for witchcraft.“It is just so sad and I keep asking myself why they have come here and done this”.Limpopo police said they had launched a manhunt for the suspects.A traditional healer from Limpopo said the lion body parts were used to make strong muti - a witchcraft potion to cast spells, which is thought to protect people from illness or make them strong and virile.It is also said to be be used by a person to scare their enemies or protect them from attack or the potions can be made to make a person strong or respected or feared by others.Dr Kelly Marnewick of the Endangered Wildlife Trust said: Mostly it is the claws, heads and teeth of the lions the poachers are after. It is a relatively new occurrence and it is something we are watching closely.It is feared that lion bones are also being used to replace the far rarer tiger bones in South East Asia and are being smuggled out for use in traditional medicines.In April lion park owner Gert Claasens, 48, had three of his lions butchered for heads and claws and three stolen to be butchered later in Petrus Steyn in the Free State.The following month Justin Fernandes, 32, had 3 lions and a rare golden tabby tiger killed by poachers at the Jugomaro Predator Park in Limpopo for their body parts."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000416835987.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"england fan in brussels bar","story":"I was one of just a handful of England followers in the sea of delighted Belgium fans who flocked to the capital’s bars and clubs to cheer on their heroes.They kindly did their best to lift my spirits after Adnan Januzaj scored the game’s only goal.Annabelle Le Roux, 18, said: “It was brave of you to turn up in your England flag.There aren’t many of you around here but you should have a beer and cheer up.”In The Big Game Bar nearby I got the thumbs up for waving my Cross of St George with my new Belgian friends.Alain Revere, 22, said: “It’s okay.We are both through so let’s have some fun.We don’t mind your England flag.” ­Outside, others agreed to pose with my England flag so long as they could wave the Belgian tricolor.A small contingent of brave Brits joined me in nearby Roosters bar.Matt Newman, 30, was on rugby tour with pals at Old Guard RFC from Sevenoaks in Kent.He said: “The atmosphere in Brussels has been great and the Belgians have been very friendly.“We’ve enjoyed watching the game with them even though we lost.”Other Three Lions followers congregated at Churchill’s English pub where they were jokingly cheering for the Belgians hoping for an easier route to the final.One said: “We’re gonna go all the way now.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A picture of the child holding hands with new husband Che Abdul Karim after their wedding widely circulated online was the catalyst for anger in the Muslim majority country. The bridegroom already has two wives and six children aged between five and 18, according to local media reports. His new bride\u0027s impoverished parents are said to have agreed to the marriage on the proviso that she lived with them until she was 16. The groom is a scrap rubber dealer who is comparatively wealthy. On Sunday he defended his actions, claiming that he had not eloped and had married her with permission of her family. I was disappointed with various criticisms and allegations made against me in the social media after I took her as my third wife, he told The Borneo Post .

UNICEF\u0027s representative in Malaysia Marianne Clark-Hattingh said: \u0027It is shocking and unacceptable and not in the best interest of the child. It is a violation of her rights. The minimum legal age for marriage in Malaysia under civil law is 18. However, girls can marry at 16 with the permission of their state\u0027s chief minister, while Islamic law sets a 16-year minimum age for girls and allows even earlier marriages with the permission of the sharia court. The Malaysian government has not record of the wedding and has launched an investigation. It is believed that the ceremony took place in Thailand.  \u0027I was married at 14, it killed my dreams\u0027: Scandal of the illegal child brides being sold to be wed    Paedophile sex gangs could have targeted up to 1000 children in \u0027Britain\u0027s worst known abuse scandal\u0027  \u0027The ministry looks seriously upon underage marriage...

Malaysians also took to social media to express their outrage. By allowing this man to marry her, we just robbed this girl of her childhood. We must end child marriage. If true, this is grotesque, read a Twitter post by user @faizalhamssin, echoing scores of other posts. According to Unicef, child marriage is in decline around the world. However, the charity estimates that 21 per cent of women aged 20 to 24 were married as children. The most number of child brides are in South Asia. Malaysia\u0027s English language newspaper, The Star, reported in 2016 that there were over 9,000 child marriages recorded over the previous five years.

Number 10 insisted at the time that the US President was using his own words when he made the comment, during a press conference with the former PM ahead of the EU referendum .  But there was intense speculation at the time that the remark may have been scripted by Number 10, because the word queue is rarely used by Americans, who tend to prefer the phrase back of the line.  Mr Obama\u0027s then-foreign policy speechwriter Ben Rhodes has now revealed that the comment came up during a discussion between the US and UK sides about the implications of Brexit , and said that it was Mr Cameron who suggested the president should repeat it in public.   But Mr Rhodes stressed that Mr Obama believed that the warning was correct.  Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme, Mr Rhodes said: We had come here to try to help the Remain campaign and we had a meeting with David Cameron and his team and we were all kind of in violent agreement about the negative consequences of Brexit.

In a warning shot to Theresa May, Jim Mattis said he is concerned Britain\u0027s power could be eroded and pointed out France was ploughing cash into the armed forces. It is the latest in a string of leaks from the Ministry of Defence, whose top minister, Tory Gavin Williamson, has been accused of trying to launch a leadership bid. By coincidence, Mr Williamson has also been pushing for more cash to be spent on defence. US defence secretary General Mattis wrote to Mr Williamson ahead of next week\u0027s Nato summit - and a visit by Donald Trump to Britain.  General Mattis said he wanted the UK to remain America\u0027s partner of choice but also said that the French were committed to being global actors alongside the US. But he added: I am concerned that your ability to continue to provide this critical military foundation for diplomatic success is at risk of erosion, while together we face a world awash with change. The letter, leaked to the Sun, was sent on June 12 and will reignite a Whitehall battle over defence funding. The UK is committed to meeting the Nato target of spending 2% of GDP on defence, but the US hinted that it wants Mrs May to commit more money. Gen Mattis said: A global nation like the UK, with interests and commitments around the world, will require a level of defence spending beyond what we would expect from allies with only regional interests. Absent a vibrant military arm, world peace and stability would be at further risk.  Highlighting Emmanuel Macron\u0027s recent pledge to pump an extra \u0026pound260 billion into defence by 2025, Gen Mattis said: As global actors, France and the US have concluded that now is the time to significantly increase our investment in defence. Other allies are following suit. He stressed that it was in the best interest of both our nations for the UK to remain the US partner of choice but in that spirit, the UK will need to invest and maintain robust military capability. In a reference to the Whitehall rows over funding, Gen Mattis added: It is not for me to tell you how to prioritise your domestic spending priorities. But I hope the UK will soon be able to share with us a clear, and fully funded, forward defence blueprint that will allow me to plan our own future engagement with you from a position of strength and confidence.

Anyone from the EU who starts a course in September 2019 will now pay the same \u0026pound9,250-a-year tuition fee as UK students - for their whole degree. Until now, it wasn\u0027t confirmed what EU students would be forced to pay next year. That meant they feared a huge increase in fees. Under UK rules, students from outside the EU pay a vast amount more to study the same courses than those from inside the EU.  Non-medicine courses cost up to \u0026pound23,885 a year at Oxford and \u0026pound30,678 at Cambridge. For those studying medicine it can be as high as \u0026pound70,000 a year. Education Secretary Damian Hinds said he wanted clarity and certainty on the situation for students from the EU looking at applying next year. I want everyone with the talent and potential to be able to take advantage of our world class universities, he said. But there is still no certainty of what fees will be from 2020 - even though EU nationals will still be free to come to Britain under a Brexit \u0027transition period\u0027.

Leave both, and lose \u0026pound\u0026pound\u0026pound, jobs, businesses, exports and all party donors 2.

Some 79% of voters who expressed an opinion want the cruel delicacy – made from force-feeding geese and ducks to artificially fatten their livers - stripped from shelves once the UK quits the bloc. Production is already outlawed in Britain but imports from Belgium and France still arrive on these shores.  Yet there are mounting calls for shipments to be stopped, according to a YouGov poll. Support for a ban climbed by 2% over the past year, the survey of 2,120 adults revealed. And it also found just 9% of Britons ate foie gras in the past 12 months. The majority of those who did consumed it only once or twice in the year. Campaigners are buoyed by hopes the Government will ban imports soon after the UK leaves the EU in March. Farming Minister George Eustice has confirmed such a move is being considered.  Animal Equality executive director Toni Shephard said: “This rise in support for a foie gras import ban unsurprisingly coincides with increased awareness about the invasive force-feeding process behind foiegras. “It is clear that when people know the brutal reality behind this ‘delicacy’, they believe it has no place on our shores. “George Eustice has confirmed that there are no barriers to an import ban under World Trade Organization rules as foie gras production is incompatible with our domestic animal welfare laws. “We would therefore be free to implement an import ban on the day we leave the EU - and we expect nothing less.”  The poll discovered regional variations in how often diners tuck into foie gas. In London, 84% of those quizzed had not eaten foie gras in the past 12 months, compared with 90% or more in the rest of the UK. Yet, awareness of how foie gras is produced was also highest in London and the South at 73% compared with just 62% in the Midlands. Young people were less likely to be aware of how it is produced, with just 46% of those aged 18 and 24 correctly saying how it is made, compared with 76% of those 45 and older.

The government has introduced new measures, ministers boasted, that will protect an extra 10 million UK package holidays a year. There\u0027s just one fact you should know. This isn\u0027t a new law dreamed up by the UK - it\u0027s come directly from the EU. In the small print, not only does the government admit it\u0027s an EU law - it says it\u0027s being introduced with only a light touch to minimise any change.  You won\u0027t find any mention of that fact in the government\u0027s press release. Nor in the claim we\u0027re introducing new rules by the Tory press office.  It\u0027s not the first time, either. A string of EU policies were dusted off, tweaked and launched afresh by the UK government only last summer.  You\u0027d need a sense of humour extraction not to appreciate the irony of this. Just as Britain leaves the EU to free ourselves from its laws, the government is boasting about how those very same laws will help Brits\u0027 lives. So what is today\u0027s policy about, and how has it happened before? Here\u0027s a run-down.  The new law explained  Name: Package Travel Regulations 2018   Date: July 1   Department: Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy  What is it?   The definition of \u0027package holidays\u0027 - which enjoy special refund and compensation protection under the law - is being massively extended.   Millions of people who book breaks online and via mobile, bypassing travel agents, will be protected just like people who walk into a shop.   And money-saving websites that pull together lots of third party deals will now be responsible for the whole holiday if a hotel goes bust - under a new category of agents called linked travel arrangements.  The new rules took effect on July 1, 2018. How was it announced?   Officials issued a press release claiming the government has introduced new measures and didn\u0027t mention the EU. The Tory press office went even further, tweeting an emoji of a palm tree with the words: We are introducing new rules to protect package holidaymakers and save customers tens of millions of pounds. So what\u0027s the EU link?   The government itself says this new law simply enacts the EU\u0027s 2015 Package Travel Directive.  A quick look shows it\u0027s the EU - not Britain - that drew up the plans for equality for online shops, as well as \u0027linked travel arrangements\u0027. And it\u0027s not as if the UK was jumping at the chance to implement it. In fact, the government\u0027s covering note said: Our approach to implementation is light-touch in order to impose minimal additional burdens on business. The government also admitted it\u0027s a maximum harmonisation directive, meaning the UK does not have flexibility to change most of it. One of the only changes was to preserve the current regime, rather than introduce new rules, for airlines that go bust when booked through a \u0027linked travel\u0027 website.   Date: July 19, 2017   Department: Treasury   What is it? Extra charges for paying by credit card were set to be outlawed from January 2018. It would save Brits \u0026pound473million on extra charges for flights, online shopping, gig tickets and more.   How was it announced? The Treasury issued a press release claiming ministers today acted to end these unfair fees and didn\u0027t mention the EU at all.   So what\u0027s the EU link? The Second EU Payment Services Directive was already forcing governments to introduce a ban on certain types of surcharge by January 2018. The government simply decided to extend this ban to all retail payment instruments, its own documents say.  Want to keep up to date with the latest from Westminster? Sign up to our newsletter to receive regular news, expert comment and analysis from our Mirror Politics team.      Date: August 8, 2017   Department: Culture, Media and Sport   What is it? Bodies providing an essential service like airlines, utility firms and the NHS could face fines of up to \u0026pound17million if IT blunders or cyber-hacks lead to service failures.   How was it announced? A press release mentioned it was about how to implement the Network and Information Systems (NIS) Directive from May 2018.   So what\u0027s the EU link? The above Directive is a wide-ranging EU law on improving cyber-security. It says it will be up to EU member states to decide a level of penalties which are effective, proportionate and dissuasive. In other words, the general principle was from the EU and the exact rule drawn up by the government.  3. New protections for your personal data  Date: August 7, 2017   Department: Culture, Media and Sport   What is it? A new Data Protection Bill will bring in a string of measures including the \u0027right to be forgotten\u0027 and making it easier to withdraw consent for the use of personal data.   How was it announced? In a press release with the boastful title Government to strengthen UK data protection law and a small mention of the EU Directive at the bottom.   So what\u0027s the EU link? Many of the measures - including the right to be forgotten and changes to the law on consent - are almost word-for-word what\u0027s already in the EU\u0027s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  And finally... sound familiar?

Then it’s probably time to upgrade your stereo to something with more features and better performance…\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByHolly Thatcher17:29, 28 JUN 2018Updated17:13, 29 JUN 2018Advertorial\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhen you think back to the family car journeys from your childhood, there’s a good chance that many of them were spent listening to the crackle and whine of a sporting event played out on an old-fashioned medium wave radio. Given how much the technology in our homes has advanced, it’s surprising how many of us are still using a last generation radio– particularly as DAB upgrades and wireless connectivity for cars are so affordable. If you think it could be time for an upgrade, here\u0027s some helpful tips for choosing a stereo, and some specific recommendations. Upgrading for sound   Depending on the age of your car, even a modest update could improve the sound. Even if your car came with a digital radio, it might even be worth upgrading to one that supports DAB+ for even better digital quality and more stations. What can your car handle?   Car stereos are usually sold in two sizes: either single or double DIN. As a rule, a double DIN stereo will be able to offer you a bigger screen. It’s far easier to create a stereo that offers built-in navigation in a double DIN socket, and with many modern stereos offering video playback when you’re stationary, it’s useful to have the extra screen size. What to look for in an upgrade   If your car stereo doesn’t have Bluetooth built in, then upgrading will give you access to the music on a Bluetooth-equipped phone. That means you\u0027ll be able to listen to music streamed from Spotify or Apple Music while you drive. Many car stereos have a 3.5mm line-in (headphone jack style), while some now offer USB ports. So even if your phone isn\u0027t Bluetooth enabled, connecting an iPhone, iPod or Android phone will allow you to play music over the USB connection and keep your phone charged at the same time. The Sony MEX-N4200BT offers all of the above and costs just \u0026pound99. There’s even a CD player here for your retro music (so the kids can say, what’s that funny silver circle?). Apple CarPlay and Android Auto   One of the greatest upgrades you can get for your car is to add support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Stereos that use these are designed to make your phone an important part of your entertainment system - they allow you to navigate, communicate and play music, with intelligent voice control via Bluetooth (Siri with Apple CarPlay or voice control with Android Auto). You’ll need a recent phone to use either system. CarPlay works on the iPhone 5 and newer, while you need Android Lollipop (version 5) on your phone to use Android Auto. But not all Android phones support Auto, so be sure to check before buying anything. Some stereos support both CarPlay and Android Auto while some only offer one or the other. Again, it’s wise to check before you buy - Halfords experts can help you choose the right stereo for both your car and phone. Once connected to either system, you’ll be presented with a selection of apps: Google Maps for navigation on Android or Apple Maps on an iPhone. You can also access your music and podcasts through the clear and intuitive interface. Many systems will also give you hands-free calling and voice-activated features like Siri. Touching your phone while driving is now illegal, but upgrading allows you to still use your phone while staying within the law. Being able to change songs using Siri or say “OK, Google, send a message to Mum,” is really great if you’re running late and don’t want to stop to safely use your phone.

Traumatised victim Jamie Clarke, 21, says he has not functioned as a normal person since the Bank Holiday crash shown in dramatic CCTV footage. He was sent flying through the air when John Boyle-Matcham, 23, steered his father\u0027s car into the path of the Gilera Runner 125 scooter.  One witness compared the aftermath of the crash in Watford, Hertfordshire to a war movie with Mr Clarke\u0027s badly injured legs looking like they were severed.   A judge jailed Boyle-Matcham for 13 years after hearing there had been bad blood between the two over a former girlfriend. Mr Clarke was taken by helicopter to St George\u0027s hospital in Tooting, south London where he was kept for two months. He had multiple bouts of surgery and spent two weeks of intensive care where he was treated for brain seizures and fractures. He now walks with a crutch and has limited movement to his right forearm and ankle and is awaiting a final prognosis.  Prosecutor Sean Sullivan told St Albans Crown Court that Mr Clarke was lucky not to have been killed or paralysed. CCTV from cameras at the Imam Hussein Foundation in North Approach, Watford was played to the court during last month\u0027s trial. Mr Clarke told the jury there had been bad feeling between him and Boyle-Matcham. He said: There was a little issue between us over a girl from many years ago. I was with a girl and we split up or were on the way to splitting up. He got in there and I told him to back off. Ever since then, we have stared each other out.  He said that on the morning of August 28 last year, a Bank Holiday Monday, he was riding his scooter when he saw Boyle-Matcham on a push bike on St Albans Road, Watford. He said Boyle-Matcham was quite angry and was waving his arms about. As he was wearing a helmet, he could not hear what he was saying. Later Boyle-Matcham was tipped off that Mr Clarke was at some local shops. At just before 6pm that night he drove the black BMW into Mr Clarke\u0027s silver and grey scooter in North Approach. Another driver, Deborah Graham, said she saw the car veer to the right, adding: I said to myself, \u0027f*** they are going to crash\u0027. The car just hit the moped driver straight bang on. I saw the moped and the driver fly in the air. It was slow motion and they landed on the grass verge.  It looked like his legs had been severed. His trousers looked like they had been pulled down. A leg or both legs were not in a good position. I initially thought they had come away from his body. It was like a war movie. There was a lot of muscle and bone showing. Boyle-Matcham drove off and abandoned the car. He dialled 999 at 8.11pm, about two hours after the crash, and told the police that the bike had pulled out at him and he had panicked. Boyle-Matcham, of St Albans Road, Watford, was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm with intent by a majority of ten to two. He had pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of causing grievous bodily harm. He also admitted failing to stop at the scene of an accident. He had a conviction from May 2016 for driving without due care and attention and failing to report an accident. As a juvenile he received police warnings for theft and having an offensive weapon.  In the witness box, Mr Clarke said he had left a friend\u0027s house in Harris Road and was riding along North Approach to go to Boundary Way, where other friends live. He said he recognised Boyle-Matcham\u0027s car as it came towards him. He said: All of a sudden it swerved into my lane and came towards me. There was not much I could do. It hit me. It was all a blur from there. Boyle-Matcham told the jury: I wanted to scare him. It was a split second foolish thing to do, maybe with the intent to make him fall off at worst or slam his brakes on, but I never intended to hit him.” He said: I just feel so sorry for Jamie for what I have put him through, for what I have put his family through, for what I have put my family through. “It’s probably the worst mistake I have ever made in my life and I’m just sorry.” "},{"url":null,"title":"bullied teenager makes dramatic school","story":"NewsBullied teenager makes dramatic school prom entrance accompanied by 127-strong gang of bikersWARNING, CONTAINS BAD LANGUAGE: Chloe Robson, 16, says she has been bullied and made to feel “worthless” from the age of seven and had been nervous about going to the prom in County Durham\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByLucy Thornton23:02, 1 JUL 2018Updated11:32, 2 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA bullied teenage girl made a dramatic entrance at her school prom when she was escorted by more than 120 bikers.

Luke Stone, 28, was believed to have taken anabolic steroids on and off for around three years to improve his physique, an inquest heard. He sometimes went to the gym three times a day and became \u0027more obsessive\u0027 with his training after his relationship breakup, the hearing was told. The security guard, from Exeter, Devon, developed chest pains and went to A\u0026ampE on March 22, 2017, the inquest at Exeter\u0027s County Hall heard.  Further examinations revealed he had a blood clot of the heart, Devon Live reports.  However, his condition deteriorated and he had a heart attack before also suffering a stroke the following day. A blood clot was found on his brain and he passed away on April 5 last year.  Following the inquest, Luke\u0027s family spoke out to urge other steroid users to be aware of the danger of taking unprescribed drugs. His father Eric said: “I hope we can stop at least just one person taking steroids by making people aware of what happened to Luke, especially someone aged 28 who was fit and healthy and lost their life like that. “I knew he was doing training but I had no idea to be honest he took steroids.Just stay away from steroids. Only take what the doctor prescribes you.” During the inquest, details of Luke\u0027s steroid use were provided in a statement by his uncle Lee Nowell. He described them as having a close relationship and having supported Luke when the relationship with the mother of his children ended in 2015. At that time he encouraged him to join Wonford Sports Centre to help him get over the breakup. He then went on to train at Unit 7, previously known as Peak Performance in Exeter.  Mr Nowell recalled: “He wanted to become more muscular, particularly his upper body.   He told me he was considering taking steroids with the intention of becoming bigger. I told him several times it was not a good idea.”  He added: “I said several times he just needed to commit to training hard.” However, he did not take his uncle’s advice and admitted to often taking double the recommend intake in the hope it would enhance his physique, the hearing was told. “I was worried about him,” he admitted. Mr Stone’s niece, Kayleigh Nowell, told the inquest how Luke had been ‘a fairly big lad’ before he started training and that he would often train at the 24-hour gym two or even three times a day. She recalled: “He got more obsessive if you like when he split up with his girlfriend at the beginning of 2017. He was devastated. I knew he was taking steroids. He never hid it. I would say he did on and off over a three year period. He was a lot fitter and more confident in himself.” "},{"url":null,"title":"keep house cool heatwave sleep","story":"NewsWays to keep your home cool in a heatwave so you can relax and fall asleep easilyThe heat is lovely, but it also comes with some drawbacks - here are 17 tips and tricks to bring the temperature down\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByJo-Anne RowneyAudience Growth Editor10:05, 2 JUL 2018Updated10:21, 2 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt\u0027s awful tossing and turning in bed, stuck to the sheets, drenched in sweat. The heatwave is no fun for anyone, but there are a few things you can do to at least cool down your home. There\u0027s nothing worse than trying to nod off in your room, or trying to relax, while feeling like you\u0027re in the seventh circle of hell. Being in the midst of a heatwave is not as fun as it first sounds, especially without air con, but there are some things you can do to cool down your home and finally get some shut eye. Before we get to how to use a freezer to your advantage (not sticking your head in it) and getting as low as you can (no this isn\u0027t limbo), we have to acknowledge the quickest way is to get air con. Of course, the bad thing about getting air con is the cost - upfront and then running it - so here are a few quick tips and tricks to drop your home\u0027s temperature without spending too much.  Keep away from the satin and silk and opt for the cooler linen and cotton sheets. Light-coloured bed linen made of light fabrics (take Egyptian cotton for example) are breathable so better to sleep in. The Egyptians had it right, in fact, they even had their own method for keeping cool. Known as The Egyptian Method (original, we know) they\u0027d dampen a towel or sheet in cool water and use it as a blanket. It may be a good idea to lay the damp sheet on top of a towel first, no one likes a wet bed. 2. Freezer tricks Speaking of sheets, you can stick them in the freezer for a few minutes before you\u0027re about to go to sleep. No, we haven\u0027t lost our minds, just make sure you put them in something like a plastic bag before you pop them in. You don\u0027t want your sheets smelling of pizza and ice cream. The trick won\u0027t last all night but it will give you a breather so you can get to sleep. 3. Don\u0027t cook a roast  ...or any hot meal. Summer is never the time to be whipping up a casserole or hot meal. Put the slow cooker away, step away from the stove and have a salad. 4. Use that hot water bottle Buy yourself a hot water bottle. While we\u0027re used to filling them with hot water in the winter to keep toasty, in the summer sticking it in the freezer instead creates a lovely ice pack. 5. Turn your fan around Fans are great in the mild heat, but when it\u0027s cranked up they just blow hot air around so it\u0027s all about strategic placement. If you point them outside, slightly towards the windows, they push out the hot air. If you have a ceiling fan set them counter-clockwise to pull the hot air away. 6. Ice fan  We\u0027ve already mentioned fans, but there\u0027s so much more to be said. At school we used to use those little iceboxes to keep our food cool, so this idea comes from that. It\u0027s sort of a DIY aircon system. Use a roasting pan, or box and fill it with ice and put it in front of a fan. When the ice melts the breeze from the fan picks up the cool air coming from the ice\u0027s surface, creating a nice cool mist. 7. Cross breeze More of the fan tricks. Strategically place numerous fans around a room. Put a fan by the window, and then another further inside the room so they both push the cooler air around the room. 8. How low can you go Hot air rises so sleeping in a room on the ground floor means you\u0027ll feel cooler. If you\u0027re in a one-storey flat you can move your sheet to the ground to make life easier. 9. Don\u0027t get steamy  We imagine you\u0027re continually hopping in the shower to cool down, just make sure the water is tepid rather than warm/hot. Steam hangs about and makes a room that much hotter. 10. No lights This should make sense. Light bulbs - even if they\u0027re environmentally friendly - give off heat, so switch them off. The sun shines for longer now anyway so keeping the lights off not only saves on your energy bill, but cuts down on the extra heat. 11. Hang a wet sheet Yes, you read that right. Hanging a wet sheet in front of an open window will help bring down the room\u0027s temperature. 12. No electronic devices  The same applies here as the lights. Unplug your phone and devices, do not charge them when you are asleep. Everything radiates heat and you don\u0027t need that when you\u0027re trying to catch some zzzs. 13. Use grains Buckwheat pillows don\u0027t absorb heat like cotton does so getting one is a good investment for summer. 14. Closing curtains  In the daytime. If you think about when the sun is at its hottest those rays are coming through the window hotting everything up. Close the curtains and your room is instantly cooler.  15. Use your garden  If you plant the right trees and shrubs around the house they will provide you with much needed shade. Vines work well too. Of course that won\u0027t work for this summer, but next year you\u0027ll be thanking us. 16. Paint it white  Again, maybe one for next year, but painting your house white helps. The white colour reflects the light, cooling the house down. 17. Insulate  Long-term thinking again. When you think of insulation you probably think of keeping warm, but it can work the other way too. Good insulation keeps the heat out as well once the room is cooled down.

Rory is now the face of a clothing line aiming to \u0026shy“challenge society’s perceptions of visual difference”. He made his first catwalk modelling appearance at the launch of the Rebecca Violette fashion label. The former admin assistant, from Ayr, in Scotland, said: “I had a brilliant time modelling at the launch event.

Fire crews got there just in time to rescue him, but were left scratching their heads trying to figure out how he was able to climb to the top. He also managed to remain straddled to the light for at least an hour without falling off. It sparked a huge rescue operation, involving police, fire crews and the ambulance service, with the man\u0027s life potentially hanging in the balance. The area was also cordoned off. In photos taken by fire crews at the scene, the man can be seen perched right on the end of the light with his legs dangling either side.  It is thought he was stranded at the top for at least an hour on Saturday evening, just before 10pm. It required firefighters, from two different stations, to use a 45metre ladder to get him down - something they rarely use. The man was treated for a hand injury and taken to hospital at around 11pm, but the fire service said the incident could have ended very differently. West Midlands Fire Service tweeted: This was an unusual incident over the weekend. The man, under the influence of an illegal high, had to be brought down by fire crews and ambulance personnel using a hydraulic platform. This could of [sic] ended very differently.

Thomas Kolodzeij spent months designing the escape room in his bid to create the \u0027scariest house\u0027 in Nottingham. The 25-year-old, who runs serviced apartments in the city, said he had made plans to turn the flat and adjoining unit into a horror house business within just five minutes of stepping inside. The attraction, on St Ann\u0027s Wells Road, has been given rave reviews from horror fans from across the country - but other haven\u0027t enjoyed it as much.   In fact, Thomas said most visitors only manage to endure the nightmare experience for 30 minutes, reports Nottinghamshire Live .  He said: One group of four locked themselves in a tiny room 1m by 1m and stayed there until the actors had gone and it was time to come out. There have been some funny situations since we opened it but we have had good reviews on Facebook and TripAdvisor. It\u0027s mostly been horror fans who have come to do it. We\u0027ve had people from Essex and even further visit.  He said his latest venture is a mix between the \u0027horror house\u0027 attractions often seen in America and on mainland Europe, and the more popular escape rooms, where people are given clues to escape from a locked room. I have been to horror houses in Poland and Ukraine but I don\u0027t think they are as scary as mine, he added. That\u0027s just my opinion. It takes a lot to scare me and although I enjoyed them, I wasn\u0027t really that scared. I don\u0027t want to give too much away. We have some actors who work here but I won\u0027t say how many. It is a mix between a horror house and an escape room. It lasts about an hour, but I the average time people have lasted is about 30 minutes so far.  The idea presented itself to Mr Kolodzeij as he was walking through the property, but it took him around two to three months to make it come to fruition. Within five minutes I knew what I wanted to do, he said. There was a flat and a unit next to it so I knocked a hole in the wall to join them together. It took about two months to get ready and we opened at the end of April. We\u0027ve had about 70 or 80 groups come so far. There are still a few ideas I have that I want to use. I am always watching on the CCTV so I will see something and come up with an idea.

Zlatko Sikorsky, 34, has been charged with the murder of Larissa Beilby, 16, and will appear in court in Australia today. He was also charged with misconduct with a corspe.  Sikorsky was cornered by police last week following a 28-hour siege where he holed himself up in a flat and threatened to shoot if officers came near him.  The Courier-Mail reported that Sikorsky\u0027s lawyer Brendan Ryan said his client is innocent.  He said: The evidence will no doubt support a death through misadventure. Sikorsky is now refusing to speak to police following his arrrest. Police launched a hunt for him after the decomposing remains believed to be those of Larissa were found in a vehicle. A woman claims she saw a “dead arm” sticking out of a blue barrel in the back of a stolen utility truck when a man thought to be Sikorsky pointed a shotgun at her. Larissa was staying at a shelter for homeless youths after escaping her former violent boyfriend, and was allegedly in a relationship with Sikorsky, who is twice her age and is wanted for parole violations. Reports have claimed Larissa and Sikorsky were in a relationship, but police have only said they were associated. She had told friends she was worried he would find out that she was 16, the Courier-Mail reported.  Detectives believe a network of criminals could have been helping him hide. A man thought to be Sikorsky fled a home in Buccan, in Logan, when it was visited by police looking for the teen. A woman who lives at a gated complex in nearby Stapylton claimed to AAP that a man, believed to be Sikorsky, pointed a shotgun at her and offered her money to let him inside the estate. The woman claims she saw a dead arm sticking out of a blue barrel on the ute\u0027s tray.   She said: “There was a blue barrel with, all I’ve seen is an arm flapping out, it was a little bit scary. I just seen [sic] an arm, a dead arm.” With a gun pointed at them, the woman and her partner opened the gate and let the man inside the complex where the ute was abandoned.

It should be in the top division and I want to be part of helping the team to go up.”Siegrist confirmed a chat with his team-mate at last club Vaduz, Thomas Konrad, was a big help in him making up his mind to move to Scotland.Where he does disagree with the former Dundee defender is which is the No 1 outfit in his new home city.“I’ve played alongside Thomas for the last two years, so when I did make contact here I called him and asked him about the city.“It’s always good to get some information. He has told me some nice things about the city and he was very complementary about the place.“He tried to tell me the other team was the big one, so I didn’t listen. Obviously he played for them, but it’s all good.“He told me about some derbies but I believe he got sent off in one and did well in others. That’s him.“He did tell me that everyone is football crazy here and, when I arrived in the city myself, I couldn’t believe the stadiums are literally across the road from each other.“It’s good to be in a city where football is really a big thing.”With Slovakian goalie Matej Rakovan also signing up, Siegrist’s first challenge is to claim the No 1 jersey.It’s something he’s up for and believes having two keepers battling for a place in the team will prove a good thing for both men.“You come into a new club and you have to prove yourself. You’ve got to do all you can to earn the shirt. We’ve got to make it as hard as possible for the gaffer to pick one of us.“It’s his decision at the end of the day but I will be putting everything I can into making sure I play.“Everywhere you go you have to have competition.

That’s how it should be.”Whether he’s between the sticks or on the bench, his focus is already on what every United fan wants to see – the team getting promotion in the coming season.And after a week working with the new-look squad, he’s feeling optimistic about that.“The main focus of the club is promotion. The first few meetings I had with the gaffer, it’s all about getting promotion.“It’s a hard task, obviously it’s a hard league to get out of, but it’s good to be part of an ambitious club that wants to achieve something.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/AB8U9280.jpg-582x564.jpg ","title":"dundee new boy nathan ralph happy to complete switch but wanted his move sooner","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee new boy Nathan Ralph has revealed if he’d had his way he’d have been at Dens Park at the turn of the year.Back in the January window, the Tele reported the Dark Blues were keen on the left-back after being impressed by his performances at National League South outfit Woking.So, too, were several English league outfits but when he heard there could be a chance to head for the Scottish Premiership, the 25-year-old wanted to jump at it immediately.Rather than take the huff when it didn’t materialise, the former Ipswich Town kid, resolved it would happen this summer.“The thing happened in January when Dundee were interested and I said to my manager at the time, look I want to play higher,” he explained.“I don’t think at the time they were keen on me going, so I just thought if I can get a good season under my belt, hopefully, it will still be there at the end of the season. Thankfully, it was and I’m here now.”Over the past week he’s been getting to know his new team-mates in pre-season training.He’s liked what he’s seen of them and is loving the workouts under his new boss Neil McCann.“I’m enjoying it a lot. The training has been very good. Sometimes you feel you are just running and running during pre-season but, to be fair to the manager, he’s had us doing ball work straight away.“With running as well, of course, but it’s been with the ball and match specific stuff so I am really enjoying it.“You can get that hard work when you have the ball as well and it is important because, at the end of the day, we are footballers.“We need to control the ball and things when we are tired in games, so, to me, it makes perfect sense to be training this way.“And I’ve only been here a few days now but already I’ve been impressed with the players. Technically, and in terms of the morale of the squad, they are very good.”While he wouldn’t claim to be an expert on the Scottish Premiership yet, what he’s already realised is that it’s a good place to be right now.With top English Premier League boss Brendan Rodgers already at Celtic and Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard taking the reins at Rangers, he knows it’s a league that’s being noticed.“I don’t know too much about the Premiership up here yet but what I do know is that it’s a good standard and it’s something I’ve been really looking forward to being a part of.“I’m stepping up and it will be a challenge, for sure, but I don’t think I will be out of my depth and I am looking forward to playing in it.“I’ve been told it’s definitely a good time to be coming to this league. There are a lot of good players and a lot of attention with what’s happened at Rangers.“Even without that it is still a good standard and a top league and this has all the makings of a good season for me.”Fans will got their first chance of a first look at Ralph last night when Dundee’s friendly programme kicked off with the short trip up to Brechin.Having finished playing at Woking back in April, he can’t wait to get back to a game situation.“I’m very keen to get started with the games and I’m looking forward to them, that’s what I came here for.“The Betfred Cup is coming soon but I feel with the fitness work we’ve been doing and, with the friendly games coming, we will be ready for them.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1f819d44b02-423x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people customer base like a little community","story":"\t\t\t\t\tChoosing what to have for lunch in a bustling city centre can be a task, however, Brodie’s Takeaway has you covered.The blue-fronted shop on Bell Street is often the go-to place to grab a whole range of tasty homemade grub and it is all thanks to Cate and Ron Brodie who opened the shop almost 14 years ago.Cate said: “We already owned Brodie’s Coffee Shop in Forfar and we wanted to branch out and open another shop.“The premises we are in were already a takeaway when we took over.”After three years of running both businesses the couple decided to sell the coffee shop and focus on their Dundee business and their two children.Cate said: “We found with running two businesses and having two kids that we were just too widespread between the shops and we decided to sell the coffee shop.“It was a really hard decision to make, but with business you have to either go really big and hire managers or stay small and in control so that is what we have done.“It has also allowed us to get our weekends back to spend with our children.”Now the takeaway is thriving with masses of hungry locals heading in five days a week for the huge range of homemade food on offer.Cate appreciates though that the shop is in an ideal location with the High School of Dundee, Abertay University and the DC Thomson offices in close proximity and full of willing customers.“We have a huge amount of regulars now from all the local businesses.“The shop is now like a meeting point with everyone like a little community and we all know each other.“I also like to introduce people to each other while they are waiting in the queues for their food.“It is a way for them to network and meet new people and it’s also great for me getting to know everyone who comes in.”Now after more than a decade the owner couldn’t imagine not having the takeaway shop.“Although it is very hard work with my days lasting easily 12 hours and starting between 5-6am, I couldn’t imagine myself not having Brodie’s.“People may think it is easy, but there is a lot of work that goes on in the background that customers don’t see.Whatever you fancy to eat Brodie’s is more than likely to have it with an extensive menu ranging from homemade soups, sandwiches and burgers to daily specials including chicken curry and stovies, there is something for everyone.But owner Cate says it wouldn’t be possible without her three employees and her 81-year-old dad, Gordon Bruce.She said: “My dad is basically on call whenever we need him.

Stuart has done both during his time there.”Armstrong added: “Southampton seems a really good fit for me. Watching from afar, I really enjoy the attractive football that they play and I’m very happy to be here.“Every season, I put demands on myself to create and score goals.

It was my first real job in coaching and their academy was doing well but the club got relegated to the Conference and couldn’t afford to run their academy.“It’s a big outlay and, unfortunately, it folded and jobs went with it. I would have loved to have stayed, it was a great job and I had an excellent lifestyle.“The job wasn’t there so I came back up the road and there wasn’t much happening. I applied for jobs and I got close to a couple.“I ended up doing a bit of labouring and it was great, it was the best thing for me. I kept myself busy.“I was taking down cabins, near St Andrews funnily enough, and then building. I’d never had any experience of it but enjoyed it. Every day was different and the guys were brilliant. A lot of good people – I still keep in touch.“I always appreciated what I had as a footballer but sometimes you need to go out of it and get back in just to be reminded what you have.“So getting out for a bit was good, it got my appetite back without me realising I’d lost it. And just doing something different, seeing another side of life, meant I learned a lot.”His return to football came at Raith where an excellent record with the youths sparked interest from others.Determined to repay the faith Raith showed in him, he rebuffed the chance of a quick move but when United came calling he admits his affection for the place where his career started made it an offer he couldn’t refuse.“I enjoyed Raith, there were good people, a good club and it was tough to leave but I couldn’t turn this job down.“This is a big responsibility because United have produced some great players over the years. There’s a lot of good players come through and a lot of good people looked after the kids here, so there’s a lot to live up to. I was lucky to work with a lot of those people.”In recent years, the conveyor belt of young talent at Tannadice has slowed but Craig’s confident, along with assistant Scott Robertson, talent will flow.That’s in no small part because the mechanism required to produce players is still in place.“We know how important it is to keep bringing players through at this football club and there is talent here.“There is so much that goes on before us to get it to the stage where we take the players. It’s not about us, it’s about everything that goes before that to get them to the point where Scott and I take them.“Brian Grant (academy head) is on top of that and making it better all the time. It’s about us then doing the extra wee bit to take them to the first team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"major tayside road closed in both directions after traffic collision","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA major Tayside road is closed in both directions after a traffic collision.THIS STORY HAS BEEN UPDATED \u0026#8211 FEMALE AIRLIFTED TO NINEWELLSThe A9 is currently closed in both directions at the Dalguise turn off, about one mile north of Dunkeld, Perthshire.(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]  if (d.getElementById(id)) return  js = d.createElement(s) js.id = id  js.src = \u0027https://connect.facebook.net/en_GB/sdk.js#xfbml=1\u0026version=v3.0\u0027  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs)}(document, \u0027script\u0027, \u0027facebook-jssdk\u0027))A9 CURRENTLY CLOSED AT DALGUISEThe A9 is currently closed inboth directions at the Dalguise turn off, about 1 mile north of Dubkeld, due to a road traffic collision.Posted by Tayside Police Division on\u0026nbspMonday, 2 July 2018Folk are being warned to avoid the area if possible.THIS STORY HAS BEEN UPDATED \u0026#8211 FEMALE AIRLIFTED TO NINEWELLS\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b222ed15f5ad-847x564.jpg ","title":"more summer signings to come promises dundee gaffer mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNeil McCann is delighted with the five summer signings he’s made so far and the Dundee boss is determined more will follow.Monday saw Senegalese striker Jean Alassane Mendy fixed up on a two-year deal from Belgians Lokeren to join fellow-new boys Jack Hamilton, Nathan Ralph, Kharl Madianga and Elton Ngwatala in pre-season training.Neil felt it was import to get the bulk of his transfer business done as early as possible but his aim is to make more moves before the window slams shut at the end of August.“I hope to get one or two more in and we’ve always got targets,” said Neil.“This year we are a bit more advanced than we were this time last year and that’s good because I wanted to get a bit of business done immediately.“Now you go for ones who can probably be a wee bit more troublesome to get in but we are working hard on that and as the pre-season goes on maybe we’ll get a bit more business done.”To that end the gaffer has identified specific players and areas of the team where he wants to add more depth but will be giving nothing away on that until contracts have been signed.“I wouldn’t go into specific areas.

This concern has also been raised by a local member.“It is noted by one of the local members that residents of Invergowrie frequently raise concerns about the volume of traffic that uses the Main Street to avoid the Swallow roundabout in the evening peak. There is concern that the proposed scheme has the potential to cause an increase in vehicles using this route as a rat-run.“The application does not include any traffic flow modelling that could give reassurance in this regard. It is noted that drivers choose their routes based on what ‘appears faster’ and therefore might prefer to cut through Invergowrie rather than risk a relatively short delay at a traffic signal.”Ms Beer said that there had been 24 crashes on Main Street since 1999, which was more than similar villages in the area, and called for traffic surveys to be carried out if the work goes ahead. “This would allow the measurement of any resulting changes in (traffic) flow,” she added.“If there is such a change, with more vehicles travelling through Invergowrie, then a commitment to carry out any remedial works or an appropriate financial contribution should be required.”Councillor Richard McCready, whose West End ward includes the roundabout, said he had asked the council for details on the impact of the upgrade.He said: “Theoretically this should be a good thing but I don’t think the four ways you can go on this roundabout have equal traffic volumes.“I also want to make sure there are no adverse affects to the air quality in the area.”No details have yet been revealed on when the work to upgrade the roundabout will take place.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/59dc8f56e5322-e1530277496193.jpg ","title":"volunteer drivers needed for dundee charity delivering food to impoverished folk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new charity aimed at alleviating food poverty among families in Dundee is urgently seeking volunteers to carry out its summer programme.Dundee Bairns delivers breakfasts and lunches to impoverished families in the city during the school holidays.It is looking for delivery drivers and attendants to assist with deliveries during its Summer Fun and Food Programme which begins on Monday July 2 and ends on Friday August 11.The charity provides vans so drivers do not need their own car.

He travelled twice a week with me to Meadowbank Velodrome for numerous weeks leading up to it, standing trackside doing time checks, giving me his full support and the confidence that breaking the record could be achieved.\"Hinting that laughter was also a big a part of training sessions he added: \"We are probably the only two people who have ridden around Meadowbank Velodrome the wrong way completely naked, why I have no idea but it seemed right at the time.\"Nothing was ever a bother for Ivor and he was known as someone who you could rely on when you needed him.\"This is a very sad time and my thoughts go out to his childhood sweetheart and wife Elaine and his family and friends.\"Mr Reid\u0027s funeral will take place on Saturday at 10.30am at Inverness Crematorium.

Autistic Pride Day brought families and friends together for a picnic in Bellfield Park.Chairwoman of the group, Kabie Brook, wanted to thank everyone for coming along.\"Autistic Pride Day was rather special this year because at ARGH\u0027s request the Autistic Pride Day flag was flown at the Scottish Government HQ, St Andrews House in Edinburgh,\" she said.Mrs Brook believes that it is a day of celebration and a chance for autistic people to show they are proud of who they are.She added: \"It\u0027s also a show of defiance to those who would rather we were ashamed, quiet, or forgotten.\"The group were supported by Tesco who provided craft materials, Ashers bakery who provided a celebration cake and Strathspey Railway who donated a family ticket for the quiz prize.Special speakers

care \u0026ndash is being proposed by a newly appointed champion.After months of stinging criticism over its treatment of people with autism NHS Highland has appointed occupational therapist Arlene Johnstone to be its first head of service for learning disabilities and autism.The health board faced a storm of criticism over its decision to withdraw a \u0026pound23,000 grant for the Highland One Stop Shop (HOSS) autism support service last year and it was subsequently criticised by autism expert Dr Sue Fletcher-Watson, of Edinburgh University\u0027s Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, regarding an equality impact document that showed \"total ignorance\".Ms Johnstone says she is now keen to move on from the past, bringing a determinedly inclusive approach to her work.Acting as an advocate within the health service for autistic people and those with learning disabilities has already seen her challenging NHS colleagues drawing up policy in a range of areas to make sure their needs are properly considered.Beyond what is happening internally within the NHS she says she is also keen to reach out to partners in both the third sector and business.\"I think it is easy to say \u0027the NHS has to change\u0027 and there are things we have to change, absolutely, but there is also lots of things that have to change outside of the health service and the social care world,\" she said.Listing banks, bus companies, cafes and shopping centres as the kinds of private organisations she would like to talk to about boosting their autism-friendly credentials she added: \"I think it is crucial, because most people\u0027s quality of life is not about when they visit the GP it is when they go out with their pals socialising.\"A spokeswoman for Autism Rights Group Highland has given a cautious welcome to Ms Johnstone\u0027s appointment, saying the group knows her well and is eager to find out more about her role.Ms Johnstone is happy to hear from anyone with concerns or

similar conditions impact people\u0027s ability to perform everyday tasks due to uncontrollable shaking.Sufferers treated at St Mary\u0027s Hospital in London have experienced substantial improvement after access to the equipment, according to senior surgeons.The machine enables ultrasound waves to pass through the skull to the part of the brain responsible for the tremor.Due to the incision-less

alternative and invasive treatment. No other relevant technology was available anywhere in Scotland.Her case sparked a recent debate in the Scottish Parliament in support of her campaign for specialist equipment nearer home.She said: \"I\u0027m highly delighted.

He also said more needed to be done if city drivers were going to notice any significant difference.\"The fact the council is now looking to repair roads within the city is a start, but there are a lot of routes \u0026ndash particularly in areas such as Hilton and Lochardil \u0026ndash which are still very bad,\" he told the Courier.\"The roads budget is woefully inadequate.

McInnes said: “Sometimes you need those forward players to make the difference to turn one point into three.”On a positive day for McInnes, summer signings Stephen Gleeson and Lewis Ferguson also delivered solid debuts.Centre-back Mikey Devlin finally made his debut six months after signing on at Pittodrie.Devlin had been out for more than a year with a cruciate ligament damage but cruised through the game against Cobh.But it was Forrester who stole the show with the vital goal.McInnes said: “In terms of his touch and his passing ability the reason we brought Chris here was because he can be the difference.“I think Chris can be that for us either through his assists or his goals.“It is something that is important to him, to be more relevant in the final third rather than just be seen as a good passer.“Against Cobh Ramblers he was the difference with a lovely finish with his left foot.“He just shifts the ball on to it and gives us that bit of quality.“He scored a good goal and it was one that we deserved as we were the better side.”Dubliner Forrester was introduced on the half-hour mark at the Fota Island Resort.With the mercury hitting close to 30 degrees it was decided by both teams to split the match into three half-hour sections.McInnes said: “Chris is a confident boy and has to get used to the demands of us as well.“There were moments when you could see his quality.“His touch is so true, he plays with his head up and the crispness of passing is there.“Chris has some work to do to make sure his game is that bit more rounded for us.“That is the demands we are going to put on him.”Striker Stevie May and Sam Cosgrove were both left out of the team for the friendly having picked up knocks in training.McInnes is confident both will be fit to face Falkirk on Wednesday at Arbroath’s Gayfield stadium.The manager said: “Stevie and Sam are fine.“The ground was rock hard and maybe we over-worked them on Thursday.“Both have worked extremely well and looked sharp in the football work we have done.“It was just at the tail-end of the work on Thursday when we pushed them a wee bit.“The physios have guaranteed they will be good to go for Falkirk.”Aberdeen faced Ramblers just nine days after returning for pre-season training.In contrast the Cork-based side are midway through their domestic league.McInnes was impressed with the centre-back partnership of Devlin and Scott McKenna who never looked troubled by Cobh.However, he accepts the Reds, who hit the post through Adam Rooney, needed to be sharper up front.McInnes said: “There was a lot of good from that game.“It is a step towards where we want to be and we want to make those gradual improvements as we go along.“There was some sloppiness as you would expect.“Even though we were against a team who we were expected to beat you could see they were a bit sharper to the ball.“You could see they were a team in mid- season.“We have to make sure that we make those little steady improvements as we go along.“I can’t be disappointed as a clean sheet was never really in doubt.“We defended well and worked hard enough.“When you make so many changes in a game sometimes it upsets the fluency.“It has been a strong week for some and there is more work for some to get up to where we want.“In terms of what the players have given us since we came back in I am really pleased with their fitness levels.“I was just looking for that wee bit more quality and goal threat from the game. But other than that I have to be pleased.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"038ex0207eea_story__9","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDons boss Derek McInnes’ summer rebuilding is already paying off as all three new signings made solid debuts against Cobh Ramblers.So early in the pre-season the new faces integrating into the team so quickly can only bode well for the Battle of Britain with Burnley.This friendly in the searing heat of Cork was the first step on the road to that Europa League showdown with the Premier League Clarets on July 26.McInnes hopes to bring in more new faces before that second qualifying round first leg.However, the ones he has already secured look like they will play key roles for the Reds in the upcoming season.There was also the added bonus of the long-awaited debut of centre-back Mikey Devlin, six months after signing on for the Dons in January.Midfielder Chris Forrester was secured in a £200,000 deal from Peterborough to be a game-changer with a touch of magic or goal.He netted with an impressive finish and was busy in an attacking midfield role.Republic of Ireland international Stephen Gleeson played in the defensive midfield role alongside skipper Graeme Shinnie and brought real bite and controlled aggression.He was also calm in possession and always looked to find attackers with passes.Midfielder Lewis Ferguson, although 18, showed he will be pushing for a start and will not be content with a bit-part role.This match was moved from the original venue of Cobh Ramblers’ St Colman’s Ground to the Dons’ complex at Fota Island Resort.Essentially it was a match on a training field with a hundred or so Dons supporters scattered on a slight incline watching the action in balmy heat.It may have been a glorified bounce game for most but for defender Devlin this match was everything – the end of more than a year of hell.It was his first game action for 406 days and the chance to finally put behind him the cruciate ligament damage sustained in May 2017 while at Hamilton.Devlin signed for the Reds in January but had yet to kick a ball for them having spent his time at Pittodrie completing his rehab.If there was any apprehension about his debut it didn’t show as Devlin coasted through this match.He looked like he had been playing alongside centre-back partner Scott McKenna for seasons such was their understanding and communication.The duo are good friends off the pitch and share a flat. That connection clearly transfers to the pitch.The McKenna-Devlin partnership with Gleeson and Graeme Shinnie in front could be the rock-hard spine of the team next season.Against Cobh there was ring rust as expected as it was the Dons’ first game in nearly six weeks since the Premiership campaign ended.There were chances missed and over-hit passes but that will come during pre-season.Crucially it looked like the Reds were a unit and that the new signings had settled effortlessly into it.Cobh Ramblers are midway through their season and played on the night before this match.They lost 2-1 to Drogheda United 315 miles away and didn’t return back to Cork until 2am.Some of the players from that game faced the Dons.New signing Ferguson was pitched in from the start for his debut following his move from Hamilton.Aberdeen and Hamilton have still to go to an SPFL tribunal for arbitration over the training compensation due for the teen. The Reds offered in excess of £100,000 for the highly-rated player, although it is believed Hamilton place him at around the £900,000 mark.Aberdeen are confident a tribunal will find a figure closer to their valuation.Ferguson impressed with intelligent play and awareness.Strikers Stevie May and Sam Cosgrove were both left out of the squad having picked up minor knocks during training. Both are expected to be fit to face Falkirk in a friendly on Wednesday.Around 100 Dons fans turned up for the friendly. The weather sizzled, but the game action didn’t.Aberdeen created the opening chance in the second minute when Frank Ross found Shinnie with a cross but the skipper’s drive was blocked by keeper Adam Mylod’s legs.In the 17th minute Devlin headed across the face of goal and inches wide after connecting with a cross from Ross on the right.Moments later midfielder Ferguson had a 15-yard powerful low drive blocked at the near post by a defender.Both debutants were unlucky not to find the back of the net in that opening half hour.Such was the heat, touching 30 degrees, the game was broken up into three 30-minute periods.Having put in industrious shifts the youngsters Wright, Ferguson, Ross and Campbell came off on the half-hour mark.The two new signings of Forrester and Gleeson were both introduced with Gary Mackay-Steven and Niall McGinn also coming on.Aberdeen were denied a strong penalty claim in the 32nd minute when Adam Rooney was upended in the box but the referee waved play on.Striker Rooney was in the thick of the action again when his eight-yard header rattled off the keeper’s left post.In the 46th minute Mackay-Steven flighted a cross along the face of goal to find McGinn but the winger’s header was inches wide.Soon after McGinn fired a 25-yard free-kick high over the bar.The performance of Northern Ireland international McGinn was also a positive from this friendly.McGinn missed the final games of last season with a groin problem but looked sharp, fit and revitalised against Cobh.The opener came in the 62nd minute through debutant FORRESTER, who underlined how potent he can be up front.He is renowned for some stunning goals during his time at St Patrick’s Athletic and Peterborough, goals that are popular on Youtube.This wasn’t quite up there with those internet favourites but it was still an excellent finish.Winger Mackay-Steven burst down the flank and passed to Shinnie, who rolled the ball into the path of the summer signing.Midfielder Forrester then confidently fired home from the edge of the penalty area.ABERDEEN (first period): Lewis, Logan, Shinnie, Considine, McKenna, Rooney, Wright, Devlin, Ferguson, Ross, Campbell.Aberdeen (second period): Lewis, Logan, Shinnie, Considine, McKenna, Rooney, Forrester, Devlin (Reynolds 45), Mackay-Steven, McGinn, Gleeson.Aberdeen (third period): Rogers, Logan (Harrington 76), Shinnie, Reynolds, Considine, McKenna, Anderson, Forrester, Mackay-Steven, McGinn, Gleeson.COBH RAMBLERS (first period): Mylod, Fleming, O’Connor, Walker, McSureeny, D Murphy, Broderer, Christopher, E Murphy, Cronin, Fernandos.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeens boozy cow closes down","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen\u0026#8217s Boozy Cow has closed down, according to reports.The popular restaurant \u0026#8211 known for its no fuss burgers and cocktails \u0026#8211 is believed to have shut down at some point over the weekend.The Boozy Cow Aberdeen Facebook page has been removed and there has been no activity on the chain\u0026#8217s instagram page.The Langstane Place eatery\u0026#8217s listing on Deliveroo has also been removed.It\u0026#8217s understood the Aberdeen restaurant has shut and will reopen in the future under a new name.Owners Signature Pub Group have been contacted for comment.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/5b39c48c1bfea-639x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen shopping centres carnival themed fundraiser proves to be one great day","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA carnival-themed event in an Aberdeen shopping centre raised more than £1,000 for a children’s charity.Aberdeen’s Trinity Centre took part in One Great Day – a national series of community charity events held to raise money for Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) as well as other locally-based charities.Having taken part since 2015, it has raised just under £6,700 in total.The event, on Saturday, featured carnival stalls such as hoopla, tin can alley and hook-a-duck, as well as face painting and a glitter braid bar.General manager Linda Stewart said: “The event was really good and the centre was very busy.“The facepainting and glitter hair braids were really popular, as was the popcorn and candyfloss stall, gifted to us by local business Wowzie.“We’ll definitely have another One Great Day next year.”Linda added: “Hosting an event like this gives us the chance to help support the wonderful work of CHAS (Children’s Hospices Across Scotland) and Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity do.“One Great Day is about community engagement and raising money for a number of great causes, but it is also a fantastic opportunity for families in the area to get together and enjoy a fun day out while spending quality time together.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/EE1_0834.jpg-391x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet could you provide a forever home for any of these adorable animals","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAre you looking to get a new pet?

via the scheme’s innovative subsea cabling – the first time that cabling of this capacity has been installed on a commercial offshore wind project in Scotland.Gunnar Groebler, Vattenfall’s head of business area wind, said: “Generating power from the EOWDC for the first time, secured by Europe’s technological leadership in offshore wind, gets us to a future free from fossil fuel faster.\u0026#8220I look forward to full power later in the summer.”Adam Ezzamel, Vattenfall’s EOWDC project director, said: “We have overcome major engineering and technical challenges to achieve first power on the cutting edge EOWDC thanks to the collective expertise of Vattenfall, and our contractors MHI Vestas, Boskalis and Murphy.\u0026#8220Our priority now is to fully commission the windfarm safely throughout the summer.\u0026#8220First power from EOWDC reinforces north-east Scotland’s status as Europe’s energy capital and will help establish the region as an international centre for offshore wind generation.”Jean Morrison, chair of Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group (AREG) added: “The timescale between the first installation and first power is remarkable.\u0026#8220The techniques and innovations developed at the EOWDC will be hugely significant for the industry and should help to reduce the future costs of offshore wind.\u0026#8220As energy demand grows, we need to

European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre (EOWDC).\u0026#8220I congratulate the project team at Vattenfall for not only a successful installation but also their achievement in generating electricity from the world’s most powerful offshore wind turbines which, with each rotation at full power, will generate enough energy to power a home for 24 hours.“Once the test and demonstration site is fully operational, not only will this help the offshore wind sector to further reduce its costs through lessons learned during operations, but the output from EOWDC will itself add significantly to Scotland’s renewable electricity generating capacity, building on figures announced last month that showed installed capacity reached a record 10.4GW in the first three months of 2018 and which also

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity.

Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 1 2018","story":"\t\tHannah O\u0027HanlonUpdated: 30/05/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere are certain moments that just simply enchant us.One such moment happened this week when we were holidaying in Dunkeld.Almost every day we visited the wildlife centre at the Loch of the Lowes and delighted in our times watching the osprey.From the webcam we could see every detail.We watched with great anticipation to see when the chicks would emerge from their eggs, of which there were three.One of the days we went to the centre there was great excitement as one of the eggs was about to hatch.The staff there are dedicated volunteers who love sharing their knowledge of these wonderful birds.To our total delight we witnessed the birth first-hand as the shell cracked open and out struggled a tiny little chick as the mother bird looked on anxiously.I could hardly believe that this tiny scrap of life would be strong enough to fly to Africa in just a few months.Shortly, the father bird arrived with a very large fish and I was amazed at the tenderness of this great strong bird as he gently fed his baby.Since then we have been \u0026#8216hooked\u0026#8217 as we follow this wee family at the beginning of their journey of life.Soon the chicks will be given flying and fishing lessons and will leave the safety of the nest.My prayer is that they will all safely complete their long journey to Africa and that they will come back next year to enchant people once again.When they go, sometime in September, I fear that I will suffer from \u0026#8217empty nest syndrome\u0026#8217 till they come back again next spring.Scripture tells us: \u0026#8216Seek information from the birds of the air.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 22","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 31/05/18, 11:50 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.CalMac management’s shocking handling of our ferry service is taking its toll on local businesses which depend on Islay’s growing tourist trade.We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.Also, I have been unimpressed with our roads department management’s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from residents and myself about the potholes across Islay.Councillor Alastair Redman, IslaySir,I\u0026#8217m inviting your readers to get their walking boots or trainers on for the Stroke Association and sign up to the summer marathon challenge, Walk Your Way.In April 2013, a year after my own stroke, I took on​ the London Marathon. It was a huge step in my recovery and helped to draw attention to this devastating condition while raising money for a wonderful charity that I\u0026#8217m proud to be an ambassador for.Walk Your Way takes place between 17 June and 1 July to raise money to support stroke survivors and their families.  You can walk the whole 26.2 miles in one go, do it over a few days or spread the distance over the two-week period and get sponsored to do it. It’s your chance to take on the distance of a marathon on your own terms.For many stroke survivors like me, getting your life back means overcoming life-changing disabilities and emotional difficulties. By taking part in Walk Your Way you’ll be helping to reduce your own risk of stroke, and the vital funds you’ll raise will help the charity to support more stroke survivors to regain their independence.Sign up to Walk Your Way now: stroke.org.uk/WalkYourWayMichael Lynagh, former Australian rugby union internationalSir,What is it with people who drive cars while doing other things?As a driver I often see people behind the wheel talking on mobile phones, sending texts, touching up make-up in the mirror and, on a few occasions recently, the same man has been shaving while bowling merrily along the A83 trunk road \u0026#8211 while in a van belonging to an Argyll and Bute public agency.It just takes a split second for an accident to happen through losing concentration behind the wheel.Put down your smartphone, make-up bag and electric razor before either the police catch you or an accident happens.Name and address supplied\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 26","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 02/06/18, 3:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.What a spell of weather we have had over the past week and more.Knowing the Argyll climate, by the time you read this you might be sitting in a blizzard in front of the fire enjoying your paper but it was good while it lasted.Welcome as it is, warm weather brings its own problems.

Both professional and amateur artists in the area are encouraged to make use of the exhibition to display their work.The overriding aim of the exhibition, since its beginning in 1967, has always been to foster interest in locally-produced art and to give people from the community the opportunity to let others see, appreciate, and maybe buy their works.Organisers wish to thank the Army Cadet Force for permission to use their building.Details about how to enter exhibits will appear in adverts in the Argyllshire Advertiser, Facebook and on the exhibition website.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape. Belly dancing appears to let Sheryl, and Kerrie, rediscover a love of their own body.\u0026#8216You’re using parts of your body, probably out of commission for a while, like the pelvis and it makes a part of the body, you’re maybe not keen on, sexy.\u0026#8217The female characters in the book get up to what loud ladies in a small town would enjoy gossip and drama.\u0026#8216There is an element of bitchiness about it, which I exaggerated in the book. Or maybe it was just me that was bitching.\u0026#8217But two books later in the series, Kerrie is changing direction. Her new book, Rebel Without A Clue, is a sci-fi dystopian novel about a male alien from a female-dominated planet landing in Glasgow.\u0026#8216There’s actually not a lot of sex in my books,\u0026#8217 says Kerrie. \u0026#8216Except maybe nobody having any.\u0026#8217The story starts out as a reversal of The Handmaid’s Tale, with women of this planet no longer needing men to reproduce and evolves, through a plot described as \u0026#8216mad\u0026#8217, into an outsiders perspective of Glasgow.\u0026#8216The male alien Legless goes down to earth and goes around fertilising all these women, and doesn’t understand this world where he’s in charge.\u0026#8216Most of the time I was the only woman living in a culture different from my own. I began to see stories in outsiders.\u0026#8217Being an Australian in Scotland \u0026#8211 and on top of that marrying into a Bangladeshi family \u0026#8211 would give that outlook, of everything being familiar but just off a little. The language is the same, with the accents different. The rural community is the same, only with less terrifying monsters to deal with in Argyll. This is the outlook Legless finds himself in as a dominated man in a world of dominant men.Such an off-the-wall plot with no clear message makes the book an ink blot test \u0026#8211 you take what you’re looking for from it. Maybe you even see something else with another look.Kerrie explained: \u0026#8216Originally I wanted it to be all humour. I suppose I’m driven about power and control and it’s really fascinating when you start to think about it because people dominate in quite small ways.\u0026#8217So maybe the point was to gain the women’s perspective for men to relate to?Kerrie is currently working on her fifth book, the sequel to her dystopian sci-fi named Rebel Without A Bra, and she will keep belly dancing around Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216At the beginning you just write, and you just open up your mind and stuff comes out and you’ll find that all this stuff comes out that you didn’t realise you were thinking about.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"its gonna be a close shave gavin","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt\u0026#8217s been eight months in the making, but it\u0026#8217s getting hairy now.The razors, however, will soon sort that out for Gavin Allan.He has been growing his flowing locks and bushy beard since October last year, but Gavin will be shorn for charity on Saturday June 30.Gavin\u0026#8217s head and beard shave is being carried out in aid of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research and the Doddie Weir Foundation.Former Scottish rugby international lock forward Doddie Weir revealed in June 2017 he was suffering from MND, a degenerative condition affecting the nerves in the brain and spinal cord that tell your muscles what to do.

Would you know who most at risk is, how to protect the area or whether you should remove the helmet of a downed rider?Following the success of the Biker Down courses last year in Oban Community Fire Station, new dates have been set for this summerTwo free sessions will be held in Inveraray Community Fire Station on July 8 and August 26 .As many bikers ride in pairs or in groups, it is often the case that the first person on scene following a collision involving a motorcycle will be a fellow biker.Actions taken in the first few moments after an accident can be crucial in minimising injuries and can make a real difference to the lives of those involved. But there can be some uncertainty about what to do in these situations.Training motorcyclists in how to deal with a casualty can save lives and Biker Down courses include ways of keeping the scene safe, first aid appropriate to common types of injury and the issues of safely removing a helmet.The course \u0026#8211 aimed at motorcyclists of all ages and experience \u0026#8211 uses the expertise of the emergency services to prepare motorcyclists should the worst happen on the roads. Biker Down is not about lecturing riders on the consequences of things going wrong – it is about equipping them to make a difference if they encounter an emergency.The course will show you:How to manage the scene of a bike crash, using the same principles the Fire Service uses. We will show you how to protect yourself and others, how to prioritise your actions, how to collect information for the emergency services and how to make use of the resources you have available to you, including other people.Ways of taking care of a casualty, including basic life support and the why, when and how of removing a crash helmet.What may work (or not work) when it comes to making yourself more visible to other road users. You will also learn about how people look for and recognise objects and how you can help to make sure that other road users see you.Scottish Fire and Rescue Service’s group manager for Argyll and Bute, Stuart McLean said: \u0026#8216Firefighters are frequently called to the scene of collisions and when a report comes through of one involving a biker there’s always great concern. Motorcyclists are particularly vulnerable and a crash that would be likely to cause only minor damage to a car could easily claim their life. A\u0026ampB is home to many country roads enjoyed by bikers, so road safety is clearly a key issue for our team.\u0026#8217Anyone interested in learning more about the Scottish Biker Down or would like to book one of the courses can email adam.barclay@firescotland.gov.uk to book your place on the course or visit our Facebook page ‘Biker Down Scotland’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"council pays formal tribute to islays ww100 group","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 2:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowArgyll and Bute Council has formally recognised Islay’s ambitious programme of events commemorating two World War One tragedies off the coast of the island.Council members thanked Islay\u0026#8217s WW100 committee for providing an inspirational programme of events to commemorate the centenary of the sinking of SS Tuscania and the collision of HMS Otranto, which took place off the shores of Islay during the Great War.At a meeting of the full council this week members paid tribute to the group for their part in organising the national remembrance events, honouring those who lost their lives in the incidents, and providing a lasting legacy for the local community.Provost of Argyll and Bute, Len Scoullar said: \u0026#8216The WW100 group both national and local must be congratulated for arranging such a well-organised series of events to honour and pay respect to those who lost their lives in these tragedies, and commemorate the people of Islay who were involved in the response to the incidents.\u0026#8216The island really came together, engaging young and old, showcasing resilience, compassion and kindness.

Collapsing ceilings and water leakage have led to a further deterioration in the fabric of the Victorian pile.  Now it is understood South Ayrshire Council bosses want to step in before it is too late. It is believed a last minute paper may go before councillors at full council in County Buildings on Thursday. The paper would ask politicians to approve the repair work. The council slapped a Dangerous Building Notice on the hotel in March, which gave the owners 21 days to respond. There are fears Ayr train station could end up shut if no action is taken. And it has been slammed a risk to the public. The Post revealed earlier this month how the hotel has been bought by new Malaysian owners from Eng Huat Ung.  Station Hotel Action Group founder Esther Clark believes the hotel could be turned into a community centre and accomodation. She said it should be “split up and dispersed” but must generate an income. She has uncovered research, which reveals the hotel was built to a “high standard” with luxurious materials. One idea mooted by Ayr Renaissance is for a part of the building to be demolished and a new train station built. Others folk have called for the council to adopt the landmark for offices. It was hoped a big hotel group would step in and carry out refurbishment but it has failed to attract interest so far. Network Rail carried out scaffolding work on the building to safeguard the operation of the station and line in 2015. The hotel, a Grade 2 listed building, has remained shut since it closed suddenly in 2013. Glasgow and South-Western Railway Company built the hotel, designed in the style of a French chateau, at a cost of \u0026pound50,000.

And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"andrews-mum-and-sis-go-the-distance-in-bid-to-find-cure","story":"THE family of a West Linton man struck down by a rare and debilitating health condition have raised almost \u0026pound10,000 with two marathon sporting challenges.\nAndrew Macnab was diagnosed last August with dermatomyositis.\nFewer than one in a million people are affected by the incurable condition which causes skin rashes, muscle weakness, and inflammatory myopathy.\nBut treatments can control the symptoms and research is ongoing to try to find a cure.\nLast month, Andrew\u0027s wee sister Helen, who lives in Stow, completed her very first marathon in Edinburgh - raising a staggering \u0026pound5,200 for Myositis UK.\nAnd just last week Andrew\u0027s mum Jean, along with her friends at West Linton Golf Club, raised a further \u0026pound4,100 with a 24-hour golfing challenge.\nThroughout the challenge Jean managed to play for the entire 24 hours - completing an amazing 140 holes.\nJean told us: \"Although I was a little weary by the end of the relay, I was over-joyed by the support and friendship from the members of West Linton Golf Club as well as many others from the village and beyond.\n\"The relay has raised funds to date of over \u0026pound4,100, providing another great boost for the funding of research by Myositis UK.\"\nBoth Jean and Helen are continuing to raise money for Mystosis UK which carries out research into the Andrew\u0027s condition.\nThe volunteer-led charity works to improve the diagnosis, treatment, understanding, and prognosis of the rare inflammatory myopathies.\nJean added: \"Andrew continues to fight against the effects of that illness, and has recently been showing small signs of improvement \u0026ndash at long last.\n\"We know that further research is essential to understand this rare illness, and find which treatments are most effective.\n\"As well as hoping that such research will improve Andrew\u0026rsquos chance of a full return to normal life, we hope that others suffering from this cruel illness can be helped.\"\nTo support Helen - www.justgiving/fundraising/helen-runs-edinburgh-marathon - or Jean - www.justgiving/fundraising/west-linton-ladies-golf - visit their justgiving pages.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"bins-set-alight-outside-hawick-shop","story":"WITNESSES are being sought after two bins were set alight near a shop in Hawick.\nThe fire happened at around 3.25am on Friday, June 22 on the town\u0027s High Street.\nTwo large metal wheelie bins were set alight at the rear of The Card Factory store, however quick action of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service mean the fire was extinguished before the flames could spread.\nAs a result, the outer wall and a window sustained damage, while one of the building vents was also destroyed.\nNo one was injured and inquiries are ongoing to identify whoever was responsible.\nInspector Kevin Harris from Hawick Police Station said: \"Had this fire spread then a number of homes and businesses could have been affected.\n\"We are keen to hear from anyone who remembers seeing anything suspicious within the High Street during the early hours of Thursday morning, or who can help us trace the culprits.\n\"Anyone with information should contact police immediately.\"\nThose with information can contact Hawick Police Station via 101 and quote incident number 426 of June 22.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"were-so-proud-of-him-parents-of-galashiels-scout-with-adhd-hope-to-inspire-others-to-join-group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

SS took his portion of fish after his family were fed and satisfied.\nLater that same day, SS returned with more fish and he was certainly making up for lost time.\nHe began to feed the youngsters himself while Mrs O was preening. The chicks were visibly stronger and more energised than the day before when they were hungry.\nAfter the first chick was full it lay down on its side while the other chick fed and when it had had enough to eat, chick number one would get up and come back over for seconds.\nThe week progressed into warm weather and scorching sunshine and the chicks ranged from being sleepy and still, to being far too adventurous, toddling about the nest using their budding wings as little stilts to enable them to clamber around.\nThese little excursions led them to venture too far to the edges and the parent birds used distraction with fish to bring them away and back into the middle.\nThey also began to pay more attention to the nest construction, by moving sticks around and building up the edges, like little safety barriers to prevent any toppling over the edge.\nSadly, for one osprey family in the Borders, two chicks did fall to their death from the nest during the recent high winds.\nBut the attentive Mrs O and SS seem to have metaphorically red taped the danger zone by building stick walls just high enough to prevent any earnest climbing from a curious young osprey wanting to peer over the side.\nvar panels = panels || []var panel = {    name: \u0027RelatedArticles\u0027,    target: \u0027related-articles\u0027,    params: {ns: \u0027redesign\u0027, \u0027article_ids\u0027: \u002716326935,16326589,16326578,16326073,16323973\u0027, \u0027more_articles_heading\u0027: \u0027More articles\u0027}}panels.push(panel)\nBy now, the young ospreys have grown stronger and the fluffy down is spotted with the onset of growing feathers.\nThey no longer look feeble and weak and their fortunes have rapidly turned around since the fish supply has picked up.\nWe finally have news of PX1 (Paxman\u0027s bird) whose satellite tracker alerted us to the fact that he had died in the north of Scotland near to the Helmsdale River.\nThe carcass and tag have been recovered and it seems that his neck was broken, we believe, from colliding into newly erected deer fencing along the side of a forestry plantation.\nIt is such a terrible shame to lose this wonderful, healthy, two-year-old male osprey.\nJeremy Paxman was very saddened to hear of the loss of this bird and we are very grateful to him for his interest and support for the Tweed Valley Osprey Project.\nHe has agreed that his involvement will continue in the future, through the tracking of further ospreys.\nThe volunteers for the osprey project were invited to attend the ringing of goshawk chicks this week in Tweed Valley Forest Park and they were privileged to witness them being fitted with red darvic rings with white letters of JP and PL, by Tony Lightley, after Eve Schulte climbed the fir tree to lower them to the forest floor.\nRhona Anderson took some great photos of these magnificent birds and she has also been filming pine martens in the forest.\nThe captured footage of the whole pine marten family together and the antics of the three little kits with their mum and dad can be viewed in the video above or at \nhttps://www.flickr/photos/borderslass/28099626057/in/photostream/\nRead the latest Tweed Valley Osprey News every week throughout the summer in the Border  and Peeblesshire News newspapers\n"},{"url":null,"title":"500-mile-cycle-across-scotland-raises-20k-for-charity","story":"AN INNERLEITHEN man has cycled 516 miles in five days \u0026ndash raising \u0026pound21,000 for charity.\nMountain biker Kevin Marshall recently completed the mammoth challenge around the north Scottish coastline \u0026ndash all in aid of a cause close to his heart.\nThe idea to take on the challenge originated during a mountain biking trip to Glencoe last August, when Kevin, and his friend Steve, both agreed they wanted to do something to support the charities Macmillan and Friends of Anchor, who helped Steve\u0026rsquos mum and dad, and Kevin\u0026rsquos mum, before they passed away.\nKevin said: \u0026ldquoWe agreed that the North Coast 500 (NC500) was a suitably tough challenge, both to raise awareness and hopefully raise a reasonable amount of cash.\n\u0026ldquoThe team that completed the ride with me are all very close friends, the majority of us met when we were 18 when we started university in Aberdeen and have been close friends ever since.

window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit

The formation had been flying over the west of Scotland for ten minutes when the incident occurred.Lieutenant Loveless climbed the aircraft to a safe altitude and the crew prepared for an emergency single-engined landing at the nearest suitable base which was Machrihanish.According to the citation, Lieutenant Loveless flew a \u0026#8216flawless\u0026#8217 single-engined approach.Guided by RAF radar controllers at Machrihanish, the aircraft emerged from the cloud at 800 feet and made a safe landing.FIFTY YEARS AGOThursday June 27, 1968Stowaway on the DuchessFor what is believed to be the first time ever, the T.S. \u0026#8216Duchess of Hamilton\u0026#8217 turned back to Campbeltown on its outward journey on Sunday.The reason? On board was an eight-year-old Campbeltown \u0026#8216stowaway\u0026#8217.The youngster, Freddy Mathisen, had been at the pier watching the steamer and had gone aboard while she was berthed at the Old Quay.Freddy explored the vessel and for some reason didn\u0026#8217t notice the steamer getting underway. Indeed, the turbine was abreast of Trench Point when a tearful Freddy \u0026#8216gave himself up\u0026#8217 to a ship\u0026#8217s officer.The orders were given for the vessel to turn around and head back for the Old Quay where a crowd had gathered.Two pairs of brawn arms lifted Freddy ashore and the boat got up steam once more.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSaturday June 29, 1918Wedding of Miss Graham of SkipnessOn Saturday June 22, a marriage was celebrated in St. Brendan\u0026#8217s Church, Skipness, between Mr Robin George Collingwood of the Naval Staff Intelligence Division and Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford, and Miss Ethel Winifred Graham, youngest daughter of the late R.C. Graham Esq. of Skipness.The little church, decorated with white marguerites and ferns picked by the children attending Skipness school, was full of friendly well-wishers, many of whom had known the bride from her infancy.The bride wore a simple white georgette gown trimmed with Italian lace given by her aunt, Lady Monkswell, and a veil of old Brussels lace over a wreath of small white roses.Round her neck was a necklace of lapis lazuli and gold, the gift of her brother, Mr R.F. Graham, and she carried a large bouquet of wild flowers, gathered by the boys of the place.She was attended by seven little girls from the village as bridesmaids.In spite of the war and the tempestuous weather, many flags had appeared and the village was gay with sunshine, flowers and bunting as Mr and Mrs R.G. Collingswood drove away amid universal good wishes, to Claonaig Lodge for their honeymoon.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"islay mans sentence deferred","story":"Scott Kevin McGurn, aged 24, of 11 Bayview, Port Ellen, appeared from custody on Monday in Campbeltown Sheriff Court.He pleaded guilty to assaulting a police constable by lunging towards him and striking him on the head with his own head, in the car park of Islay Hospital, Bowmore, last Saturday.He also pleaded guilty to driving whilst disqualified from holding or obtaining a licence and while over the drink drive limit on one of the island\u0026#8217s two principal roads, the A846, at its junction with Antrim View, Port Ellen, at 11.15pm on Friday June 22.The proportion of alcohol in his breath was 84 microgrammes in 100 millilitres of breath, more than three-and-a-half times the 22 microgramme limit.His not guilty plea to a charge of driving without insurance was accepted.Procurator fiscal depute Eoin McGinty told the court McGurn has a record of previous convictions.Honorary sheriff Alan Walker deferred sentence until Thursday July 26.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"pounds for green fingered pupils plants","story":"Last Thursday P4/5 held its annual \u0026#8216Go Green Day’ event in the school gym and sold many of the plants grown by green-fingered pupils.A report from teacher Alison Semple read: \u0026#8216In preparation all pupils planted and grew a variety of plants and flowers to sell, enhancing their existing knowledge and understanding of the planting process and developing their gardening skills.\u0026#8217On the day, pupils wore green items of clothing or accessories to further promote the event.Miss Semple added: \u0026#8216In addition they created items using recycled goods, made beautiful flower arrangements with the help of the talented Mrs Lorna McKinven and Mrs Irene Millar, produced ‘Green themed’ baking goods, made fruit kebabs in pots,  held a bric-a-brac stall,  ‘ECO themed games stalls  and much more.\u0026#8216We were extremely lucky to have received fabulous donations from Fresh Connection, Saddell Nurseries, Auchencorvie Sawmill, Gordon Allen, Tesco, Co-op, Glenbarr Nursery and The Factory Shop.\u0026#8216Everybody would like to say a huge thankyou to these organisations for the donations and also to the teachers, parents and staff who contributed, to make this event extremely successful.\u0026#8216The day raised £409 in a short period of time and the raffle winner was Mrs Blanchflower who won a beautiful bunch of flowers and bird house.\u0026#8216All proceeds will go to our ECO fund to help further develop the school garden area and outdoor learning resources ultimately enhancing children\u0026#8217s experiences and environment.\u0026#8217P5\u0026#8217s Laura Ondova, Gemma McCaig and Emma Oman sold Minion\u0026#8217s hair novelties for five pence.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-prestonpans-childrens-gala-day","story":"              Prestonpans Children\u0027s Gala Day went ahead yesterday as families braved the stormy weather to enjoy the fun.

She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

North Berwick\u0026rsquos Law Primary School P6 pupils were looking forward to the trip to Yellowcraig, by Dirleton, where one class was due to camp out tonight (Wednesday) and another tomorrow (Thursday).  Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.  The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders. That\u0026rsquos why I\u0026rsquom pleased cabinet has agreed that the council will hold a consultation and carry out a feasibility study. This will be launched in due course.

They say they are being overlooked by customers at the supermarket car park who can see through the fence into the communal garden area in front of their ground-floor properties at Mill House on Eskmills Road, which is managed by Dunedin Canmore Housing Association.  Margaret and Keith Morris moved from a Dunedin Canmore property in Bathgate last September into the phase two of Mill House \u0026ndash an amenity housing development for residents aged 55 and over.  Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.  She claimed that she and her husband had called on the housing association for permission to fill in the gaps in the fence to allow more privacy but claimed they had been told they couldn\u0026rsquot as another resident liked it that way.  \u0026ldquoWe wanted to get these slats which are only 94p. We would pay for them and fill in the spaces, she added.  She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.

The operation at the site off Edinburgh Road took place last Thursday.  Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

These machines reward people for recycling by providing money or vouchers in return for empty containers.  Iceland\u0026rsquos reverse vending machine will accept Iceland\u0026rsquos empty plastic beverage bottles and repay customers with a 10p voucher for each recycled bottle to be used in store.  The Musselburgh installation follows Iceland\u0026rsquos industry-first trial in London last month.

It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.

In war, and in peacetime, our armed forces have promoted peace and security, confronted terrorism, and delivered aid to those in need.  \"That\u0026rsquos why, as Provost of East Lothian, I value occasions such as Armed Forces Day. A chance to give thanks, remember, reflect and look ahead.\"  Mr McMillan also paid tribute to the role of women in the military and in times of conflict, noting that 2018 was also the 100th anniversary of the first women being given the vote.  He said: \"Women played a significant role in the war effort, taking on work such as farming, transport and munition production, and the perseverance of Suffrage activity subsequently led to women being given the right to vote.  \"For a number of years now women have deservedly been playing a full and active role in our Armed Forces \u0026ndash reflective of the increasingly inclusive society in which we all live and are so keen to protect.\"  Veterans who attended the ceremony on Monday were invited to enjoy refreshments after the event."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7979931.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scotlands-best-black-pudding-made-in-east-lothian","story":"              A NORTH Berwick-based butcher is celebrating after it was judged the makers of Scotland\u0026rsquos finest black pudding.

The debate during Health Question Time at Holyrood last Wednesday followed a recent public meeting which was organised by East Lothian MP Martin Whitfield and Lothian MSP Kezia Dugdale (both Labour) at the Fisherrow Centre, which attracted more than 200 people.  Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"              VIKTOR Krum, Percy Weasley and Malfoy\u0027s sidekick Goyle are all heading to Musselburgh this summer to join in the fun as Harry Potter\u0027s \u0026lsquoSchool of Witchcraft \u0026amp Wizardry\u0026rsquo arrives in the town.

WE ALL know that tadpoles turn into frogs. Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"              SCOTTISH Ministers are to be urged to refuse planning permission for an electrical substation on the former Cockenzie Power Station site because it could prejudice future development there.  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS \u0026lsquoglory days\u0026rsquo in the history of golf are shared with visitors to the town\u0026rsquos museum this summer.  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.  The museum is open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30am to 4pm each day."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8006789.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"coast-road-closed-after-car-overturns","story":"              THE A198 has been closed and emergency services are at the scene after a car accident near Gullane.

A retail development with four units and a \u0026lsquodrive-thru\u0026rsquo coffee shop are proposed at the site to the west of the town, close to the Oak Tree Junction of the A1.  The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"              A COMPUTER arts student will fly halfway round the world as part of a three-person team taking part in the finals of an international Microsoft competition.  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.  The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.  Twenty-year-old Emily\u0026rsquos involvement in the project is the latest step as she attempts to land her dream job.  She added: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove wanted to work in computer games from like primary school.  \u0026ldquoMy end goal is to try to get a job doing 3D somewhere, which is doable."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7733122.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"annie-lennox-is-installed-as-glasgow-caledonian-university-chancellor","story":"              SINGER Annie Lennox has officially been installed as the first female Chancellor of Glasgow Caledonian University.

Picking a favourite Scottish album from such a packed field was always going to be a tough task, and so it proved when we asked readers to do just that.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  We were inundated with hundreds of votes from across Scotland, the UK and as far afield as the Netherlands, Sweden and the US, and our quest got folk talking and reminiscing in offices, pubs and on social media, revisiting and celebrating the music that has been the soundtrack to their lives.  So, here we have it: Scotland\u0026rsquos top 10 favourite albums.  10 \u0026ndash Raintown, Deacon Blue, 1987    The band\u0026rsquos debut is packed to the rafters with sheer quality and from beginning to end simply never lets up. Dundonian singer-songwriter Ricky Ross showcased his talent, intent and also a keen political and social awareness across 13 songs, among them Scotland\u0026rsquos other national anthem, Dignity.  9 \u0026ndash High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983    Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth and reimagined them as perfectly-crafted jangle-pop. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  8 \u0026ndash Strange Kind of Love, Love and Money, 1988    Though Love and Money\u0026rsquos particular brand of literate, glossy soul-pop looked to America for inspiration, lyrics about \u0026ldquoraining on Jocelyn Square were resolutely, affectionately Glaswegian. In another place, another time, Love and Money could have been the biggest band in the world.  7 \u0026ndash If You\u0026rsquore Feeling Sinister, Belle and Sebastian, 1996    Second albums are supposed to be difficult but Belle and Sebastian arguably never surpassed the stunning collection of songs that comprised their sophomore effort, giving a masterclass in how to mix melody, melancholy, nostalgia and humour.  6 \u0026ndash Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991    The album that thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is This Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  5 \u0026ndash Heaven Or Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990    Elizabeth Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest musical pleasures and treasures, and this most accessible of Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is simply awash with blissed-out grandeur. Could they really have been from Grangemouth? Oh yes.  4 \u0026ndash A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984    Sounding nothing like anything else that came out of Scotland, the UK or indeed anywhere else in 1984, this debut fused spare synth precision with exuberant vocal sincerity to stunning effect. Tinseltown in the Rain, that bittersweet slice of cinematic perfection, remains the ultimate ode to Glasgow.  3 \u0026ndash The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008    Since Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos untimely death in May, listening to the music he and his bandmates created has been a particularly sad and difficult task. But this album is simply too good to stop listening to. Revisiting is painful but cathartic, and like all of the \u0026nbspHutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.\u0026nbsp  2 \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, The Trashcan Sinatras, 1993    From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  1 \u0026ndash Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989    Only seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. For almost 30 years it has offered endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  Here\u0027s what you said about Hats:  Christine Gardner, Rotterdam: Head and shoulders above the rest. A magnificent album that I continue to listen to regularly after almost 30 years. It is quite simply a masterpiece. It continues to draw you in, delight your senses, touch your emotions and somehow mirror your own very personal experiences. And yet it is also essentially Scottish \u0026ndash maybe something to do with our collective psyche, despite all our individual differences.  Martin McCarthy: Hats has so many layers, from dreamy songs like Over the Hillside and Let\u0026rsquos Go Out Tonight to more upbeat songs like Headlights on the Parade and \u0026ldquoThe Downtown Lights.  Saturday Night is just a sublime song, I love the pitch perfect bass, the stunning keyboards and Paul Buchanan\u0027s emotional voice. This was played at our wedding to a full dancefloor and will always be so special. The songs on Hats convey love, beauty, pain and loss, and can push me to tears of utter joy and euphoria.  Alex Watkins: It\u0026rsquos the album I always return to just something about the memories and emotions it always conjures up.  Kevin Jackson: Hats is the best album ever recorded anywhere by anyone. It touches you in a way that others must stand back in awe and adoration of. It is a thing of perfection. When some of the finest innovative talents of our time see it as one of the greatest albums ever, it is because it has no peers.  Peter Morgan: I\u0027m going to plump for Hats, that lush, aching, bruised and battered homage to love and loss.  John Reader: I listen to a lot of music, including lots of new stuff but always have Hats on at some point every week. Still hooks me in with its lush simplicity. I remember saying to someone more than 25 years ago that of all the music around at that time I reckoned I\u0027d be listening to Hats for the rest of my life. Not wrong so far.  Colin Lunn: I love A Walk Across the Rooftops, the best first album by any group, not only in Scotland but worldwide. However, Hats was probably a better, more perfect album although it didn\u0026rsquot have the same influence. Tough, tough choice but I\u0026rsquoll go for Hats by a very, very fine margin.  Here\u0026rsquos what you had to say about some of the other music on the list:  Kyle Wallace: I\u0027ve Seen Everything by the Trashcan Sinatras is part of the soundtrack to my life. Listened to it through my dad\u0027s death and the college years. So many great songs associated with great memories.  John Richards: This was a very difficult choice. Scottish groups (I\u0027m Welsh) have a disproportionately large place in my music collection \u0026ndash particularly those who came to prominence in the 1980s. My top 20 regularly features the work of the Blue Nile, Danny Wilson, Aztec Camera, Deacon Blue and Love \u0026amp Money. However, it\u0027s got to be an album from the year I turned 19, when I went to university and the myriad possibilities that life had to offer opened up before me. The song (and album) that soundtracked that life-changing period is still my favourite Scottish album: Strange Kind of Love by Love \u0026amp Money.  Stuart Duncan: My vote is for The Midnight Organ Fight by Frightened Rabbit. An album that, as your writer said, \u0026ldquomakes it feel it\u0026rsquos OK to be sad. The lyrics hit home more than any album I\u0026rsquove ever listened to. Scott Hutchison gave me a feeling that everything was going to be OK, that I would get through things. I\u0026rsquod say he helped changed me as a person. It still hasn\u0026rsquot stuck in that he\u0026rsquos no longer here [Hutchsion took his own life in May] but my vote would be the same regardless of the circumstances.  Danny Tennyson: My favourite album by a Scottish band \u0026ndash or any other band for that matter \u0026ndash has to High Land Hard Rain, by Aztec Camera. The fact that Roddy was probably only 15 or 16 when he wrote most of the tracks for the album makes it all the more remarkable. He continues to be a genius to this day.  Shane Brown, Illinois: Why is it that I live in the centre boring part of America (the states you fly over to get somewhere else interesting), and should by location and birthright be a huge fan of Slipknot, but instead find myself with a vast collection of Scottish indiepop? From the Cocteaus to the Fannies, Belle \u0026amp Sebastian to Teen Canteen, Scottish indiepop has been the soundtrack to my life. How and why the music of your land speaks to me, I\u0027ll never know, but no album speaks to my soul more than Cake by the Trashcan Sinatras \u0026ndash a record I find as comforting as a cup of coffee on a cold winter morning. I really, really love it to this day, and why those lads aren\u0027t universally revered as musical genius is beyond me to this day. I\u0027ve travelled hundreds of miles to see them live and I\u0027ll continue to do so as long as they grace us with the occasional American tour.  John Jauchler, Connecticut: Lots of good stuff on your list, but my vote goes to the Trashcan Sinatras\u0026rsquo I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything. Outstanding musicians and really nice guys as well. Their music has made a difference in my life.

Whilst travelling\u0026nbspthrough India he came across an old British school satchel\u0026nbspand taken by the design, he decided to get a few made by local artisans. He sold these satchels from the attic in his home, as well as a few vintage furniture pieces from India. These satchels and vintage furniture proved to be quiet popular as they were items people couldn\u0027t get anywhere else.  Things started to grow.\u0026nbspToday,\u0026nbspScaramanga is made up of a team of 10 and has become a globally recognized brand that sells online as well as out of their shop in Cupar.

Here the sun always shines, the men have six packs, the women have curves in all the right places and the only thing you need to worry about is how much grafting (to use the show\u0027s lingo) you have to put into attracting the opposite sex.  Unless you\u0027ve been living in deep freeze, it\u0027s hard to escape the cultural phenomenon that is the Bafta-winning, dating reality TV show, Love Island. It revolves around a dizzying array of \u0026ldquosexy singles who purport to be looking for true love, along with the \u0026pound50,000 prize money (or, let\u0027s be honest, a launch pad for a celeb career), and spend up to eight weeks in a luxury villa in Mallorca trying to convince audiences that they\u0027ve found the man, or woman, of their dreams. It\u0027s knowingly narrated for laughs by Scottish comedian Iain Stirling and hosted by reality TV veteran Caroline Flack.  Whether or not it\u0027s working out for contestants, Love Island\u0027s fourth series is certainly pulling in the audiences of ITV2\u0027s dreams. An average 2.9 million people tuned in for the launch episode on June 4, more than double that of the first episode in 2017. Last week it was the highest-rating TV show at 9pm, with audiences \u0026ndash more than half of whom are in the 16-34 age range (the holy grail of TV producers) \u0026ndash peaking at 3.4million viewers. It has an overall audience share of 16 percent, that rises to almost 50 percent of younger viewers, and a whole range of merch.  Even if it sounds closer to your version of hell than paradise, there is no denying its widespread influence. But it\u0027s only a daft game show, right? As with any mainstream hit there\u0027s been plenty of sneering, about those who watch as much as those on-screen. In some ways you can see why.  In a month in which Donald Trump\u0027s immigration policies at the US border saw toddlers ripped from their mothers\u0027 arms and children kept in cages, while others were bombed in Yemen, could we really feel justified in worrying about whether Wes Nelson would be best off sticking with 29-year-old air hostess Laura Anderson or cracking on with surgically enhanced Megan Barton-Hanson? As Brexit negotiations continued to hurtle towards the cliff-edge, dragging us all towards who-knows-what, was it really OK to stuff our fingers in our ears until 9pm when we could relax into wondering if increasingly uptight and awkward A\u0026ampE doctor Alex George would finally convince a girl to fancy him?  Dr Faye Woods, lecturer in film and television at Reading University, dismisses this either/or view. She points out that while audiences of this female-targeted series are met with derision, it\u0027s not just socially acceptable, but actively expected, that men will down tools to watch the World Cup.  \u0026ldquoThis is an event bringing the nation together that isn\u0026rsquot terrible men\u0026rsquos footie, she says. \u0026ldquoLove Island gives us that space to breathe and focus on something else, a little oasis of pleasure amidst our current darkness. We can hold multiple thoughts in our brain simultaneously, and refocusing for a while every night is healthy for our well-being.  Which seems fair enough. And who doesn\u0027t like watching beautiful people? There\u0027s a fascination not just in their symmetrical features and gym-fit bodies, but in the amount of effort that goes into grooming \u0026ndash the carefully layered tans and whitened teeth, shaved chests, perfectly arched brows and painted nails (which mostly happens off camera, as if by magic).  \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s a kind of vicarious pleasure, reckons Gladeana McMahon, a psychological adviser for reality shows such as the early Big Brother series, and the driving force behind the production of the \u0026ldquoEthical Guidelines for Reality TV produced by the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy. \u0026ldquoThis is the gladiatorial pit without the violence.  But as she points out, ITV2 has set out to get big audiences by going for a winning formula, that is, in many ways, nostalgic and safe. While it\u0027s supposedly all about glamour and sexual sizzle \u0026ndash once you\u0027re coupled up with someone you share a double bed in the dorm and see what you can get away with under the duvet \u0026ndash this dream seems in some ways weirdly old-fashioned.  In an age in which woke millennials are seemingly increasingly accepting of gender as a fluid rather than a binary concept, the stereotypes on display \u0026ndash where men talk about treating women like queens, being \u0026ldquogentlemen, and some of the girls play dumb to get the guy \u0026ndash pull progressive views up short.  It\u0027s all about the archetypes. Adam Collard \u0026ndash trading on Garden of Eden associations and looking for temptation \u0026ndash describes himself as tall, dark and handsome, with great abs. What more could anyone want, he wonders aloud? (A little bit of respect and common decency it turns out, but more of that later.)  As Nicola Bishop, a researcher in English and television at Manchester politan University, notes: \u0026ldquoThis is \u0026lsquopin-up\u0026rsquo TV with little diversity of body types. There is a lot of readable anxiety among the male competitors about measuring up against perceived physical ideals of masculinity.  The love on this heteronormative island is not for everyone. There are lots of reality TV shows that have been very positive about representing LGBT contestants \u0026ndash Brian Dowling, winner of Big Brother\u0027s second series, is testament to that. This isn\u0027t one of them. While last year\u0027s Love Island did include a short bisexual romance between two of the women, and host Caroline Flack hinted there may be gay contestants in the future, bosses are clear. It\u0027s a dating show for straight couples and everyone needs to fancy each other. They claim they wouldn\u0027t rule out a standalone show but none is forthcoming so far.  As versions of romance go, despite the bed-swapping, it\u0027s an interestingly traditional one. Several commentators have pointed out that with its claustrophobic sense of ennui, codified courting behaviour and double-crossing, the dream on offer has more than a whiff of Jane Austen about it all.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s the Diana story, it\u0027s Cinderella, adds McMahon. Considering the number of people getting married in the UK is at an all-time low, there\u0027s an awful lot of talk about it. Adam claims there\u0027s not a girl in the house that he wouldn\u0027t want as a wife, while Laura hints to 20-year-old Wes, after sharing a bed with him for a few weeks, that she\u0027s on the look-out for a husband.  While in the real world there might be an increasing acceptance of less traditional relationships, or even non-monogamous ones, what\u0027s on offer here is what writer and columnist Laurie Penny refers to as Love TM. This search for Mr or Mrs Right is what she calls \u0026ldquothe narrow romantic fantasy that trumps all other forms of love, which is put on a pedestal as the answer to all our life problems and insecurities and never questioned. As beautiful lawyer Rosie Williams, ditched by Adam, cries to the other girls \u0026ldquoI just want to be enough, you wish she already knew she was.  It is her experience too that shows the darker side of the fairytale \u0026ndash Hans Christian Andersen rather than Disney \u0026ndash with Women\u0027s Aid going as far as issuing a warning about spotting the signs of abuse in response to Adam\u0027s \u0026ldquogaslighting of her (a term used to describe psychological manipulation aimed at making someone question their version of reality). The charity said there were clear warning signs in Adam\u0027s behaviour of emotional abuse and called on viewers to speak out against unhealthy relationships.  Faye Woods claims that though it\u0027s \u0026ldquodistressing emotionally to watch this play out on television, it\u0027s been valuable \u0026ldquoin terms of understanding and awareness of everyday behaviour. She adds: \u0026ldquoI think of all the people who may have dismissed coercive control, but then saw it in practice with Adam and Rosie and then understood it.  Then there\u0027s the issue of race. From the off it was not lost on black women writers and commentators such as Danielle Dash who noticed the way the statuesquely beautiful Samira Mighty \u0026ndash the only black woman in the house \u0026ndash was over-looked by all the boys and ended up with Alex because he\u0027d been usurped in his first choice by another man. On Friday, with another cohort of boys arriving in the villa resolutely uninterested in her, she finally broke down claiming to be \u0026ldquoso confused.  On the outside there is less confusion as people fit the pieces together. There\u0027s the way the public \u0026ldquoforgot to vote for singer Alexandra Burke, who outdanced all her competitors week after week on Strictly Come Dancing and repeatedly ended up in the dance off, the black girls passed over in dating show Take Me Out, the racist incidents in Big Brother House\u0027s gone by. Reality TV, argue many, has form.  Dr Kehinde Andrews, professor of Black Studies at Birmingham City University, hasn\u0027t watched it but isn\u0027t surprised by the concerns. \u0026ldquoReality TV is popular because it resonates with people, he says. \u0026ldquoSo we shouldn\u0027t be surprised when it replicates the racism that we see in society. Actually television often shows a world that is artificially equal. It\u0027s very rare now that something like Midsomer Murders \u0026ndash showing an all-white world \u0026ndash will be commissioned. So we sometimes get a distorted view when in actual fact the country is really segregated. In reality TV we see the reality that society is dominated by ideas of white supremacy.  It\u0027s not just the way the characters interact \u0026ndash it\u0027s also the way it\u0027s cast and edited, he claims. \u0026ldquoIf you look at who made the show, who picked the characters, who commissioned it in the first place, you\u0027ll probably find that it reflects a bias, he adds. \u0026ldquoThey [producers] should be mindful of that, more responsible. But fixing Love Island isn\u0027t going to do anything. It\u0027s a symptom of the problem.  Though unlikely to start viewing now, he admits it\u0027s probably more important than some give it credit for. It\u0027s certainly important to the millions of fans, following contestants\u0027 Instagram accounts in their droves, live-tweeting their own social commentary, or dissecting it with their mates on group chat. On Twitter there\u0027s support for Samira, complaints about Adam and other men\u0027s behaviour towards the women, and of course the inevitable backlash, calling out double standards. Discussion around the \u0026ldquosexual shaming of the women, when contestants were asked to share the number of people they\u0027d slept with, was red hot. On screen Laura\u0027s 30 was initially met with embarrassed silence, while Adam\u0027s 200 with backslapping.  Yet writing in the Times earlier this month Caitlin Moran claimed it is that interaction that makes Love Island an unlikely vehicle for feminism \u0026ldquobecause we live in an era when every one of the classic tactics used by these men \u0026ndash gaslighting, denial, coercion, guilt \u0026ndash is met with a fabulous deconstruction on social media. For the first time we have live, rolling footage of total ledges trying the kind of mindf***y shenanigans that previously have happened in the privacy of bars or the back of cabs ... That smirk! If you see a man smirk like that, leave immediately by the nearest exit, for you are dealing with a human trash-fire.  Online chat is also about spotting who is genuine (ie the loveable Dani Dyer and her boyfriend, stationery salesman Jack Fincham, whose loyalty during separation had hearts melting) and who is faking it. Who is merely playing the game? It\u0027s a rolling audience commentary that underlines the fact that just being young doesn\u0027t make you dumb.  As Faye Woods says: \u0026ldquoReality TV is never real, and all viewers know this. It is non-viewers who attempt to dismiss them as gullible. Reality TV is built for savvy, sophisticated viewers, who are able to pivot effortlessly between awareness of this as constructed process and an emotional immersion.  Paradise, then, might be a great way to switch off. But, it turns out, Paradise deconstructed might have plenty to tell us about our society and youth culture today, as long as we\u0027re ready to listen."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8004636.jpg?type=article-full","title":"iona-christian-community-in-final-bid-to-save-facilities","story":"              It is described as cradle of Christianity in Scotland.  In 563 AD the Irish monk, St Columba set up a monastic community on the tiny isle of Iona.  Since then it has become a haven for pilgrims, welcoming some 1,500 guests to its Hebridean shores every year.  However recently the fate of the historical abbey precinct has been plunged into doubt after the Christian group based on the island said it has veered dangerously into disrepair.  The Iona Community has said that years of heavy use have taken their toll on the residential facilities at the island\u0027s abbey, with a recent survey revealing that \"without some urgent repairs and long-term major investment, they would be unfit for purpose within seven years\".    It is now launching a final push of its Iona Abbey Capital project to help raise the last \u0026pound500,000 by the end of this year.  On its completion, the project will deliver improved access, new bedrooms and fully accessible shower rooms and toilets, as well as improved insulation and washing facilities at the centrer.  Current \u0026lsquoprivate\u0026rsquo spaces in Iona Abbey will also become accessible to the public as part of the project.  Reverend Kathy Galloway, the joint leader of the Iona Community, said the group had now completed phase one of the works, and now needed more help to fully fund phase two.  She said: \"We want to adapt the living areas to be accessible for wheelchair users and people with mobility issues.  \"We also want to install a renewable energy heating system and winter proof the building so that we can extend our season to welcome more visitors and volunteers each year. At the moment, many rooms are too cold to use past October.\"    Iona Abbey in 1953  Already, \u0026pound3 million has been raised for the project, including \u0026pound300,000 in the month of May alone.  Working in partnership with Historic Environment Scotland and Iona Renewables, it also aims to provide a renewable energy heating system, through a progressive, community-led energy project.  The group said they are now in the position to begin phase two earlier than expected, which will lead to substantial savings, meaning the refurbished project will be ready to open a year early in 2020.  Reverend Galloway said: \"The Iona Community wants to continue to welcome people to share life in community for generations to come, and to make sure we are accessible for all.  \"This complex, exciting project will ensure people from around the world can continue to share in the community\u0026rsquos life within the historic setting and beauty of Iona,\" she said.  In 1938, the Reverend George MacLeod established the Iona Community in the docklands of Govan and on Iona in order to rebuild the monastic quarters of the medieval abbey.  Set in the context of the poverty of the Depression, he brought together unemployed skilled craftsmen and young trainee clergy to serve as a sign of hopeful rebuilding of community in urban Scotland, aiming to rebuild \"the common life by working and living together, sharing skills and effort as well as joys and achievement\".  This has shaped the practice and principles of the group, which acts as an ecumenical Christian community of men and women from different walks of life and different traditions in the Church engaged together.    Outside Iona Abbey in 1953  Since its completion in 1965, the monastery remains a centre for pilgrimage and tourism, with the community now running three residential centres on Iona and the nearby island of Mull.  Now, there is a year-round population of more than 100, including long-established island families as well as more recent arrivals, including those who work for the Iona Community in its centres as staff or volunteers.  Guests come to stay on the island to contemplate and pray, and play a significant role in the island\u0026rsquos economy.  Daily services of the Iona Community are undertaken in the Abbey church, with abbey itself managed by Historic Environment Scotland  Built of stone and slate, the buildings of the Iona Abbey Centre were originally the living quarters of the monks and have retained a distinctly monastic feel.  However, in a report sent to the Church of Scotland\u0026rsquos general assembly two years ago, the Iona Community said that \"piecemeal maintenance and sporadic upgrading of internal services, electrical, water, sewerage and heating have led to constant and uneconomic patchwork repairs.\"  As of this year, both the Abbey Centre and the MacLeod centre -- a newer building on the island, have been closed to residential guests.  Reverend Galloway said the group was hopeful that \"people in Scotland and beyond will recognise the great need to safeguard Iona Abbey as a living place of hospitality, and ensure that thousands more people can visit this special place seeking sanctuary and inspiration\".    The Refectory  In 563AD, the Irish monk Columba (Columkille) established a monastic settlement on the island of Iona, leading to large parts of Scotland and the north of England to become evangelised.  As an important centre of European Christianity, it became the site of a Benedictine abbey in the Middle Ages and for centuries it has attracted thousands of people on their own pilgrim journeys.  The Abbey also has a substantial collection of stone crosses which date back to within 200 years of its founding, some of which show Celtic influences thought to come from Ireland.  The carved stones include St John\u0027s Cross and St Oran\u0027s Cross, and a cross slab created 100 years later.  The crosses are thought to be among the finest examples of such sculpture to survive.  Others bear the stamp of the Vikings who first raided Iona in 794 AD."},{"url":null,"title":"learner-drivers-should-have-to-spot-potholes-to-pass-test","story":"              Learner drivers should have to prove they can spot potholes to pass the test, according to a motoring firm.  The AA wants poor road surfaces to be included in the hazard perception test because of the damage they cause to vehicles.  It also called for advice on what to do when drivers encounter a pothole to be added to the Highway Code.  One in five local roads in England and Wales is in a poor condition as councils face a huge funding deficit to tackle potholes, a recent report by the Asphalt Industry Alliance warned.  Hazard perception is part of the theory driving test and involves candidates identifying something that would cause them to take action such as slow down or change direction in 14 video clips.  The pass rate of the practical driving test fell to a nine-year low of 45% after changes to make the exam more realistic were introduced in December last year.  The AA advises motorists who spot a pothole to:  - Slow down if necessary but keep an eye on the rear view mirror  - Stay in lane  - Avoid big swerves  A survey of a small sample of driving instructors found that the majority have broken down during a lesson at least once in the past 12 months because of pothole-related damage, and many have to adapt lessons to avoid certain roads where there are too many potholes.  Some learners have even had to abandon a practical driving test because their car was damaged by a pothole, the AA was told.  Damage to tyres, wheels and suspension are the most common problems.  AA president Edmund King said: \"It is a sad indictment of our poor road conditions that instructors are having to adapt their lessons to avoid potholed roads.  \"More troubling is the fact that lessons and tests are being abandoned because of pothole related breakdowns.  \"This is damaging to learners\u0027 confidence and to instructors whose livelihoods depend on having a fit-for-purpose road network and an undamaged car.  \"The situation is so serious that the hazard perception test and Highway Code need to change to reflect the state of the roads that learner drivers have to learn on.  \"There is no advice for drivers about potholes anywhere in the Highway Code yet it is one of the most common hazards they encounter.\"  Drivers are being urged to photograph potholes and send them to the responsible highway authority and the Department for Transport to demonstrate the scale of the issue as part of the AA\u0027s #FlagitFunditFillit campaign.  The Government said the DVSA keeps the driving test under constant review to make it as effective as possible.  It said in a statement: \"We have listened to the concerns of road users and are already providing councils in England with over \u0026pound6 billion to help improve the condition of our local highways.  \"This funding includes a record \u0026pound296 million through the Pothole Action Fund - enough to fix around six million potholes.\""},{"url":null,"title":"uk-business-secretary-hints-brexit-transition-period-could-be-extended-beyond-2020","story":"              THE Business Secretary has added to the tensions inside Theresa May\u0026rsquos divided cabinet by suggesting the post-Brexit transition may have to be extended.  Greg Clark said the status-quo period, which is due to end in December 2020, some 21 months after the UK formally leaves the EU, should be set by \u0026ldquofacts and evidence.  He suggested new computer systems and other border controls might not be ready by 2020.  On Ridge on Sunday on Sky News, Mr Clark, who has said practical business concerns must come before ideology on Brexit, refused to rule out an extension.  He said: \"At all times we need to be guided by the evidence on this. Speaking to the people that run [the port of Dover and Eurotunnel]... there are things that would need to be put in place, computer systems for example posts at the border, even if they checked, automatically number plates.  \"What we need assess is how long it would reasonably take to put in practice. It seems to me that any reasonable person would have to be guided by the facts and the evidence.  His comments were echoed by Andrea Leadsom, who said 2020 was \u0026ldquonot a magical date.  The leader of the Commons said 2020 \u0026ldquoshould be long enough but \u0026ldquoremains under review.  She told told HuffPost UK: \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos been agreed is the end of December 2020. And it\u0026rsquos not a magical figure, a magical date. It\u0026rsquos just what has been agreed with the EU.  \u0026ldquoI personally think it should be long enough. That\u0026rsquos my view. It\u0026rsquos fine as it is. We don\u0026rsquot need for any particular reason to extend it.  \u0026ldquoBut I think it remains under review. As all sides make very clear, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  The idea of extending the period the UK in which maintains much of its relationship with the EU, while losing influence in Brussels, is an incendiary one for Brexiters, who fear it would postpone new trade deals and prolong freedom of movement, creating \u0026lsquoBrino\u0026rsquo, or Brexit in name only.  It is also likely to worsen the break-down in cabinet discipline ahead of this Friday\u0026rsquos crunch meeting at Chequers, where Mrs May hopes to finalise the UK blueprint for Brexit.  Brexiteers oppose the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos favoured option of a customs partnership with the EU, which would see the UK collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods entering the country on behalf of the bloc.  However both options have been dismissed by the EU.  It emerged at the weekend that Brexiter Environment Secretary Michael Gove had physically ripped up an official report suggesting he had come round to the customers partnership plan.  Asked if the customs partnership option was still on the table, Mr Clark said: \"Yes.\"  The chair of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, Sir Graham Brady, publicly pleaded for government unity.  Writing in the Observer, he said his party risked looking divided and letting in Labour.  He said: \u0026ldquoElectorates these days are volatile, but one thing is certain: they do not vote for divided parties. They rejected decisively the divided Tory party in 1997.  \u0026ldquoIf we were to let Labour in again, it would be a disaster for this country.  Damian Green, Mrs May\u0026rsquos former deputy, also attacked the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos fractious cabinet.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have seen threats against her, attacks on business, and cabinet ministers taking the proverbial out of each other\u0026rsquos policies. All of this in full public gaze. It has been an unedifying spectacle of oversized egos showing they are not fit to be officers.  Housing minister James Brokenshire admitted there were \u0026ldquostrong views on either side of the cabinet over Brexit, but he remained confident the Friday meeting at Chequers would end with a \u0026ldquoclear direction and a white paper published the week after.  There are now effectively only six weeks of negotiating time before the UK is supposed to agree a final deal on trade and other aspects of Brexit with the other 27 EU countries.

Festival organisers DF Concerts and Events said music fans enjoyed \u0026ldquounbelievable festival weather, while director Geoff Ellis added that he \u0026ldquocouldn\u0026rsquot have asked for better on our first weekend of TRNSMT.  Temperatures reached over 25C yesterday as Arctic Monkeys headlined at their only UK festival appearance this year, while fans also enjoyed performances by Fatherson, Blossoms and Interpol.    Police said the behaviour of festival-goers had been overwhelmingly positive, however, the warm temperatures kept staff at the on-site hospital busy, with more than 700 people receiving treatment for weather-related, minor ailments.  Alan McWilliam, on-site medical manager, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos been a busy event for us, but our team have coped incredibly well and our on-site hospital has offered a first-class service to festival-goers.  \u0026ldquoSo far, we\u0026rsquove seen 710 people across the festival, mainly for minor ailments and weather-related assistance.  \u0026ldquoAll in all, there\u0026rsquos been a positive atmosphere on-site.  Elsewhere in Glasgow, another festival \u0026ndash Fiesta X FOLD, in Kelvingrove Park \u0026ndash saw performances from Nile Rodgers, Emeli Sande, the Pointer Sisters and Goldfrapp over Saturday and yesterday.  Music fans at both sites had been warned to wear sun cream and drink plenty of water to combat the hot weather and ensure they enjoyed the performances. TRNSMT will return next weekend with sets from The Killers, Chvrches, Franz Ferdinand and Texas \u0026ndash and forecasters predict that the warm weather will hold until then.

The red-legged seriema - named Elvis - was rushed to a specialist facility after her keepers at Blair Drummond Safari Park noticed that she was unusually quiet and struggling to eat.  A CT scan at the University of Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies revealed the screw in her stomach and vets quickly removed it with the help of a miniature camera.  Vet Dr Bronwyn Koterwas, of the Exotic Animal and Wildlife Medicine and Surgery service at the university, said: \u0026ldquoElvis was very poorly when she came to us.  \u0026ldquoThanks to our advanced scanning equipment and dedicated team of experts working across departments we were able to rapidly spot what was wrong.  \u0026ldquoWe are delighted that Elvis has left the building and has returned safely to Blair Drummond.  Red-legged seriemas are native to South America and stand around a metre tall, thanks to their distinctive spindly legs.  The birds are very inquisitive and often peck at foreign objects, which can prove harmful to their health.  In Elvis\u0026rsquo case, her keepers quickly realised that she as in trouble and called in expert help from the university straight away.  Working quickly, they tested the bird\u0026rsquos blood and referred her for a high-powered CT scan.  The screw was removed without the need for invasive surgery and Elvis was able to return to Blair Drummond the day after she was admitted and is now doing well.  Sheila Walker, Animal Collection Manager at Blair Drummond, said: \u0026ldquoIt is imperative that when any of our animals are sick that they are seen by vets with expertise and the experience necessary to treat the species and we are very fortunate that the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies is only a short drive away.  \u0026ldquoElvis does a short walk from her aviary to the presentation ground and we think that is where she possibly picked up the screw.  \u0026ldquoOur keepers now do a quick sweep of the track before bringing her out."},{"url":null,"title":"cheryl-and-liam-payne-announce-split","story":"              Cheryl and Liam Payne have split up after a two-and-a-half-year relationship.

Immature eggs have been shown for the first time in a laboratory to survive on ovarian tissue which was removed from cancer patients before treatment and stripped of cells, researchers said.  It is hoped this engineered structure could be re-implanted into women and restore fertility after they have completed chemotherapy or radiotherapy.  Scientists from the Rigshospitalet, in Copenhagen, Denmark, proved the graft worked when using human tissue transplanted into mice.  Experts said the research, presented at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) annual meeting in Barcelona, \u0026ldquoholds much promise for the future.  Many cancer treatments can damage the ovaries, stopping the body from producing eggs and meaning a woman cannot get pregnant. Women dealing with a diagnosis can choose to have their eggs frozen, while some doctors may offer to remove or freeze all or part of an ovary so it can be transplanted back after treatment.  However, there is a small chance that grafted ovarian tissue could reintroduce cancer cells.  A \u0026ldquobio-engineered ovary would reduce this risk, the research team from Rigshospitalet said.  Their experiments used ovarian tissue removed from women trying to preserve their fertility before cancer treatment. The cells from the tissue were eliminated using chemicals, leaving behind a \u0026ldquobio-engineered scaffold on which the early-stage egg-containing follicles were reseeded.  Dr Susanne Pors, who presented the research, said: \u0026ldquoThis is the first time that isolated human follicles have survived in a decellularised human scaffold and, as a proof-of-concept, it could offer a new strategy in fertility preservation without risk of malignant cell recurrence.  Experiments in which the structure was transplanted into mice showed it could support the survival and growth of the follicles.  Commenting on the research, Professor Nick Macklon, medical director at London Women\u0026rsquos Clinic, said it was an \u0026ldquoexciting development.  \u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquove been able to show that they can then introduce back into that tissue stored follicles and early-growth eggs, that then appear to grow in that material that\u0026rsquos had all the cells removed, he said.  \u0026ldquoAnd, that this can then be placed back into the body and hopefully allow women to re-establish their cycles to possibly conceive, either naturally or with IVF, while reducing this risk of cancer.  He said the technique was \u0026ldquolikely to develop into something that will be potentially useful, but said further research was needed to prove it will work in humans.  Stuart Lavery, consultant gynaecologist at Hammersmith Hospital, said \u0026ldquoIf this is shown to be effective, it offers huge advantages over IVF and egg freezing."},{"url":null,"title":"loki-and-heseltine-to-headline-festival-of-politics","story":"              THE rapper Loki is to appear at this year\u0026rsquos Festival of Politics at the Scottish Parliament.

The Scottish Labour Women\u0026rsquos Movement (SLWM), which include MPs and MSPs, has formally raised the recent appointment of Jim Monaghan as a party organiser in Scotland.  Mr Monaghan, who was a spokesman for the Defend Tommy Sheridan Campaign and believes the former Socialist MSP was the victim of a conspiracy, is being paid around \u0026pound30,000 a year to promote \u0026ldquosocial change.  However his appointment has astonished Labour insiders who remember his work on behalf of Mr Sheridan, who was jailed for perjury in 2011.  Mr Sheridan successfully sued Rupert Murdoch\u0026rsquos News International in 2006 for \u0026pound200,000 after the former News of the World paper claimed he was a swinger and an adulterer.  However at a subsequent criminal trial a jury found he had lied under oath during his defamation action.  During both cases, Mr Sheridan labelled his many female accusers as liars, infuriating former colleagues.  The defamation case led to a split in the Scottish Socialists and Mr Sheridan forming his breakaway Solidarity party, which Mr Monaghan also joined.

The win gives him a broad mandate to upend the political establishment and govern for the poor.  An official quick count from electoral authorities late on Sunday forecast that Mr Lopez Obrador would win with between 53% and 53.8% of the votes, a remarkable margin not seen in the country for many years.  Early on Monday, with about 40% of the votes counted, his advantage was close to the quick count\u0026rsquos statistical sample.  A prominent exit poll predicted that his party allies were poised to score big victories in congressional races, possibly winning absolute majorities in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.  Mr Lopez Obrador, who campaigned on vows to transform Mexico and oust the \u0026ldquomafia of power ruling the country, rode widespread voter anger and discontent with the governing Institutional Revolution Party, or PRI, of President Enrique Pena Nieto and had led opinion polls since the beginning of the campaign.  The PRI, which dominated Mexican politics for nearly the entire 20th century and recaptured the presidency in 2012, was set to suffer heavy losses not just in the presidential race but in other polls as well.  In brief remarks at a hotel in central Mexico City, Mr Lopez Obrador called for reconciliation after a polarising campaign and promised profound change but with respect for the law and constitutional order.  \u0026ldquoI confess that I have a legitimate ambition: I want to go down in history as a good president of Mexico, he said, after losses in the previous two elections. \u0026ldquoI desire with all my soul to raise the greatness of our country on high.  The president-in-waiting, whose term will begin on December 1, devoted much of his speech to appealing to citizens of all stripes and seeking to reassure those who have eyed his candidacy nervously.  \u0026ldquoThis new national project will seek to establish an authentic democracy and we do not intend to establish a dictatorship, he said. \u0026ldquoThe changes will be profound, but in accordance with established order.  Conservative Ricardo Anaya, of a right-left coalition, and the PRI\u0026rsquos Jose Antonio Meade acknowledged defeat shortly after polls closed nationwide. The quick count had them on around 22% and 16% respectively.  Mr Lopez Obrador\u0026rsquos supporters began wild celebrations in Mexico City, cruising up and down the central Paseo de la Reforma boulevard honking horns to the tune of \u0026ldquoViva Mexico! and waving Mexican flags from car windows and sunroofs.  Thousands poured into the sprawling main square known as the Zocalo, where the 64-year-old former mayor of the capital had called on his backers to rally. Many danced to mariachi music.  Retired teacher Susana Zuniga beamed and said the country was experiencing a moment similar to the Mexican Revolution a century ago.  \u0026ldquoThe people are fed up. That is what brought us to this, she said.          Congratulations to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on becoming the next President of Mexico. I look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico!          \u0026mdash Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 2, 2018  US President Donald Trump tweeted congratulations: \u0026ldquoI look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico!  Mr Lopez Obrador said individual and property rights would be guaranteed, promised respect for the autonomy of the Bank of Mexico and said his government will maintain financial and fiscal discipline.  He said contracts obtained under energy reforms passed under President Nieto will be scrutinised for any corruption or illegality, but otherwise contracts will be honoured.  \u0026ldquoThere will be no confiscation or expropriation of assets. \u0026hellip Eradicating corruption will be the principal mission, he said.  Mr Lopez Obrador also spoke of support for migrants and said the most forgotten and humble people of Mexico will be given preference in his government.  He said he will seek a relationship of \u0026ldquofriendship and respect with the United States. And rather than the use of force to fight spiralling violence, he will look to fix root causes such as inequality and poverty.  \u0026ldquoPeace and tranquility are the fruits of justice, he said.  Exit polling by Consulta Mitofsky for the Televisa network forecast wins for allies of Mr Lopez Obrador\u0026rsquos Morena party in at least four of eight state governor races on the ballot plus for the head of government in Mexico City. The central state of Guanajuato was expected to go to a candidate of the conservative National Action Party.  Mitofsky predicted Morena allies would take between 56 and 70 seats in the 128-member Senate and between 256 and 291 in the 500-seat lower house.  \u0026ldquoThe anger that the average Mexican feels toward the way things are being governed has favoured Lopez Obrador, said Shannon O\u0026rsquoNeil, senior fellow for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos been able to capture the mantle of the person who\u0026rsquos on the outside who wants change.  In a speech to the huge crowd in the Zocalo, he struck a moderate tone, stressing a need to act respectfully, to maintain economic and financial stability.  He also pledged to increase support payments for the elderly and to give scholarships or paid apprenticeships to young people.  \u0026ldquoNow that he has won, he cannot fail this new generation that believes in him, said Mariano Bartolini, a 29-year-old lawyer who voted for Mr Lopez Obrador in the north-western city of Rosarito, near Tijuana.  \u0026ldquoIt is thanks to us young people who are supporting him that he was able to get more votes than he did in past elections."},{"url":null,"title":"business success for kintore couple","story":"\t\t\t\tDonna and Jason Orton, who have been helped by Business Gateway Aberdeen City \u0026amp Shire, opened the doors to their unique business in Abercrombie Court, Westhill, just over a year ago.

Prime and cull cattle manager, Tim McDonald, expects the steady trade for prime cattle to continue and perhaps strengthen in the next few weeks and reports a particularly strong trade for fleshy cull cows. He is looking to England’s involvement in the World Cup in Russia, coupled with the forecast of good weather, to stimulate barbecue parties south of the border and boost the burger market.“The cull cow market has shown a big lift since April when farmers were too busy trying to catch up with drilling and the late spring. Demand for good, fleshy cows for the processing market is particularly strong and we have seen prices hit a top of £1,830,” said Mr McDonald.He also suggests it would be worthwhile for dairy farmers to consider feeding cull dairy cows to put on more flesh rather than marketing them in lean condition at the end of lactation.“The auction system is leading the way in cull cow prices and dairy farmers have the opportunity of making more money from well-fleshed cull dairy cows to supplement their income from milk,” he said.                                                                                                        The first real marker of the new season will be the show and sale of store cattle at Thainstone Centre on Friday, July 13, and as always some of the top suckled calves and stores from the summer shows will be on offer at the annual Spectacular show and sale on August 24.Turning to the sheep market, the phenomenal market for old season lamb continued right through the spring and ANM’s weekly sale at Thainstone Centre was still attracting up to 2,000 head right to the end of May.Prices peaked on April 5 when 4,782 head averaged 284.3p/kg (£126.21/head) with record numbers the following week attracting a massive entry of 7,952 to average 250.5p (£109.72/head).“The strongly rising market saw the auction ring come into its own as prices increased week after week,” said deputy livestock manager, Colin Slessor. “The level of prices achieved would never have been attained without the auction system leading the way and resulting in the strongest spring market for sheep we have seen for many years.“Those hoggs will have been bought in the trough of last autumn’s store trade when prices were down £5/head on the year. Finishers have enjoyed the double benefit of a lower purchase price and a high sale price which will have boosted margins and should augur well for this year’s autumn store lamb sales.”                                                                                                        Trade is being driven by a combination of strong demand, both on the home market and for the export market to Europe, and reduced imports from New Zealand.This season’s prime lamb market has started off on a high with some lambs hitting £130 - £140/head, and the cull ewe trade also rising sharply, peaking at £200 with pure Texels and Suffolks realising £170 - £190/head.The prospects remain encouraging and numbers will start building up from July onwards. Again, the auction system will be a vital element in ensuring producers achieve the best price available on the market.Despite weather problems during lambing, many farms are reporting a good lambing and good lamb numbers. The fantastic weather through May has transformed the performance of lambs as grass growth has taken off and lambs are set to reach the market early and in good order.The availability of grass has also triggered the market for ewes with lambs at foot with prices up around £10/head. Mule hoggs with single lambs have been making up to £140/head.“The strong prime market will hopefully impact positively on store markets which were in the doldrums last autumn,” says Mr Slessor.“The store lamb trade has been buoyant and prices have increased significantly, with finishers achieving good margins on last year’s lambs. Lamb producers in the Highlands and Islands certainly need a lift in price to give them a much needed boost following last year’s disappointing autumn trade.”With more ewe lambs being culled this year, rather than retained for breeding, trade and demand for gimmers is also likely to be stronger.Aberdeen and Northern Marts’ auction staff look forward to meeting customers at the forthcoming summer shows. The mart will have stands at the New Deer, Caithness, Turriff, Black Isle and Keith shows where auctioneers and field staff will be present to discuss the prospects for the autumn trade.

A £1.5bn package of improvements making it easier for people moving onto Universal Credit was announced in the Budget. People applying to Universal Credit can now receive a 100% advance on their first payment and the 7-day waiting period for new claimants was removed earlier this year. Among other improvements, from April 2018 the Government also continues to pay Housing Benefit claimants’ rent for two weeks - which is non-recoverable - when moving onto Universal Credit.Minister for Employment Alok Sharma said: “Universal Credit is central to our commitment to help families improve their lives by moving into work. We know it’s working – with Universal Credit people are moving into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system. “And now we are rolling it out to a wider range of people in a safe and controlled way. From today, more people, including families and disabled people, can claim Universal Credit and access the extra help it provides.”Single jobseekers are already receiving support from their dedicated work coach to find employment or increase their hours and earnings. Now, all types of claimants will be able to benefit from the improved, personalised, one-to-one support that Universal Credit offers.

We’d encourage anyone who needs extra help or information to come and talk to their work coach.”Those on Universal Credit will now have 24-hour access to an online account that they can use to manage their claim, including reporting changes of circumstances, checking the details of their claim and date of their next Universal Credit payment.

By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general. I hope we can bring lots of jobs and apprenticeships to the area.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was \u0026ldquovery disappointed by the decision as the Wick harbour team has worked \u0026ldquoextremely hard to make the port an attractive base.\u0026ldquoAs the larger of the two offshore wind projects proposed for this area, it would have been a significant boost to the harbour and the region to have MORL based here, she said.But she added: \u0026ldquoIt has been fantastic to see the progress made at Wick harbour this year in preparing for the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd operations and maintenance contract, and we look forward to the benefits this will bring to the area.Eann Sinclair, programme manager for the Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership, was also disappointed by the decision. However, he is confident there will still be opportunities for Wick harbour to get work in the Moray Firth area.MORL spokesman Craig Milroy said Wick was in the running for the O\u0026ampM base along with Buckie and Fraserburgh. A memorandum of understanding had been signed with Wick.\u0026ldquoAll three were strongly engaged with us but we chose Fraserburgh, he said. \u0026ldquoThere was not a single reason for choosing Fraserburgh but a combination of circumstances. All the ports were very competitive and attractive.Monday 2 Jul 2018 2:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Halkirk butcher hangs up his apron for the final time","story":"IT was the end of an era in Halkirk as local butcher Hugh John MacKay hung up his shop apron for the last time.Hugh, who ran MacKay\u0026rsquos of Halkirk as well as the Lifestyle Express grocery store, decided to retire after five decades of service.However, the Bridge Street butcher\u0026rsquos shop will still be run by a MacKay as Hugh\u0026rsquos son Matthew will take overHugh was the third in line of MacKays who owned and ran the butcher\u0026rsquos shop for the Halkirk community.Hugh grandfather, John, started the enterprise with a store in Lybster before setting up the shop in Halkirk then it passed on to Hugh\u0026rsquos dad \u0026ndash who was also named Hugh \u0026ndash with his uncle Angus taking over the Lybster shop before handing it over to his son, David.As for the Halkirk shop, Hugh, now 68, was only 16 his father died, \u0026shyleaving the family to take over the running of the shop.Hugh revealed it would not have been a success without the determined work of his mother, Belle.He said: \u0026ldquoI had just turned 16 when my father passed away.

He will be succeeded by Ian Ross, the former East Sutherland and Edderton Highland councillor.Sir Anthony\u0026rsquos decision to step down ends a long association with the area which started in 1993 when he was appointed as chairman of the then UK Atomic Energy Authority. He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy. Good schools and hospitals are another factor.\u0026ldquoI think the partnership has made a real contribution in the last 10 years, Sir Anthony said. \u0026ldquoWe have worked with other agencies to help create around 1000 jobs over that time but we all had to work together to do it. I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism.

His first order of priority, however, must be the unfinished business of implementing cheaper ferry fares on ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“Having already waited a decade since the government first introduced RET on west coast routes, people in the Northern Isles should not have to wait any longer.“The First Minister promised RET in the first half of 2018. That means Michael Matheson must deliver before parliament rises for the summer recess at the end of this week.”Mr Halcro Johnston says that the Northern Isles have been left in limbo by the RET uncertainties, adding that he has written to Mr Matheson in a bid to see the RET commitment delivered.He said: “The new transport secretary has just days to implement RET for ferry fares to Orkney and Shetland, in line with commitment made by his predecessor and after years of promises from the SNP.“The constant delays we have seen regarding RET have caused real uncertainty in the Northern Isles and have left residents and visitors unable to plan journeys knowing what the eventual costs will be.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

All we are now waiting for is confirmation that it’s fully legal and then we can get on with implementing it. Our lawyers have told us that because we are a commercial operation and currently receive no subsidy whatsoever, we have to be 100 per cent sure that this scheme complies otherwise our whole business is at risk. We are not sure why it is taking so long to get simple confirmation.“Although not one penny of the proposed subsidy comes to us, it goes directly to the passenger, we would be forced to pay it all back if it doesn’t comply, that could ruin us and we can’t take that risk. All we are asking for is for the Scottish Government to check that it’s legal with the EU and UK and then we can get on with it. We have written to the new Minister Michael Matheson MSP and invited him to visit the island and meet our staff so we can share our concerns with him directly and hopefully he will visit soon so we can get this unlocked.“We have also today asked for a meeting with our local MSP Liam McArthur to see if he can do anything to get things moving forward on our behalf.

That is simply not acceptable.Whatever the outstanding disagreement there may be between the government and commercial operators, Mr McArthur feels that people in Orkney have every right to expect both sides to get this sorted without delay.\u0026#8220The Transport Secretary also needs to confirm that the fare reductions, once agreed, will be backdated to 30 June, in keeping with the firm promises made by his predecessor and the First Minister,\u0026#8221 he said.“This sorry saga has rumbled on for far too long.

Blind from the age of seven as the result of smallpox, the legendary Blind Piper was a pupil of the great MacCrimmon of Skye, going on to compose perhaps the finest piobaireachd ever.The aim of the festival is to encourage pipers under the age of 18 to participate in friendly and relaxing competitions.

It also found that 62 per cent of posts are in professional occupations.Eilean Siar, Glasgow and Highland are the three areas with the highest number of jobs in which Gaelic is considered essential, together accounting for 93 per cent of the Scottish total.The study was welcomed by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, who commented that the growth in desirable and essential jobs making use of Gaelic language would provide young people with a wealth of exciting career choices.\"I hope that this report will encourage more people to consider learning Gaelic,\" he added.As well as looking at the demand for Gaelic language skills, the report looks at Gaelic education, analyses the opportunities and challenges, and suggests future action.Damien Yeates, chief Executive of SDS, said: \"Developing a detailed evidence base of current and future skills demand is essential for all parts of our economy, and the Gaelic language labour market is no exception.\"Last year SDS published the second edition of its Gaelic language plan, and this study was one of the key commitments contained in that plan.\"The evidence will help inform future investment aimed at promoting the Gaelic language and culture.\"Shona MacLennan, chief executive of B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig, commented: \"B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig is clear that growing the number of Gaelic-essential jobs and jobs which use Gaelic is important in ensuring that Gaelic is used more often, by more people and in a wider range of situations.\"The key challenge is to ensure that the flow of people with high quality Gaelic language skills entering the labour market is matched to the demand from employers across the public, private and third sectors, and from across Scotland.\"\u0026nbspFuture actions proposed in the report include forming a national group with responsibility for Gaelic language skills, and increased monitoring and evaluation of the activities supporting the language.Charlotte Wright, Chief Executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), said: \"Gaelic is fundamental to HIE\u0026rsquos unique remit which integrates economic and community development throughout the Highlands and Islands.\"Our support has helped numerous organisations which enable Gaelic to flourish, and we look forward to continuing to work with businesses, social enterprises and community organisations that can add value through using Gaelic to help realise its full potential.\"Monday 2 Jul 2018 2:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Most damaging of all, Loganair noted, was the announcement by Flybe that it was entering a new franchise agreement with Eastern Airways and would compete head-to-head on six routes.            Despite the turbulence, Loganair booked record turnover of £110.7m, a rise of 7 per cent. Passenger numbers were up 6.2 per cent to an all-time high of 812,541, but the load factor – the percentage of seats filled on scheduled flights – fell from 62.8 per cent to 59.8 per cent, due to the overcapacity on routes with Flybe competition. Just under 78 per cent of flights ran on time.Chairman David Harrison said: “This year’s results bring to an end 17 consecutive years in profit for Loganair, and the fact that we forecast last year that we would be loss-making in 2017/18 makes it no less painful.“The extent of the loss is a direct result of competition on six of our eight largest routes, and from the outset we maintained that the markets on these routes were simply not big enough to sustain the level of seat capacity being introduced. This indeed proved to the case.“However, these costs are non-recurring, and Loganair is now on the front foot and ready for a successful year ahead.”Managing director Jonathan Hinkles added: “In a challenging year, I’m delighted to say that the transition from franchise partner to an airline operating in its own right was completed on schedule.            “In the last 12 months we have transformed our operation with wholesale changes to our reservations, revenue accounting and check-in systems.“We have carried out a full rebrand, repainted our aircraft in tartan livery, introduced new crew and ground staff uniform, brought in a comprehensive system of service improvements for our customers and launched a significant sales and marketing programme.“I’m equally pleased to be able to report that the response from our customers to these developments has been extremely positive.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4754753.1528987528!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures how to make your own scottish morning rolls","story":"\t\tMorning rolls are one of Scotland\u0026#8217s best loved foods, Scottish food writer Fraser Wright provides a recipe on how to make your own.\t\t\t\tYou need to start these the night before you want to eat them, however they last well and toast very well too.            What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762286.1530442869!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures liam gallagher closes day 2 of trnsmt festival","story":"\t\tTens of thousands of music lovers once again flocked to a sold out Glasgow Green for day two of Scotland\u0026#8217s biggest music festival, and as TRNSMT fans bathed in glorious temperatures - with Glasgow reaching higher temperatures than Madrid \u0026#8211 acts like Gerry Cinnamon, Kyle Falconer, Courteeners and Krept and Konan took to the stage.\t\t\t\t• VIEW THE FULL GALLERY HERE            Kicking things off on the Main Stage were Glasgow’s very own The LaFontaines with frontman Kerr Okan delighting the crowd as the band made their second consecutive appearance at the festival.            Addressing the audience, Kerr Okan, said: “Glasgow you look so good in the sunshine! Thanks for watching us, you are part of this band!”Shed Seven followed with hits including ‘Disco Down’ and ‘Going for Gold’ as well as a cover of Stone Roses ‘I Am the Resurrection’ Krept x Konan, the London-based hip-hop duo who have seen a gradual rise to prominence over the last few years, took to the stage before the arrival  of possibly the most anticipated performance of TRNSMT’s first weekend - Gerry Cinnamon’s Main Stage set. Just one year ago the local star took to the King Tut’s Powered by Utilita Stage, now a year later thousands of fans displayed their adoration for the one man show with just an acoustic guitar the singer-songwriter from Castlemilk once again had the crowd eating out of his hands.             Fans over on the King Tut’s Powered by Utilita Stage were also treated to a strong line-up of both promising and established acts throughout the day, including openers The Night Café, BAS, The Academic, Scottish natives The Snuts and Kyle Falconer, who provided an insight into his upcoming solo album. Ramz and IAMDDB continued the party into the early evening, before The Sherlocks closed proceedings with their straight-down-the-line indie sound.As the evening rocked on, Wolf Alice’s performed hits such as ‘Silk’ and newer material including ‘Don’t Delete the Kisses’, before the Courteeners took the Main Stage.Ten years on from the release of their, now iconic, debut album St Jude, Courteeners wowed their fans with tunes like ‘Not Nineteen Forever’, ‘Notion’ and ‘Cavorting’.            Headline act Liam Gallagher then arrived stating: “So this is the famous Glasgow Green then? I’ve heard a lot about it.” The former Oasis frontman’s performance then documented his 25-year career as one of the country’s most popular figures, with solo tunes such as ‘Wall of Glass’ and ‘Greedy Soul’ tucked between Oasis classics such as ‘Morning Glory’ and ‘Wonderwall’.Geoff Ellis, Festival Director said: “Today has had so many highlights from the mass Shed Seven singalong to the absolute class of Liam Gallagher’s set. One of the biggest moments for me was watching local boy Gerry Cinnamon completely command the Main Stage in front of his biggest ever crowd. This felt like a real tipping point performance that people will be talking about for years to come.

I am a unionist with a lower case “u”.             By that I mean I am not committed to any one unionist party and am willing to give non-unionist parties a fair hearing if they apply liberal, low tax, small government policies in Scotland, because I believe these are what will most likely deliver as harmonious and prosperous a Scotland for the vast majority of its people as is practicably possible.            Nor do I support unionism because I think an independent Scotland could not succeed one just has to look at other smaller countries to see that if Denmark or Norway can do well then surely so could Scotland – if it lived within its means.No, I am unionist because I am at home with being Scottish and British. It was in my mother’s milk that I suckled on it was in my rearing through infancy and schooldays and my travelling around the UK as a youth and then an undergraduate. I have rejoiced in our rich and diverse cultural history during my British holidays, just as I enjoy the internal home nations’ rivalries or competition between Scotland’s cities or the Highlands and Lowlands. I can see the good in them and the faults in them, but I do see and feel a tangible unifying oneness, a bond that I cannot let go of.So when I see the bitter divisions that came out of the first independence referendum – the splitting of families, the loss of friends and the rising tide of implied or discreet threats, sometimes with genuine menace – then I fear what another independence referendum could do to our country. At the age of 60 this year, I do not think the psychological wounds of 2014 will be healed before I leave this Earth – were there to be a second referendum then I have absolutely no doubt it will be ugly and the scarring divisions that much greater. Yet I have to tell you I also believe there will be another and it will not be pretty, and whatever the outcome it will need real leadership to bring about a healing. Sadly, there are few leaders of any humility or calibre that I think could achieve such a highly desirable role.I believe there will be another independence referendum because all the signs point to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wishing and now needing it to be so, and for good or ill she will instigate it.             The original SNP strategy was that if, when in government, it could show a SNP-run Scotland was no worse or maybe even slightly better than the Labour-Liberal Democrat administrations before, then independence might not seem such an undesirable leap. On many issues this meant the SNP actually did very little it promised for instance, the council tax was not abolished in favour of a local income tax, nor were students loans written off.When in 2011 the SNP won its overall majority it still did not seek to frighten the horses for fear of losing potential supporters for independence. Other than centralising institutions (under the mistaken guise of saving money), public service reform was studiously avoided. Scotland was in stasis while the independence White Paper, Scotland’s Future, was published, and following the 55-45 defeat no ­serious public service reform has followed.The SNP is essentially averse to challenging the vested interests in health and education, for to do so must force some people to be against them when they need to build a coalition for Yes (or more likely “Leave”) the second time round.After 11 years of SNP government we are therefore at a point where, under its watch, education is much worse with falling numeracy and literacy and collapsing international rankings expose the truth of this the Scottish NHS too is failing with the worst cancer treatment times in history and four health boards now requiring emergency loans totalling over £70 million just to get by meanwhile the iconic Queensferry Crossing yet again requires further remedial work that will disrupt traffic all summer and our public roads now have more craters than the surface of the Moon.             These are just some examples, for when you turn over any Scottish Government stone the problems come crawling out like clipshears and wood lice.Last week Sturgeon had a shambolic ministerial reshuffle that was bad on two counts. Firstly, she appointed a narcissist tweeter with a criminal conviction as Justice Secretary, when the role requires a solemn and judicious politician with a character, like Caesar’s wife, that is beyond suspicion. Secondly she not only retained her financial secretary, Derek Mackay, who has presided over a growing black hole that no quantum physicist can explain, she actually added to his brief. Ultimately this void will swallow up her government. Then she retained her Education Secretary, John Swinney, when by the evidence of his own inactions he has utterly failed to deliver the necessary reforms for what is claimed to be her “number one priority” of schooling.That was before the wheels came of the reshuffle tea trolley with the withdrawal of Gillian Martin as education minister.             The strategy for a second independence referendum was originally to use any and every grievance with Westminster – and where none existed, to create some – so momentum for a referendum could then be held. That is clearly not working. Nor by 20,000 leagues is the original model of demonstrating competence.All that is now left is for Sturgeon to take us into a second referendum – with or without Westminster’s necessary legal consent – so she can polarise the country and thus galvanise personal support to have any chance of the SNP remaining the largest party after the next Holyrood elections in 2021.Glorious victory – or more likely, glorious defeat whatever the cost to Scotland – is worth it if it means remaining in control of government. No longer is a second referendum about winning independence, it is about retaining power. Scotland will be thrown to the wolves to whip up division so in the aftermath disappointed supporters will flock to the SNP. Sturgeon cares not for the country’s harmony, prosperity or public services – she cares only for the SNP being in position to have a third tilt at independence.Such is the sorry state of our nation.

But an MSP wants Souness, 65, to abandon the multi-­million-pound project after the company submitted plans to build 2,600 homes on the sprawling site.            In a letter to the former Ibrox boss, Scottish Conservative MSP Graham Simpson said: “I urge you to reconsider destroying this protected piece of green space.”Campaign group Save Woodhall and Faskine said the development will ruin “irreplaceable” countryside, harm wildlife and cause pollution.But Mr Simpson also believes preserving the site is important for the health of local residents.In his letter to Souness, Mr Simpson adds: “You will be aware of the site and its importance both environmentally and culturally.“What you may not be so aware of is its significance to the local community and their health and wellbeing.            “However, as a former sportsman I am certain that people’s physical and mental health are at the forefront of your thoughts.“Scottish Government figures show that in 2016, 65 per cent of adults over the age of 16 were overweight and 29 per cent were obese. “I am sure you would agree that these are shocking statistics. The value of green space to people’s health and wellbeing is well-documented.“Unfortunately, if this application gets approval we will be losing open space and woodland.”            Souness’s son Fraser Souness, 37, and Scott Gillespie, 44, are directors of Orchard Brae Ltd which has applied to build on the land between the villages of Carnbroe and ­Calderbank.Their company – 40.5 per cent owned by the Souness family – lodged its application with North Lanarkshire Council last month. The company previously received a loan from a company owned by Scotland’s richest woman Ann Gloag. The land is owned by two daughters of former Conservative home secretary Willie Whitelaw.The plans also include shops, educational and leisure facilities, restaurants, a pub, a garden centre and a hotel.A 3,000-signature petition opposing development was presented to Holyrood in March when Mr Simpson led a debate calling for the greenbelt to be saved.

The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"health board in talks for better airport waiting area in aberdeen ","story":"NHS Shetland has been in talks to look at an alternative waiting area for patients flying back from Aberdeen Airport – rather than what has been described by a councillor as \u0026#8220a drafty corridor\u0026#8221.\nHealth board chief executive Ralph Roberts raised the issue during a Zetland Transport Partnership meeting on Tuesday afternoon.\nMr Roberts said there had been discussions with Loganair to look an alternative and he was having more talks about the matter on Friday.\nHe said there had been a suggestion that NHS Shetland should be obliged to pay for a lounge for passengers, but added in his own view it was a matter for all passengers travelling to Shetland.\nMr Roberts argued if the waiting area were adequate for all passengers it would be adequate for patients too.\nZetTrans chairman Ryan Thomson thanked Mr Roberts for bringing it to members\u0026#8217 attention.\nMr Thomson added \u0026#8220it\u0026#8217s a drafty corridor\u0026#8221, the issue had been raised at other transport meetings and Loganair was aware of the issue.\n\n \u0026raquo\nYet again, this is just so typical.
