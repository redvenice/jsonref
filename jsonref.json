Elizabeth, then still a Princess, has her second child with Philip. Princess Anne, the couple\u0027s only daughter, was born on August 15. The photos are being sold at Rowley\u0027s auction house in Ely, Cambridgeshire, with estimates of between £100 and £150 per card         1951: Although King George died in February 1952, the Queen had taken over many of her father\u0027s Royal duties months before and the 1951 card is the first to be signed by her and Philip. The Duke of Edinburgh and Princess Elizabeth went on a tour of Canada in the autumn of 1951. Their Christmas card used this photo of adoring crowds cheering on the royal couple         1952: This Christmas card saw the first appearance of Charles and Anne. 1952 was a tumultuous year for the royal family. In February, Princess Elizabeth and her husband Prince Philip, set out on a tour of Africa and Asia in place of her ailing father King George VI. George died on February 6         1954: This picture shows Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip with Charles and Anne on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. The year before, Queen Elizabeth was crowned at Westminster Abbey in the first televised coronation service         1955: Back to Balmoral with Charles and Anne. This photo is believed to have been taken in the summer and shows the royal family enjoying their summer vacation at Balmoral.

On Christmas Day in 1956, The Duke of Edinburgh was away from home on a voyage around the Commonwealth on the Britannia. Prince Philip spoke on the radio from the Royal yacht before The Queen made her Christmas broadcast live from her study in Sandringham, Norfolk         1957: The first Christmas card to be in colour, it shows the royal family outdoors, enjoying the sunshine. A young Prince Charles is pictured playing with the Queen\u0027s beloved dogs. They seem to be Dorgis, a mix between her famous Welsh Pembroke Corgis and a Dachshund. The Queen\u0027s 1957 Christmas Broadcast was an historic event, as it was the first to be televised. It was also the 25th anniversary of the first Christmas Broadcast on the radio         1958: Instead of a photo of the royal family, they shared a religious art scene in the 1958 Christmas card. The Holy Family with Saint Elizabeth, Saint John the Baptist and an Angel, painted by Sebastiano Ricci was the painting included. This biblical scene is most likely to be the \u0027Return from Egypt\u0027, when according to legend, the meeting of the Holy Family with St. John the Baptist took place. It was acquired by George III in 1762         1959: Despite switching to colour in previous years, the black and white made a return in 1959, with the Christmas card depicting Charles and Anne with the Queen and Prince Philip. The Queen\u0027s Christmas Broadcast in 1959 took the form of a prerecorded radio message instead of a television broadcast. The Queen was pregnant with her third child, Prince Andrew, at the time, who was born the following February         1960: In this Christmas card, Prince Andrew makes his first appearance, with one of the Queen\u0027s beloved Corgis also being included. In her Christmas Broadcast of 1960, he Queen spoke from Buckingham Palace, and described an eventful year. The Queen gave birth to her third son, Prince Andrew, in February Princess Margaret married Anthony Armstrong-Jones in May and Nigeria gained its independence while remaining part of the Commonwealth. She also talked about an earthquake in Morocco which killed 12,000 people the deaths of 69 protesters in a massacre in Sharpeville, South Africa and an explosion in a Welsh pit in Monmouthshire which killed 45 miners         1961: This year saw another painting of the Holy Family used instead of the royals. This one was painted by Sir Peter Paul Reubens. This scene shows the Christ Child standing on the lap of the Virgin, who sits with her mother, St Anne, and husband, St Joseph, behind. It\u0027s unclear when it was bought, but it was probably obtained by George I in 1723         1964: Prince Edward makes his first appearance. Prince Edwards was the Queen and Prince Philip\u0027s last child. The Queen\u0027s Christmas Broadcast in 1964 addressed the important role of the Commonwealth in a year in which anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela was jailed in South Africa, and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru diedThe following year they bizarrely included a speedboat in the family photo, with all six of them roaring with laughter.In 1970 they sent a photo of the Royal Yacht Britannia in Sydney Harbour, a nod to a Royal tour of Australia that year to mark the bi-centenary anniversary of James Cook\u0027s first voyage Down Under.In 1971 and 1972 they included family photos with all the members in high spirits.The photos are being sold at Rowley\u0027s auction house in Ely, Cambridgeshire, with estimates of between £100 and £150 per card.         1965: The family look in high spirits in this photo, with Prince Edward in the pram and an excited Prince Andrew playing with him. The photo is a poignant one with the Queen focusing on the importance of family in 1965. The Queen\u0027s Christmas Broadcast in 1965 took as its theme the family, from the inidual unit to the family of man. It was broadcast from Buckingham Palace         1966: Colour finally returns to the family photo this year - as does the Queen\u0027s beloved Corgi. This was also the year that women\u0027s issues came to the forefront and the Queen, in her Christmas Broadcast of 1966, in a decade which saw great changes for women, spoke about the increasingly prominent and important role played by women in society. The contraceptive pill was launched in 1961 and abortion would be legalised in the UK, for women who were up to 24 weeks pregnant, in 1967         1968: The young family together, with Corgi in tow, in a spring photo that was used for that year\u0027s Christmas card. The Queen\u0027s Christmas Broadcast for 1968 - the year in which civil rights leader Martin Luther King was shot dead in Memphis - took the theme of brotherhood. It was filmed in Buckingham Palace. It was a dramatic year for the Queen, with a book claiming she had to talk relative Lord Mountbatten out of leading a plot to overthrow a Labour government in 1968. Lord Mountbatten, Prince Charles\u0027 great uncle and mentor, came close to leading a group of industrialists, generals and tycoons in the coup to replace then Prime Minister Harold Wilson         1969: The family are enjoying a speedboat on board the HMY Britannia. For the only time in The Queen\u0027s reign to date, there was no televised Christmas Broadcast in 1969.  This was because a special documentary film - \u0027Royal Family\u0027 - had been made during the summer in connection with the Investiture of The Prince of Wales. It was therefore decided not to do a broadcast at Christmas, but The Queen issued a written message instead. In 1968, the Queen allowed cameras to follow the family for the ground-breaking BBC television documentary, Royal Family, a two-hour special that was watched by 40 million people around the world when it aired in 1969. However, the Queen has never allowed it to be shown since         1970: No photo of the family, instead the Christmas card showed HMY Britannia leaving Sydney harbour in Australia. This year, the televised Christmas Broadcast made a return. 1970 marked the 200th anniversary of the voyage of Captain Cook \u0027discovering\u0027 Australia. The Queen\u0027s Christmas Broadcast that year recounted some of the trips made by The Queen earlier in the year. It included film shot in Australia, New Zealand and Canada         1971: A colour photo of the royal family. The Queen\u0027s Christmas Broadcast in 1971 focused on the theme of families. The television version showed Prince Andrew and Prince Edward looking at a family photograph album         1972: The final card in the collection, this colourful photograph shows the entire family enjoying themselves outside. They look happy and relaxed in the photo, which was sent out in the Christmas card. A momentous year, the Queen and Prince Philip celebrated 25 years of marriage, and the Queen\u0027s Christmas Broadcast that year included scenes from the celebration. The year also saw terrible violence in Northern Ireland, and preparations for Britain to join the European Economic Community.

They explain how our toxic political climate made them take a stand against inidualismThe idea came to them in June. The Turner prize nominees had arrived in Margate to visit the Turner Contemporary. The four artists – Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Oscar Murillo, Tai Shani – had never met before and, as they talked in a white-walled meeting room facing the North Sea, they began to discuss proposing themselves to the judges as a collective. Their idea was, in other words, that there should be no single winner of this year’s Turner prize. It was a plan for a hijack – albeit, says Cammock, “a considered hijack”.“I don’t remember who said it out loud first,” says Shani, whose sensuous, voluptuous work for the prize’s exhibition combines performance, text and installation to imagine a post-patriarchal world. “We’d all thought about it. For me, it felt like being nominated was a huge recognition. I was really happy with that. When someone suggested it, we were very cohesive immediately.”Murillo – who is showing an unsettling installation of papier-mache figures staring out to sea, their view all but blocked by a dark curtain – says: “If any of us had inidually won, I would have felt I was betraying my own work and ideas – if we are indeed really talking about solidarity.”Abu Hamdan quickly understood that although his fellow shortlisted artists use very different aesthetic tools from him, they have much in common – an interest in power and agency, exclusion and oppression. “If anyone gets what we do as inidual artists, they will get why this decision had to be made,” he says. His films in the show arise from a project to collect aural memories from survivors of the infamous Saydnaya prison in Syria – memories that in practical terms helped researchers reconstruct the conditions of incarceration but also, in their distortions and metaphorical layerings, allowed the artist to mine a deeper, poetic understanding of these horrific experiences.“There was something about the way we work and why we work that resonated,” remembers Cammock, who is showing a film about women’s resistance and protest in Derry during the Troubles. “We started to talk about the toxic political environment and it felt like it was a moment we could start doing something about that, between us – however that worked or manifested.”As their eventual joint statement puts it, they believed that pitting themselves against each other “would undermine our inidual artistic efforts to show a world entangled. The issues we each deal with are as inseparable as climate chaos is from capitalism.” Proposing themselves as a collective, as an act of resistance, would be a symbolic gesture. Symbolism is, of course, the great tool of the artist – and the Turner prize, for the British artist, is the most prominent platform from which to deploy it.This coup was, says Shani, “actually quite a bureaucratic process. We didn’t have very high hopes of it going through. This idea of Mutiny on the Bounty – that wasn’t quite how it panned out.”They made a proposal to Tate Britain, which runs the prize, in the summer and it wound its way up to the trustees before being offered to the jurors as an option. They weren’t at all sure it would be accepted. The jurors met as usual on Tuesday, the day of the announcement, and were free to ignore what the artists had suggested – though realistically, there wasn’t much moral wriggle-room. So they accepted and the artists will split the prize money equally, £10,000 each.At the prize ceremony, in Margate’s art deco Dreamland amusement park, Cammock read the full statement – the most political Turner prize speech in years, a sustained attack on the Conservatives’ politics of austerity and exclusion. To slam the point home, Shani was sporting an enormous pendant bearing the slogan: “TORIES OUT.” She talked of an increasingly narrow idea of “Britishness” offered by the right. As Abu Hamdan put it the morning after: “There’s a disconnect between being accepted as a British artist culturally – and being put on the highest platform of what it means to be a British artist – and the ‘hostile environment’.”This feels personal to all of them. Abu Hamdan has a British passport but lives in Beirut partly because of the difficulties of settling his Lebanese wife in Britain. Murillo, who was born in Colombia, once flushed his British passport down an aeroplane loo in a moment of rebellion against the privilege the document confers. Shani, who is Jewish, talks about how she feels “antisemitism has been manipulated by the right. There’s a feeling that you are being instrumentalised and that people are speaking on behalf of your identity in the name of protecting you.” Cammock feels that the current climate of ision and racism is “a resurgence of something toxically dangerous, like a wave that keeps rising”.Should artists be getting into this kind of territory? Well, why not? All art is political. But the other point these artists press home is that they also live in the real world. Their work is not magically disconnected from their lives and opinions, and the society in which they live. “I’ve been vocal about my financial precarity,” says Shani, who has posted on social media about how she’s feared having to give up working as an artist because of the difficulty of making ends meet. “People ask me,” chips in Cammock, “about how the arts can become more inclusive spaces for people who don’t come from wealthy backgrounds. But art isn’t isolated from society. If people are excluded from other things, they will also be excluded from the arts.”Shani continues: “If people aren’t paid properly in the arts then people can’t be artists.” Cammock: “And if it’s being taken out of state education and becomes something for privileged private schools.” Shani: “Then there’s higher education, tuition fees. Everything is related. We are part of society.”You could reasonably ask: if the artists had been so eager to disrupt the rules of the Turner prize, why did they allow their nominations to go forward in the first place? They had the choice and many – mostly famously Sarah Lucas – have turned down the chance over the years. The artists all say they are honoured to have been shortlisted, and their decision was contingent on the synergies between them – another combination, in another year, and it wouldn’t have happened.But also, points out Cammock, this isn’t an isolated incident. Look at the history of sport. “There have been many moments when people have taken a stand – moments where people have seen the interconnectedness between things and have made a decision. They run across the line together. They do the black power salute.” Abu Hamdan pitches in: “And there’s Kaepernick” – referring to the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who took the knee during The Star-Spangled Banner as a protest against racism. “We are not in an isolated bubble,” says Cammock. “We are people too.”We are in a moment when the traditional cultural authority of the arts prize – with its single “genius” winner – is being challenged. More and more victors of prizes (Helen Marten, for example, who won the Turner in 2016) are choosing to share out the prize money with their fellow nominees. In the case of the Booker prize this year, it was the judges who refused to observe the rules, presenting Bernardine Evaristo and Margaret Atwood as joint winners in defiance of the organisers.Shani sees this as part of a wider shift – a mood of unpicking authority, of seeing through the accepted matrices of power and questioning them. It is possible that the world is moving beyond the monolithic, winner-takes-all prize – increasingly people are questioning the act that holds up one artist as the best. In the present case, it’s hard not to fall for the sincerity of these four artists who, without cynicism, have expressed their beliefs and hopes through the means at their disposal.“What did Audre Lorde say?” says Cammock, in reference to the American poet and activist. “‘Your silence will not protect you.’ This is a moment of saying no to silence.”• The Turner prize exhibition is at Turner Contemporary, Margate, until 12 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afd28dbe157b0d025f9dd45d5cf0bccb7f83a5ec/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec3f73fabe2209bed3c60e7809754824","title":"quiz are you a born adventurer","story":" Everyone likes to think they’ve got an adventurous side … who hasn’t dreamed of escaping the everyday and taking on a new challenge?

They perform best at different times of the day and at different times of the year.”Scottish Power is developing more than 1,000MW of new onshore wind capacity, however the UK will need to build at least this capacity of onshore wind every year for the next three decades if it hopes to meet its 2050 climate targets, according to the Committee on Climate Change.Anderson said: “In the next 18 months I believe hybrids will be the new normal for all renewable energy developers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16610c88ab90b461028d1220028b59533101920f/0_0_1920_1281/master/1920.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f1b3e80f89d712e804e6d5dd0b33c7c7","title":"french workers cherish welfare state strike reforms macron","story":"It’s shaping up to be one of France’s biggest strikes in recent memory. Responding to calls from unions to protest against the government’s proposed retirement reforms, an impressive swath of the workforce plans to walk off the job tomorrow – everyone from railway workers and truckers to judges, nurses, teachers and students.While it has yet to introduce legislation, Emmanuel Macron’s government has floated a proposal that would mark the deepest overhaul of France’s pension system since its creation in the aftermath of the second world war. This would effectively hike the earliest age at which one can collect so-called full retirement benefits from 62 to 64, overhaul the formula for calculating benefits and merge the country’s 42 existing pension schemes into a single regime – all in all, resulting in likely benefit cuts for millions. Authorities have defended their ambitions with the language of French republicanism, vowing to forge a “universal system” in which everyone is treated equally. But what they neglect to mention is that the new standard would be worse than today’s.Predictably, the French government has sought to paint opposition to retirement reform as “corporatist” – an unhelpful backlash from pockets of workers aiming to preserve their own advantages, along with the usual bunch of hardline trade unionists. And indeed, the call to strike initially came from militant railway workers with relatively good benefits. But it has since spread elsewhere: to state schoolteachers, hospital staffers, postal workers and employees of the state electricity provider. Student unions and groups of gilets jaunes (yellow vests) looking to re-energise their year-long protest movement have also joined the cause. Those planning to protest appear increasingly like a cross-section of French society, brought together by a shared goal. A poll published on Wednesday found that nearly six in 10 people support the strike.Sympathy for the strike has been fuelled by frustrations over Macron’s broader economic record. Retirement reform is only his latest effort to chip away at the welfare state. Since taking office in 2017, the president has also slashed unemployment benefits and made it easier for companies to fire workers, while keeping a tight lid on the cost of public services.At the same time, he has replaced the country’s wealth tax – which once applied to all those with €1.3m in assets – with a tax on property holdings valued above that level. As the gilets jaunes expressed in such dramatic fashion, ordinary French people are increasingly forced to make sacrifices while the super-rich get government handouts.If there is a unifying thread behind Macronism – a vision that links these various reforms – it is the notion that France must be made more attractive for business. This has always been an obsession of the nation’s top employers’ lobby, the Movement of the Enterprises of France. But it’s only grown since the 1980s, when France’s neighbours began pursuing pro-business reforms at a much brisker pace. Regretful that they never had a Reagan or Thatcher of their own, much of France’s commercial elite now share a sense that their country is economically backwards: that there’s too much red tape, too many pro-worker rules, that state spending unfairly crowds out the private sector. The pension system is emblematic of these frustrations: where retirees see a source of hard-won benefits, bosses and reformers see a costly dinosaur fed by payroll taxes.It’s hard to have much sympathy for those who are whining. After all, France still has the world’s sixth largest economy, and the rich have no problem making money here. There are more than 40 billionaires last year, France’s companies paid out more idends to shareholders than anywhere else in continental Europe.But more importantly, France can boast one of the most successful welfare states in the world. That’s a major reason why the country has a lower poverty rate than its often-idealised American, British and German counterparts. The safety net also helped soften the blow of the last economic crisis, a lesson that authorities would do well to remember as the global economy slows down.Protesters in France will probably be derided as unrealistic, as stubborn defenders of an old-fashioned model in need of change. What’s actually far more outdated in 2019 is Macron’s insistence on chipping away at an effective and popular social welfare programme. One need only look at the state of the countries that French business elites look up to with such fondness. On paper, the UK and US might be more economically competitive than France, but at what cost? Can anyone truly say that neoliberal reforms have made them better countries to live in?In this case, like so many others, the people on the streets in France will carry far more wisdom than the national assembly or the Elysée palace. The country’s welfare state is a world-class achievement that ought to be protected, not hollowed out for savings.• Cole Stangler is a journalist based in Paris"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fecef4010a35e87095ca07c47d6ebb7e2d12c63d/0_122_3919_2350/master/3919.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8aa81b960d9a3abaea26a59102a849f5","title":"queer representation strictly im a celebrity homophobia caitlyn jenner","story":"I keep thinking of the same joke. Imagine getting to a point in Strictly Come Dancing, a competition built on a sparkly tower of sequins and shimmies, a show that had its regular musicals week last weekend, and thinking, no, that bit is just too gay for me to stomach. Bring me the telephone, Steve, there’s homosexual activity on my ballroom dancing show.Last month, Johannes Radebe and Graziano di Prima danced together in the show’s first complete same-sex dance in its 15-year history. Around 200 or so people had enough of an issue with it to formally complain, with another 100 adding their objections over the last few days. It boggles the mind that two men dancing can provoke any kind of upset, that it appears to have infuriated people who watch Strictly makes it all the more baffling. Last week, Craig Revel Horwood opened musicals week by dragging up, climbing aboard a giant cake and belting out Hello Dolly (“wow, wow, wow, fellas  look at the old girl now, fellas”). It was left open to viewers’ interpretation whether it was a direct response to the complaints of the week before.Television’s other ratings juggernaut, I’m A Celebrity … Get Me Out Of Here!, has had its first transgender contestant this year in Caitlyn Jenner. Say what you will about Jenner’s politics, but she has emerged as the kind of 70-year-old woman who will happily roll up her sleeves and get stuck in to the bushtucker trials. When she first went into the jungle, social media was a cesspit of transphobic posts and unfunny, knuckle-dragging attempts at humour. The extent of it was shocking and horrible. But on the show itself, her presence has been quietly significant. Jenner talked openly and honestly with her fellow contestants about transitioning, about why she did so when she did. Perhaps there is something about that environment that encourages frankness, but to see her talk about her life, as privileged as it is, without any sort of salacious spin put on it by outside forces, was refreshing. Less splashy, but as important, was Adele Roberts, who left the jungle first, and was greeted by her girlfriend on the bridge with a kiss. It was a tiny detail, but again, the everyday normality of it mattered.Many LGBTQ viewers seek out characters that are like them in drama and comedy. In the age of streaming, and with the avalanche of prestige television, this is easier than it has ever been because there are more queer characters than we have ever seen before. There’s a niche Netflix drama for everyone. Reality TV feels different. Strictly and I’m a Celebrity cross generations of viewers. They still bring in the numbers like no other shows can. They are universal, event television, family shows. They set the public conversation. While a minority of their viewers might take issue with the inclusion of people who identify as LGBTQ, the fact that most have no problem with it is heartening.I can laugh about a small proportion of the audience feeling confused as they navigate the campness of Strictly while also feeling something funny about two men dancing closely (maybe it’s homophobia, but maybe it’s just desire, Steve). However, it remains upsetting that this has to be discussed at all. When Hungary has upped its anti-LGBTQ rhetoric by pulling out of the Eurovision song contest – billed by a pro-government journalist as a “homosexual flotilla” that might damage the mental health of the public – it is a reminder that to be queer, right now, is to feel unsettled. Populism is not our friend. Nor is Britain’s prime minister who still refuses to see any issue with calling gay men “tank-topped bumboys”, who once objected to Labour “encouraging the teaching of homosexuality in schools”. Television shows such as Strictly and I’m A Celebrity have a part to play in what we see as the makeup of our society. For the most mainstream of television programmes to be contributing to the visibility of LGBTQ people is something, but there has to be more, until two men can dance together on primetime and it prompts no complaints at all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26771800712523a9192a165fd67cdb97544afa4a/0_369_5542_3326/master/5542.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15236dd71b6466a3da0a0db60299303e","title":"british columbia the ultimate 10 day itinerary","story":"From the depths of the Pacific to the peaks of the Rockies – this region of Canada offers an adventure at every turn, from mountain-biking and snowboarding to amazing local foodDays one and two: The Gulf IslandsWith this 10-day itinerary you’ll be flying in and out the multicultural seaport city of Vancouver. Forty-five minutes from downtown Vancouver is Tsawwassen terminal, where a 55-minute ferry crossing takes you to Galiano Island, a 17-mile stretch of forest and beaches that lies off the coast of Vancouver Island. Here, eagles swoop overhead and whales flip their tails through the strait of Active Pass. Feast on local produce at Pilgrimme in a wooden cabin under the cedars. Hike the Tapovan trail, dedicated to world peace advocate Sri Chinmoy, or paddle a kayak from Montague Harbour Marina.While smaller islands are reached by private boat or chartered seaplane service, Salt Spring Island is a 45-minute journey from Galiano by BC Ferries. You can soak up the famously laid-back vibes by browsing farmers’ markets, hiking Mount Maxwell, taking a drop-in kundalini yoga class and snacking on the deliciously creamy local goat’s milk cheese.Days three and four: Vancouver IslandHead to the main affair, Vancouver Island, and make for Port Renfrew with its unspoiled beaches, storm-blasted Sitka spruce, and dense forests. See “Canada’s gnarliest tree” in Avatar Grove, hike the Botanical Beach Loop Trail on a boardwalk through old-growth forest to the black basalt and sandstone beach.

Since climate models have accurately anticipated global temperature changes so far, we can expect projections of future warming to be reliable as well.The research examines the accuracy of 17 models published over the past five decades, beginning with a 1970 study and including 1981 and 1988 models led by James Hansen, the former Nasa climatologist who testified to the US Senate in 1988 about the impacts of anthropogenic global heating. The study also includes the first four reports by the UN’s intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC).“We found that climate models – even those published back in the 1970s – did remarkably well, with 14 out of the 17 model projections indistinguishable from what actually occurred,” said Zeke Hausfather, of the University of California, Berkeley, and lead author of the paper.Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950sLyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API\u0026nbspwarned\u0026nbspthe industry: “Time is running out.”Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases.A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”.The Nasa scientist\u0026nbspJames Hansen testifies to the US Senate\u0026nbspthat “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.”A\u0026nbspconfidential report\u0026nbspprepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states.Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies\u0026nbspestablish\u0026nbspthe Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions.Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research.Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”.At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.”Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out\u0026nbspan ad in The New York Times\u0026nbsptitled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.”The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC.The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose\u0026nbspmain donors\u0026nbspare in the oil and gas industry,\u0026nbspleads\u0026nbspthe “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which\u0026nbspends in disarray.A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals\u0026nbsp90 companies\u0026nbspare responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century.The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry.Exxon, Chevron and BP each\u0026nbspdonate at least $500,000\u0026nbspfor the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the\u0026nbspbiggest threat\u0026nbspto the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming.Based on modern climate model projections, if countries follow through with current and pledged climate policies, the world is on track for about 3C of warming above pre-industrial temperatures by 2100 – a situation the IPCC and others predict would be catastrophic.The challenge in evaluating climate model accuracy lies in the fact that due to computing power limitations, simulations are only run for a few specific future greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. There are an infinite number of such possible scenarios, but real-world emissions will follow only one path, and it will never exactly match the few scenarios input into climate models. Thus, if Earth warms less than in a climate model projection, it does not necessarily mean the model was inaccurate.Put simply, climate scientists are not in the business of predicting human fossil fuel consumption but are attempting to accurately simulate how the climate will change in response to a given rise in greenhouse gas emissions.“Future emissions depend on human behaviour, not physical systems, and climate models should be evaluated on their physics rather than the future emission projections,” said Hausfather.In nearly half of the model projections examined in the paper, the input scenarios were significantly different from the real-world changes in greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, projected temperature changes were only consistent with observed global warming in 10 of the 17 models, with four projecting more warming and three projecting less than subsequently occurred.However, the study authors addressed these inconsistencies by evaluating the change in temperature per change in “radiative forcing” – the global energy imbalance caused by the increased greenhouse effect and other factors – in models against what happened in the real world. This metric reveals whether the climate models are accurately producing the temperature response to a given emissions change – in essence, whether are accurately simulating the physical response of Earth’s climate system. With this factored in, 14 of the 17 models were accurate.“The rate of warming we are experiencing today is pretty much exactly what past climate models projected it would be,” said Hausfather.Those who oppose policies to limit the impacts of global heating have long sought to undermine the credibility of climate models. If the model projections are considered unreliable, they argue, then we do not know how urgent slowing global warming is. As a result, “climate models are unreliable” has become a popular myth propagated by climate deniers.The latest study adds to the body of evidence supporting the accuracy of climate models, and will be welcomed by those arguing that more aggressive climate policies are needed to avoid dangerous levels of global warming. The UN climate summit in Glasgow in 2020 will be crucial, as countries will be expected to commit to scaling up the emission reductions that were pledged in the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4714e7b1561f09615e6ac9120bfeee40e0ee614b/0_188_5404_3243/master/5404.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af4a27a43e383243767a0be436adfbed","title":"no regrets activists who shut down power plant await sentence","story":"Members of WeShutDown stand trial for blockading the Weisweiler plant. Some call it ‘ecoterrorism’, while others label it a masterstroke in the art of protestA group of climate activists who shut down a lignite coal power plant in Germany said they had no regrets and were prepared to repeat the action, as they awaited the conclusion of their trial.The activists from the group WeShutDown blockaded the Weisweiler power plant near Aachen for several hours on 15 November 2017, by halting its coal-carrying conveyor belts and diggers. The energy company RWE, which owns the plant, claims the shutdown cost it €2m.The group has called its action “legitimate and necessary”, claiming that it stopped significant amounts of emissions from entering the atmosphere.“We prevented 26,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions which would otherwise have been pumped out in the several hours we shut it down,” one of the activists, going by the alias Wanja, said. “That’s the equivalent of the amount of electricity used by 2,672 people in Germany in one year, or 104,000 people in Tanzania.”The group, he said, “created a moment of effective opposition to this infernal machine – lignite is also one of the most ineffective fuels there is, only economically viable if produced on a huge scale.“By bringing it to a halt, we reduced the damaging emissions it produces, so it was legitimate and the opposite of criminal. We are convinced it was worth it.”The 37-year-old Wanja, along with four other activists on trial in Eschweiler, faces charges of trespassing and disturbance of public supply in a case that has received widespread publicity. Their act has been labelled ecoterrorism and industrial sabotage by some, while others consider it a masterstroke in the history of environmental protest in Germany.The accused are unlikely to face prison sentences, but could receive hefty fines when the judge delivers his verdict, expected on Wednesday.The activists said they want the publicity given to their trial to have the effect of putting pressure on the German government to act faster to phase out coal mining, which it has pledged to do over the next 20 years.WeShutDown has said it had made use of the trial, which started on 29 October, to highlight “the worldwide destruction of livelihoods through lignite coal combustion”.Its lawyers asked the court to hear statements from climate emergency experts to illustrate that their action was justified in Germany and beyond, because “air pollution is local, but climate change is global”.Rosa Gierens, a Finnish meteorologist from the University of Cologne, who is an expert on air pollution and specifically on how fine particles emitted from power plants affect human health, told the court that peer-reviewed statistical data proved that Weisweiler “caused 280 premature deaths every year”.The global impact was to be illustrated by a Tanzanian farmer, due to give evidence on how the power plant, by contributing to the climate emergency, had affected the livelihoods of people in his country.Seuri Sanare, 28, a member of the Masai community from Monduli in northern Tanzania, was refused the chance to speak.But he told the  that had he been given the chance, he would have explained to the court the devastating effects, including the lack of rain and resultant loss of grass and livestock on his community.“The knock-on effects are multiple,” he said. “People are having to go much further for water for both cattle and humans, at considerable risk to both.“Land is splitting due to the parched conditions,” he said, showing photographs of huge rifts that had formed in agricultural land near his home. “In turn this leads to social unrest as neighbours dispute whose land is whose,” he said.Women in particular were among the most vulnerable, he said. “They are having to get up earlier and earlier to go further and further for that water for their families, and because it’s often still dark, they regularly face rape en route and are vulnerable to sexual exploitation in exchange for water, particularly in the cities.”Wanja said the court’s refusal to hear Sanare as a witness, illustrated “that German justice is more interested in German suffering, but not suffering elsewhere in the world”.He recalled the night in November when he and 12 other ecological activists finally embarked on the action they had been planning for months. They had broken the skin on their fingertips sealing the ridges with superglue to avoid leaving fingerprints, and some were wearing nappies in anticipation of a long night’s sit-in. Wanja said that as he was running towards the power plant, he fell and broke his ankle. “But I continued, hardly feeling the pain probably because of the adrenalin,” he said.The group climbed over the fence “with surprising ease – there was very little to keep us out”, he said. They made it to the plant, activating the emergency stop buttons on the conveyor belts. Some of the activists chained themselves together on the conveyor belts, others on mechanical diggers, while Wanja climbed up on a tripod they had placed five metres above the tracks, unfurled a banner reading “Never Trust a COP” – a reference to the UN climate change summit that was taking place in Bonn at the same time – and settled himself into a hammock, listening as the plant literally ground to a halt around him.“I wasn’t scared,” Wanja recalled. “I was overwhelmed by a sense of intense relief that we had achieved what we’d set out to do, and relished the hours it took for them to extract us, knowing the longer it took, the more effective our action was going to have been.”A spokesman for RWE condemned the activists’ action, saying there was no question that they should be held criminally culpable for what it sees as an act of sabotage. “Just as if someone were to unauthorisedly break into someone’s private house and cause damages there, there would be a demand for compensation, so it’s the same in this case,” he said.He said accusations that the company itself was doing damage by producing energy lacked substance: “The company is producing electricity with a plant and equipment which have been erected and are being operated in accordance with democratic decisions and state approval. The company said the activists’ blockade had led to a loss in performance of more than 2,000 megawatts, forcing the company to buy in replacement supplies on the energy exchange."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/beb48d6ec19c0ad547dcc2f527fb62ab1198f7d0/0_296_2471_1482/master/2471.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8880c8cdc5f173cead765ccff348938c","title":"wildlife photographer of year lumix people choice shortlist 2019 in pictures","story":"Fans of wildlife photographs can pick their favourite for the Lumix-sponsored award from 25 images pre-selected by the Natural History Museum in London.

Her biographer Charles Moore called it a “sceptre of her rule” and others have described them as part of her “Iron Lady” armoury, her secret weapon with which to deliver stern “handbaggings” to some of the men in her cabinet.When the show was first revealed in July the curators expressed a desire to borrow a Thatcher bag because none were in its collections of her outfits. It has now secured a loan from the Museum of Bags, in Amsterdam, of a grey Asprey bag which was made in the early 1980s and regularly carried by her while in power.The museum does have examples of her clothes, donated in 2016 by Thatcher’s twin children Carol and Mark – power dressing ensembles which include a royal-blue Aquascutum suit with shoulder pads and a matching blouse that she wore as she voted in the 1987 election.That donation followed a row when the museum was accused of turning down an offer of her clothes. It later denied rejecting them. Its chairman, Nicholas Coleridge, insisted there was “no letter, no meeting, no judgment … no overture of any kind”.The dust on that row has long settled and the Thatcher handbag will be a star of a show exploring what the V\u0026ampA calls “the ultimate accessory”.The show’s curator, Lucia Savi, said the exhibition would offer “an understanding and insight into the function, status, design and making of bags across the world and throughout history”.Different visitors will be excited by different stories.Some will enjoy seeing a second world war gas mask bag, which belonged to Queen Mary.Others will thrill at seeing the purple Fendi Baguette bag worn by Sarah Jessica Parker’s Carrie Bradshaw character in Sex and the City, a bag memorably taken from her at gunpoint: “Give me your bag,” says the robber. “It’s a Baguette,” she corrects him, mournfully.In total, more than 300 objects will go on display, varying in size from tiny finger purses to large travel trunks.Celebrity endorsement will be explored with a Louis Vuitton bag, designed by Marc Jacobs and made from gold reflective vinyl popularised by Hilton and Kardashian during the “it bag” craze of the early 2000s.• Bags: Inside Out runs at the V\u0026ampA from 25 April 2020 to 31 January 2021"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b7331bf6d0d40efc11101a168263838d331db16/288_154_1299_780/master/1299.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0aaa63968a90bab53245f92e5cc1354c","title":"invasion planet earth review sci fi film drama","story":"A suburban London psychiatrist and his patients are kidnapped by aliens in this delightfully clunky, on-a-budget adventureThis UK-produced apocalyptic science-fiction yarn looks as if it was made with just enough budget to cover a couple of lights, petrol, the delightfully clunky visual effects – the digital equivalent of sticky-back plastic and pipe cleaners – and a few sandwiches for the cast and crew. But props are due to writer-director Simon Cox, the several dozen producers credited and cast and crew who sunk time, money and effort to make something so ludicrously ambitious with such meagre means, even if the end result is markedly uneven.The main protagonist is Tom Dunn (Simon Haycock), a psychiatrist living in the London suburbs with his school-teacher wife Mandy (Lucy Drive), who has just discovered she’s pregnant. This is bittersweet news for the couple who are still grieving the death a few years earlier of their small daughter, but both are trying to be hopeful and positive. That’s going to be needed because it looks as if the world is on the brink of war and aliens have invaded. The extraterrestrials kidnap Tom and a handful of his most eccentric patients, setting on them off on bizarre adventures seemingly engineered to make them confront their deepest fears and traumas.It’s not entirely clear if these head games from another planet have good or ill intentions, but one thing is clear: they must have been watching a lot of vintage sci-fi, especially the Terminator and Matrix franchises, judging by their taste in spaceship interior design. The performances, apart from those of the lead actors, are often painfully stiff, but presumably the cast had to do a lot of reacting to tennis balls on sticks in green-screen studios.

They put shop-bought ones completely in the shadeWhen people claim they don’t like mince pies, I feel compelled to assure them it’s just the commercial version they object to – if they tried homemade ones, with their crumbly, buttery pastry and fruit-packed filling, they’d agree I was right.

The whisky can be replaced by fruit juice or tea, though it won’t keep as well if you go down the booze-free route.You can make the mincemeat well in advance, so long as you sterilise the jars properly (if you’re using it immediately, skip this step). Either wash the jars and lids in hot, soapy water, or run them through a hot dishwasher cycle, then dry them in a low oven (about 120C (100C fan)250Fgas ¼) for 20 minutes, until dry, and fill them straight from the oven.Roughly chop any of the fruit that needs it into raisin-sized pieces. Lightly toast the nuts, if using, in a dry pan until fragrant, then roughly chop them, too. Put both into a large bowl with the ginger, sugar, spice, whisky (brandy, golden or dark rum, amaretto or sloe gin will also work), zest, grated apple and suet, or grate in the butter, if using.Add a little more spice, if you think it needs it, or indeed booze. If you haven’t used the ginger, add a dash more booze, to make up for the loss of the syrup. Decant into the sterilised jars if you’re not planning on using the filling immediately.Sift the flour into a bowl with a good pinch of fine salt. If you’d prefer to keep it nut-free, swap the ground almonds for the same amount of extra flour. Grate in the cold butter, then rub this into the flour with your fingertips until the mixture looks like damp sand.Stir in the ground almonds (or extra flour) and sugar. Whisk the egg yolks with the orange blossom water, if using, and a tablespoon and a half of ice-cold water (two, if you’re not using the orange blossom water) – add just enough to bring the mix together into a firm, but not wet dough. Shape into a ball by hand, wrap well, and chill for half an hour.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)390Fgas 5. Grease two tartlet tins of whatever size you prefer with butter, and roll out half the pastry on a lightly floured surface until about 3mm thick. Cut out bases a little larger than the tin holes and use to line them, then fill each about three-quarters full with the mincemeat.Roll out the other half of the pastry and cut out into rounds the same size as the tin holes. Alternatively, cut out stars or hearts, or top the pies with nuts (whole pecans and flaked almonds are nice) or even marzipan shapes, if you prefer less pastry-heavy pies.If using a pastry top, dampen the edge of the lids with a little water or milk, and press down lightly on the pies to seal. Brush the tops with milk or beaten egg, and prick with a fork.

She has spoken out against racism, sexism and homophobia. She was also the first white professional athlete to kneel for the US national anthem, joining Colin Kaepernick’s protest against racial and social injustice in the United States.After Napoli’s Kalidou Koulibaly suffered racist abuse during a game against Internazionale last season, Ronaldo posted a message on Instagram saying “No to racism and any offense \u0026amp discrimination”, while Ibrahimovic, whose father is Muslim, has said he has been a victim of Islamaphobia. Messi is notoriously reluctant to say anything to the media beyond events on the field.None of the three can be compared to Rapinoe in terms of activism.

Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!In 1937, the world’s first-ever live football match was transmitted by the BBC’s Television Service. Arsenal – then the best team in the land (kids, ask granny) – faced Arsenal Reserves in a training match at Highbury, the only ground the Beeb could reach from their Alexandra Palace studio with their big roll of cable. Eighty-two years on, Amazon joined the fray, and history soon repeated itself. On Tuesday night – using exactly the same vintage BBC equipment, if the way The Fiver’s picture regularly slipped in and out of focus was any guide – the newest broadcaster on the scene also premiered with a dull training run-out. Manchester City’s gentle trot around Turf Moor made for viewing nearly as captivating as the eight hours of All or Nothing. Thanks, Jeff Bezos! More, please!And indeed there will be more. Much more. Wednesday’s line-up on Amazon includes the Merseyside derby, Frank Lampard’s Chelsea’s Frank Lampard versus Plain Old John Terry, another tense relegation six-pointer at St Mary’s, and a festive panto from Manchester in which Humility Man™, the boy who never grew up, returns to Neverland. It’s a schedule sure to go down in broadcasting lore, alongside those legendary Christmas Days when BBC1 aired The Generation Game, Mike Yarwood and Morecambe and Wise, the must-see-TV nights on NBC when Friends was followed by Seinfeld and ER, and of course Television Service’s memorable triple whammy of 3.40pm Football at the Arsenal, 3.55pm Cartoon, 4pm Closedown. Thanks again, Jeff!The biggest match in the listings is ostensibly the one at Anfield, where league leaders Liverpool defend their long unbeaten run against Everton. But anyone who remembers Wayne Clarke and what he did in 1988 – another question for granny, perhaps – already knows how that one is likely to end. It’s just going to happen, isn’t it. So perhaps the more intriguing programme is the panto. Manchester United are currently enduring their worst start to a league season in 31 years, so the last person anyone at Old Trafford wants to see is … look out, Ole! He’s behind you! Yes, it promises to be a proper night of entertainment, and it’s all live on Amazon. Thanks in advance for all the fun, Jeff, and especially for the chance to cough up an extra eight quid for some stuff we already had. Thanks!Join Simon Burnton from 7.30pm GMT for hot Premier League clockwatch action, while Scott Murray will be on hand for Liverpool 1-2 Everton at 8.15pm.“I feel absolutely honoured to be getting abuse from Man City fans … it’s made me emosh!

This season that meant that Chelsea, who reached last season’s Champions League semi-final before losing 3-2 to the eventual winners Lyon over two legs, missed out after they finished third in the WSL behind Arsenal and Manchester City.For the 2021-22 season, each of the top six nations – calculated according to Uefa’s coefficients – will receive a third team, and TV rights and sponsorship from the group stage onwards will be marketed centrally, rather than just the final. Countries ranked seventh to 16th will have two entrants.Managers have been calling for a revamp. Last month Chelsea’s Emma Hayes said of a third spot for England: “That needs to happen. The same for Germany, though, and probably France.”Arsenal’s Joe Montemurro said in September that a group stage was a logical step. “It’s only fair to the clubs that do invest in women’s football that they should be given the opportunity to be in the Champions League from a revenue perspective. And once you get a say a third team from, say, England, making the the Champions League group stages there’s a revenue coming back. That’s more money coming into the game.”Uefa’s president, Aleksander Ceferin, said: “By guaranteeing teams more matches against their elite rivals, we believe that the group structure will raise the quality of the women’s game even more.”Qualification for the group stage will come through two rounds. Round one will see teams play a series of mini-tournaments, with semi-finals, a third-place match and a final.

You can read about VSCO girls (beachy and eco-conscious and inconspicuously rich) and e-girls (emo types who are very online) in publications such as the New York Times and the Columbia Journalism Review.Yet the holy trinity of Gen Z teen girl taxonomy would not be complete without the soft girl, the internet’s new favorite girl-next-door.(The “softboi” also exists – he’s an emotionally exploitative lothario described here).“I feel like the soft-girl aesthetic is really popping off if you look in the right places,” says Jamie, a 14-year-old West Virginian and creator of Reddit’s rsoftgirl, over Messenger. “On TikTok, I see a lot of videos radiating soft-girl energy.”That means, she says, “hair clips, soft colors, mom jeans, glossy lips and overall just a dreamy vibe”. You will find the soft girl online, pigtailed, clad in pastels, perhaps with a spray of faux freckles – or little clouds, or hearts – painted across her blush-pinkened cheeks and highlighted nose.She may wear toned-down versions of this look to school and in daily life, but its fully realized, campy extreme can only be found when she broadcasts on social media, usually from her bedroom.The soft look isn’t new – teens have pursued cuteness forever, and the underpinnings of soft-girl style have long incubated on Instagram, and on Tumblr, where glittery girlishness has been associated with a controversial fourth-wave “Tumblr feminist” effort to satirize gender expectations by amplifying feminine stereotypes.Several of the genre’s components also have roots in anime fan culture for instance, peppering one’s textual speech with the manga-derived emoticon “uwu”, (pronounced “ou-wu,” like babytalk) meant to resemble a smiling face with closed eyes, and used to indicate the speaker either is being cute themselves or is responding to something cute (similar to “aww”).Although glitter, pastel hair and “uwu” have been around for a while, it’s only in the last year these components have truly coalesced into the latter-day manic pixie dream girl, catching sufficient fire to garner an official “soft szn” (spring), “get-the-look” shopping guides, and rap shout-outs.For the latter, listen to SoundCloud rapper Haroinfather’s TikTok-famous track Tunnel of Love, an ode to soft girls featuring the verse “You so fucking cute  When I see you I uwu” (in case you were wondering, yes, his use of “uwu” as a verb is novel).All together, the vision of femininity soft girls evoke can be seen as dispiritingly retrograde – a kittenish broadcast of reductive tropes from a generation older feminists probably hoped would grow up more enlightened. Don’t these girls have anything better to do than spend their time and money trying to look harmless on the internet?The impulse to dismiss the soft girl as silly may overlook the deeply felt vulnerability of girlhood, and the desire to reckon with it on one’s own terms. In 2015, the author Lucy Ellman described teenage girls as living “in terror of the society in which they find themselves … their main aim is to reach adulthood without being raped, shot, manhandled, or murdered.” It’s a dark statement, but not an inaccurate one. Teen girls are often discredited and exploited for being pretty and eager to please others, characteristics dominant culture pressures them to have. Girls are disproportionately penalized by school attire policies, body-shamed, and blamed for “inviting” sexual harassment, which most begin experiencing at about 14.According to Simon May, professor of philosophy at King’s College London and author of 2019’s The Power of Cute, there is more going on with soft girls than just blush and Bambi eyes. Cuteness, he says, especially when it’s over the top, “steps outside the power paradigm”.“To me, these girls are ironizing the whole question of power. Do they have it, don’t they have it, what is it to have it, and does it matter?” he says.So, is the soft girl aesthetic a sarcastic send-up of power dynamics? Is it a kind of sublimation of teen girl frustration at society’s hypocrisy towards them? Could it be a self-soothing attempt to cultivate tenderness in a frightening world?It may be a all these things and more. Irony, as May points out, is clearly a factor of the soft-girl look. The popular 2019 #softgirlchallenge, in which teens edited their videos so they appeared to spontaneously transform from grungy e-girl to glimmering soft girl particularly conveys how lightly Gen Z wears its group affiliations. These subcultures exist simultaneously as personas, styles, statements and jokes.Once, high-schoolers may have rigidly aligned with their in-groups, committing to being a punk or a hippie, a theatre kid or a cheerleader today, the performative medium of TikTok encourages mutability – you can play with being an e-girl or a soft girl or any other archetype you please.As for Jamie, she says she likes the soft-girl look because it’s fun to express herself through softness. “Embracing cuteness, getting into cute things, it really boosted my happiness and made me more comfortable with my life,” she says. She thinks she’ll stick with the soft-girl aesthetic for a while due to its “positive energy”, but she may change it up one day.Why? Because, she says, “that’s what you do when you’re finding yourself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/552c7661376bea707f2a72eb558564f7b5eb0fcd/0_109_3963_2378/master/3963.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e31206e216af00b6d45d05d79b6caa3e","title":"m and g suspends property portfolio fund retail downturn brexit","story":"M\u0026ampG Property Portfolio bans withdrawals after investors demand their money backOne of the UK’s biggest property funds, which owns shopping centres across the country, has alarmed investors by banning withdrawals and blaming both Brexit and the retail downturn for its problems.The £2.5bn M\u0026ampG Property Portfolio was suspended after “unusually high and sustained outflows” – demand from investors for their money back – prompted by “Brexit-related political uncertainty and ongoing structural shifts in the UK retail sector”.M\u0026ampG admitted it had been unable to sell commercial property fast enough to fund the rush for the door by investors, leaving it with no choice but to prevent further withdrawals.The fund’s biggest holdings include shopping centres such as Fremlin Walk in Maidstone, Kent, where House of Fraser is one of the biggest tenants.M\u0026ampG said the suspension would give it time to raise cash to repay investors. While the fund is suspended, M\u0026ampG will cut the fees it charges to manage the fund. M\u0026ampG did not give a timeline for when the fund would be reopened, saying it was monitoring the situation daily.The financial adviser Chase de Vere told investors not to panic, but added: “M\u0026ampG has struggled with this due to number of investors cashing out and a relatively high exposure to retail properties, which are proving difficult to sell.The suspension of the M\u0026ampG fund is the latest setback for the investment industry after the closure of the Woodford funds, and will increase calls for stiffer regulation of funds in illiquid securities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/128be2724a0b9d236c71ae7d1c15754a47eb49da/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a24b3ad3d85656dad46c86a58b9debb","title":"50 best albums of 2019","story":"Our pick of the year’s finest albums sways to lovestruck hip-hop-soul, confrontational pop, heartwarming indie and badass country.

Its impact on the music industry has been less conspicuous than the gaudy discounts toted by mainstream retailers, but no less significant. Founded in 2008, Record Store Day (RSD) proper takes place every April in 2010, its American organisers introduced RSD Black Friday, intended as a celebration of independent shops and special-edition records as the antithesis to the corporate frenzy. “Cheapness is not a main goal,” they explain. “Celebrating art is.”Their choice of words is telling. RSD Black Friday has also made it to the UK in recent years: at my local record shop last week, people queued for the 8am opening to snag the nearly 100 special releases. Early sellouts included a 12-inch picture disc of Jimi Hendrix’s Merry Christmas and Happy New Year (£28). A 12-inch of Lizzo’s Coconut Oil was pressed on coconut-coloured vinyl with a coconut-scented insert (£25). If you missed those, you could grab Lou Reed’s 2003 album, The Raven, for £50.RSD and the fetishisation of vinyl has grown in inverse proportion to any pleasure I used to feel as a longtime record buyer. I started as a teenager in the early 2000s and now own a couple of thousand LPs. I’m no longer overwhelmed by choice and excitement when I walk into a shop, just dismayed and despondent about how much everything costs and how silly some of it is. I feel priced out, excluded from a group that I presumed would count me as a member for life.It’s not just exasperated shoppers like me who are noticing this. Recently, the American record label Numero Group tweeted: “Real talk: Records are too expensive. $30 represses from your favourite major label now dominate the bins.” They launched a counteroffensive, slashing LP prices to $15, double LPs to $22 and CDs to $10. “We try to treat records as a format to distribute music, not as merch,” label co-founder Rob Sevier tells me.For me, records have always been synonymous with sacrifice. As a student, buying albums might mean skimping on the food shop or putting off that final-warning bill for another week. The trade-off felt worth it as I regarded my growing collection with pride, something that I had worked hard to build. But the trade-off between sacrifice and reward has soured. I went to buy the recent Inoyama Land reissue but was met with a £42 price tag. I scanned the racks for something else, searching through countless £25 new releases while spotting reissues that I bought six years ago, for £15, that have now been reissued again at £35. I didn’t have any more luck in the secondhand section, rarely finding anything below £20. It’s felt like this for a while.I used to love trawling charity shops for bargains, but online marketplace Discogs has given shops a resource to increase prices. While nobody can begrudge charities for getting wise to a trend and changing prices accordingly, the thrill of finding gold there is long gone. The relatively recent days of skipping past hundreds of copies of Paul Young’s No Parlez to unearth £2 copies of Talking Heads albums have been replaced by £15 stickers slapped on tatty copies of bog standard stuff such as Bob Dylan’s Greatest Hits Vol 2.So why have records become more expensive? Phil Leigh of online retailer Norman Records blames RSD. “It’s been hugely popular and is largely based around reissues, legacy acts and collectibles. The major labels have realised they can expand on that and make quite a bit of money from it – so they have.”What constitutes an easy cash-in for majors doesn’t trickle down to small indies. Michael Kasparis of Glaswegian label Night School recently tweeted: “If I had the guts I’d stop doing stupid limited editions with signed tat or hardcover books or candy coloured splatter vinyl because I find the whole thing based on novelty and totally toxic when it comes to sustainability in this fucked industry. But I don’t.”They’re a necessary evil, he tells me. “I’ll often put a record out that’s just 500 copies on black vinyl,” he says. “And I guarantee you, if I did it as 500 clear vinyl it’d sell way quicker. It doesn’t make sense. I think RSD and producing manufactured rarities has developed this mentality in record buyers that was kind of already there but it’s turbo-charged now.”Leigh says that some distributors price new box sets so high that it’s often cheaper for Norman Records to acquire them from Amazon, in which case they simply won’t stock them. He confirms Kasparis’s accounts of consumers becoming averse to standard issue records. “We could sell 100 copies of a coloured vinyl and not sell a single black one,” says Leigh. “It’s the same record and the black one probably sounds better. It’s just weird.”The culture of collecting rare records is nothing new. But deliberately forcing rarity and collectible status on new music, on a widespread scale and at increased prices, has seen average buyers herded into that collector mentality. For some, buying records is longer about owning the same piece of music as everyone else but owning a version of it that few others have. It reflects a change in contemporary relationships to owning music, says Sevier. “Owning a limited or special edition is doubling down on the closeness you feel to an album or artist. You can’t display your streaming history like a trophy.”Kasparis welcomes counter-initiatives such as Dinked, a run of exclusive editions only available at independent outfits, although they also contribute to the pricing problem. “Combating Amazon by having indie store-only releases has been great,” says Leigh. “Otherwise, I’m not sure indie stores would exist any more. Even if you disapprove of where things are going, you still want those shops to stay open.”This year, vinyl sales in the UK are predicted to hit 4.5m – up from 4m in 2018 and outselling CDs for the first time in more than 30 years. Is the industry’s embrace of novelty simply a case of supply and demand? Or the peak of a classic boom and bust cycle? “I’ve always had a gut feeling that during the vinyl revival, labels are going to end up killing it by pricing everything too high,” says Leigh. “They could end up shooting themselves in the foot. If they want vinyl to become mainstream then it needs to be cheaper.”Still, he admits that there’s a diehard group of consumers who will continue to support this state of affairs. “It’ll never go away because there’s always a market for it – it’s been so over-fetishised that it’s part of the culture now. That’s why the majors have adopted some of these silly pricing policies.”For labels, a consumer is a consumer. But for every new buyer willing to spend £45 on a new record, I’d wager that someone like me is lost. Rummaging and revelation have been replaced by expense and exclusion. I’ll doubtless continue to buy some records but it’s becoming a world to which I no longer feel attached.The 15 David Bowie records I own, picked up from various charity shops, cost me a grand total of about £20. The last 7-inch I bought – one song – was £10 plus postage. Scanning new vinyl releases for this Friday, I see three different versions of the same live album by Idles at £30 a pop. Of course, you can buy the collector’s bundle and get all three for just £85. I’m starting to think: what’s the point?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47d48e0b64eeafe6596209fc42cf49584efda607/0_35_4077_2446/master/4077.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aee7a633ace6a0f9f634a78edd51b37d","title":"bame support for jeremy corbyn much higher than overall electorate","story":"Labour is leading Conservatives by 25 points among such voters, Opinium poll showsBlack and ethnic minority voters are backing Jeremy Corbyn in far higher numbers than the overall electorate as the two main political parties vie for their votes in crucial swing seats.The figures have been disclosed as the two main parties make a concerted push to win over the BAME vote with specifically tailored policies. They appear to reinforce the belief that second- and third-generation BAME immigrants, alarmed by the Windrush scandal and allegations of Islamophobia within the Conservatives, still distrust the party.Despite the latest data, the Conservatives believe they are gaining support in areas with large Hindu, Sikh and African communities, with promises of business-friendly policies and an easing of post-Brexit immigration restrictions on Commonwealth countries.It came as the campaign group Operation Black Vote (OBV) said the BAME vote could dictate the outcome in 100 key marginals including Labour-held Kensington, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Richmond Park, Southampton Itchen, Peterborough and Portsmouth South.Lord Woolley, the founder of OBV, said that during this election, the BAME vote will be more crucial than ever. “There have never been so many marginal seats, and there have never been so many where the BAME vote is important,” he said.“The implications for people of colour are writ large in this election. The Brexit narrative says ‘we are a white, Christian nation and we are going to assert that’. Think about it and you begin to realise how important those votes will be.”Opinium surveyed BAME voters nationwide between 5 and 14 November and discovered differing approval ratings from those in the electorate at large.Corbyn last week launched the party’s first race and faith manifesto in an effort to woo BAME voters. Policies included a new public body to oversee the legacy of colonialism, a race equality unit at the Treasury, a pledge to introduce more black teachers and reduced charges for Home Office documents and tests.The policy announcement was overshadowed by the chief rabbi’s criticisms of Labour’s leadership for failing to tackle prejudice against another minority, the UK’s Jewish community. Labour is facing a formal antisemitism inquiry by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and pollsters believe the party could pay an electoral price for the allegations which have dogged it for three and a half years.The Conservatives have included policies in their manifesto that they believe will appeal to minority ethnic voters. They include pledges to invest £90m into the Youth Futures Foundation to improve employment outcomes for young people, mainly in urban areas.There is also a pledge to support for a memorial recognising the contribution of the Windrush generation after the scandal that dogged the party in 2017.Senior Tories, including the home secretary, Priti Patel, and the chancellor, Sajid Javid, have attempted to exploit resentment among BAME residents over the apparent ease with which “white Europeans” could bring over spouses compared with BAME people from African, Asian and Caribbean countries.Others say that the apparent wooing of BAME people may well take a back seat towards the end of the campaign. The Conservatives have acknowledged they must win leave seats in the north and the Midlands, which have large white working-class communities.Sunder Katwala, the director of the British Future thinktank, said the BAME vote gets more important at every election because the population is becoming increasingly erse.But he expects the campaign to increasingly focus upon the needs of predominantly white communities whose votes are required for a working Commons majority. “Leave voting towns are, in the main, a little older and whiter. We can expect that the battlegrounds will be slightly less erse seats,” he said.“When the Tories have won, they have concentrated on less erse areas and they can do that again. But in the long term, their strategy will have to change to find a way of winning over a more erse and fractured BAME community,” he said.There has been a recognisable change in the way BAME communities vote, Katwala said. First-generation immigrants could not bring themselves to vote for the Conservatives because of the party’s past pandering to racist attitudes exemplified by Enoch Powell’s speeches and Norman Tebbit’s “cricket test”.“Ask younger BAME people, they do not know who Enoch Powell is. His resonance is of less importance and other mainstream issues such as health, education and the economy are of more importance,” he said.Politicians will continue to ingratiate themselves with ethnically erse communities during election campaigns, Katwala said, but can no longer rely upon a bloc vote to turn out.“It is fine if politicians go to gurdwaras and mosques as they always do for photo opportunities but they must drop the idea that ethnic minority voters turn up to those places to be told how to vote any more than a white British voter turns up to a C of E chapel to hear how they should vote,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd23b346e83cfb448c15dd1fb97ac19ad66b9f0c/0_74_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0624b3b6c916cb866451e8873652c5bf","title":"jeremy corbyn pressed on his wildest moment itv interview","story":"Labour leader asked about his ‘most reckless’ romantic acts and if he watches Queen’s speechIt was the Labour leader’s Theresa May moment – and it was about as risqué as his former rival’s memory of running through a field of wheat.Two years after May was asked by ITV’s Julie Etchingham to share the naughtiest thing she had ever done, the broadcaster urged Jeremy Corbyn to reveal “the most romantic … wild and reckless” moment of his life – and eventually drew the answer that he had enjoyed some “wonderful holidays” with his wife, Laura Álvarez.Etchingham’s question on his romantic traits also drew an awkward response. “Wow. That’s a hard one. Nobody ever thinks of me as romantic,” he said when the question was first put to him.The presenter asked again: “What is the most romantic sort of wild and reckless thing you’ve ever done?” to which Corbyn said: “You can’t ask that question on television!”Etchingham pressed Corbyn, reminding him of the infamous occasion on which she asked Theresa May the naughtiest thing she ever did during the 2017 election, prompting the Labour leader to finally say: “When you’re with somebody, you have a great time together, and we’ve had some wonderful holidays together, and we enjoy that.”May’s response to Etchingham’s question about her naughtiest moment drew widespread derision and imitation in memes. “I have to confess, when me and my friend, sort of, used to run through the fields of wheat – the farmers weren’t too pleased about that,” the former prime minister admitted.In ITV’s The Leader Interviews: Jeremy Corbyn – Tonight, which airs at 7.30pm on Thursday, the Labour leader also spoke about his role as his household’s “head of composting”.While Corbyn admitted he wasn’t very good at housework, he said: “I am good at putting the garbage out, I am good at putting the recycling out … I’m also the head manager of the whole composting arrangements.”Corbyn said he would give up Chequers if he was elected as prime minister. In September, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said he would let a homeless family move into No 11 Downing Street.Corbyn was also asked if he would apologise to those who had suffered as a result of his party’s delays in dealing with allegations of antisemitism. “Antisemitism is a vile evil in our society. I am not a racist, in any form. I’ve spent my life opposing racism. And I think the treatment of Jewish people that suffer from antisemitism is appalling. And where there’s been delays, by my party, in instituting a process, of course I apologise to those that suffered as a result of it,” he said. His apology echoed a similar response in an interview on This Morning on Tuesday.The Labour leader was also asked whether he watched the Queen’s speech on Christmas Day. When Etchingham asked if he sat down with his family to watch the speech, Corbyn said: “It’s on in the morning, usually we have it on … some of the time.”After Etchingham pointed out that it was actually broadcast in the afternoon and accused the Labour leader of not watching it, he said: “There is lots … Lots to do … I enjoy the presence of my family and friends around Christmas. Obviously, like everybody else does. And I also visit the homeless shelter, either on Christmas Day or the day before, to talk to, and listen to people’s lives, about how they could be made better with a government that cared for them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cd40813bed02a67170a1134f55d94ff3e54c11b/0_35_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1768ceebdd5537861b605606f576054","title":"labour politics reforms include ban on mps holding second jobs","story":"Proposals would also end donations from tax evaders and change lobbying rulesMPs would be banned from holding second jobs under reforms of the rules governing political donations and lobbying that have been proposed by the Labour party.Political donations from convicted tax evaders would be banned, while ministers would be prevented from becoming lobbyists for five years after they leave office under the proposals.Legislation for the reforms would be enacted immediately upon entering office so as to prevent undue interference in a second referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union, the party said.In a statement Jon Trickett, shadow minister for the cabinet office said: “Under the Tories, politics and government is in serious danger of becoming a playground for the rich and powerful, with decisions often made behind closed doors in the interests of a small few, at the expense of the many.“This is very worrying for our democracy. The rules that are supposed to prevent this are completely ineffective. The time for their replacement is long overdue.” The Conservative party was approached for comment.Labour has also proposed abolishing the Lobbying Act, criticised as a “gagging law” by some for restricting charities from campaigning on policy issues in the run-up to elections, while exempting swathes of the public relations industry from registration.The party instead proposes expanding the rules to require the registration of in-house lobbyists who work full-time for a particular organisation, in addition to the specialist lobbying firms.

Here is her diaryMy first session comes at a busy time of the year as staff gear up for Christmas. Each person who comes through the door is offered a hot drink and some toast while they tell volunteers their reasons for being there. A teacher has turned up to ask for a package for a young boy’s family. He arrived at school three days in a row without having had breakfast. When she called the child’s parents, she says his mother broke down in tears saying, “I can’t afford to feed my children.” A woman comes in and says she has recently been moved on to universal credit. She received her last payment from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in mid-November and has been told not to expect anything else until 12 January. She doesn’t know how she will get through the festive period.The closer we get to Christmas, the busier it gets. The food bank is only open on a Wednesday morning and at least 10 volunteers turn up every week to help the three part-time staff. During one session a small boy of about five approaches me and asks quietly if there is any turkey so that he can have a Christmas dinner. Amid all the desperation, there are moments of light. The food bank will be closed from Christmas Eve until the new year but on one of the last days of opening , a man and his son turn up with bags full of food and toiletries. Their family decided to donate to the food bank rather than buying presents for each other. Most donations come from iniduals so there are times when supplies run low, especially of particular items such astoilet rolls, nappies and longlife milk.Number of parcels issued: 190Staff thought that things would quieten down after Christmas but the impact of universal credit is starting to be felt and it has become normal for a long queue of people to be waiting outside before the doors open at 10am. In just one morning I speak to four people who have been movedfrom employment support allowance to universal credit. They’ve all been forced to rely on food handouts during the wait for their first payment. One woman says that she needs to attend a hospital appointment but can’t afford the bus fare so will not be going. A man in insecure work has rent arrears that he previously paid £5 a week towards clearing. After being moved to universal credit, he now has to pay £127 a month. He has a serious lung condition and high blood pressure but says he regularly goes without gas and electricity for much of the month. “I top it up once, then when it runs out I just sit in my coat.”Number of parcels issued: 171A woman and her four-year-old child arrive at the Emmanuel church, where the food bank is held. They arrived the day before and were given a hot meal at the community cafe that is run from the same building and told to return for an emergency food package. After a run of bad luck, they have ended up sleeping in a car. She says it was so cold one night that there was ice on the inside of the window when they woke up. Volunteers signpost them to various support services and tell them to keep returning until the situation is resolved. People have started to hear about universal credit advance payments but many are too scared to take one. There is a lot of confusion over how much needs to be paid back and when.Number of parcels issued: 174 Things continue to be busy. Volunteers say that last year it was normal to see around 20 people each week, now sometimes more than 40 parcels are handed out during a single session. A man has travelled six miles by bike. He’ll have to make the same journey back with six heavy bags full of tins, jars and other food. He doesn’t complain, he says he is just grateful for the help.A pregnant woman has been forced to use the food bank for the first time after being moved on to universal credit. She says she “hasn’t done much eating lately” and has been in hospital with malnutrition following a stomach bug. Her rent is high and there is a list of problems with her home that she is trying to get sorted. She is worried about her children and the new baby and says that feeding them comes before feeding herself.Another family made their universal credit claim on 14 February and have been told they will not get the first payment until the beginning of April.Number of parcels issued: 177 Many of the people who use the food bank are middle-aged or younger, but one day three pensioners come in during a single session. One of them, a 69-year-old man, is almost in tears as he says he is using his life savings to pay his rent because of a housing benefit mistake. Despite being of pension age he still works but has recently lost his job and this is the first time he’s used a food bank. As we talk, I can hear his voice breaking. He apologises and quickly leaves with his bags.A man comes in almost completely doubled over and walking with a stick. Despite a string of health conditions, he has been told he is fit for work. He has to get two buses home and staff are concerned about how he will manage with all his bags of food. He’s helped down to the bus stop but from there he is alone. The volunteers work incredibly hard. It can be both physically and emotionally tiring. When they are not moving heavy boxes and bags, they are listening to people in crisis. It’s clear that for some people having somebody to talk to is almost as important as the food they are collecting.Number of parcels issued: 173A woman who works 30 hours a week was moved on to universal credit from tax credits in March. She still hasn’t had her first payment but has received an advance. She decided to use this to cover some of her rent because she was under pressure from her landlord – now there is nothing left. She’s come to the food bank with her manager from work because she needs some support.She says she’s never been in such a bad position, even when she was unemployed. “The bills are adding up and I’ve been charged by the bank for unpaid direct debits. I broke down yesterday because I’m just so embarrassed by it all.” Number of parcels issued: 170 A young mother comes in who waited the standard five weeks for her first universal credit payment but, when she received it, it was £120 less than she’d been told. She’s been without electricity for a week and is having to walk to a friend’s house to do her cooking every day.So many people here have spent years living on the edge of poverty, just managing to survive. Often it’s only a minor change to their circumstances that pushes them over the edge. They then face a huge battle to get back to where they were before.Number of parcels issued: 118Many of the parents are starting to worry about the summer holidays. Before they even think about the cost of entertaining their children for six long weeks, there is the matter of feeding them. Most rely on free school lunches for the one hot meal their children will receive each day.The woman who came in earlier in the year because she was sleeping in a car with her daughter is now working part time and renting a small house. She has just received her first universal credit payment and used some of it to buy a trolley-load of donations for the food bank.Number of parcels issued: 184It’s the summer holidays and as well as helping out at the food bank, some staff are running local lunch clubs. They provide a meal for the whole family and lots of activities for the children. The groups are run separately from the food bank and because they do not open every day the families in urgent need still come here.Some people are worried about the cost of school uniforms and shoes, especially those who have children moving up to secondary school. One woman is upset because she’d managed to buy everything her daughter needed but her PE bag has just broken and she doesn’t have the money to replace it. After speaking to her, a volunteer quickly pops out and buys one to give to her.Number of parcels issued: 137There is nowhere near enough recognition for the amazing work the staff and volunteers of food banks do. I’ve been coming here for more than nine months now and I’ve seen the dedication and care that goes into offering the type of support the staff provide. They have stepped in where the state has failed. The number of people coming in has fluctuated over the last few months. Nobody can say for definite why – but it’s still not unusual for people to be queueing to get in. One morning I arrive half an hour before opening and there are already two women with small babies and another in a wheelchair waiting outside.Number of parcels issued: 140 A lot of people who come in have debt problems. One man, who was previously street homeless, is terrified about losing his home because of unpaid bills. He would usually be referred to the national debt charity, CAP, but food bank staff have been told they are not taking any new clients until February next year because they are so busy. A local debt service is also unable to take on anyone new at the moment. Another asks if they can call him later in the week to talk through his options but as he doesn’t have a phone that’s not possible. After a volunteer spends an hour calling around different places, a home visit is finally arranged for him.Being able to signpost people to other services is vital but in Northamptonshire, like other areas, many organisations are facing cuts to funding. To help meet the need, monthly advice clinics are held at the food bank by a community law group, the local Labour party candidate, Sally Keeble, and a mental health charity. There is always a queue of people waiting for their help.Number of parcels issued: 165 A recent Trussell Trust report  shows that two-thirds of people who have used a food bank have had problems with the benefit system in the last year. This comes as no surprise to people here. It’s been clear to me in the time that I have been coming that, alongside low pay, benefit issues are the leading cause for people needing food handouts.A woman with MS, osteoarthritis and mental health problems comes in happily waving a letter in her hand. She saw her money drop significantly when she was moved from disability living allowance to personal independence payments and waited more than 30 weeks for her appeal against this to be heard at a tribunal. During that time she has regularly received emergency food and sanitary products. She’s just found out that her case was successful and wants to show staff the decision from the court.A social worker comes in to collect a parcel for a man with mental health problems. She says that he hasn’t eaten properly for four days and has been scavenging through bins to feed himself.Number of parcels issued: 131Tesco has held a food bank collection in its local store. It’s a huge help at this time of year when supplies can run low but it also means a lot of extra work for the volunteers. They worked out a rota so that there were always representatives at the supermarket to thank people for their donations. Others helped to transport and sort through the boxes of goods received.Piles of advent calendars are ready to be handed out and boxes of mince pies and chocolates are stacked high. Staff and volunteers have collected small gifts to give out and people can help themselves to wrapping paper, sellotape and cards.The general election is just over a week away and despite Labour’s pledges to tackle food poverty there has been very little national debate on the issue. Northampton is not a particularly deprived town yet almost 14,000 children are living in poverty here. There was much talk after the EU referendum about the people “left behind” but the people I’ve met at the food bank over the last year haven’t simply been left behind, they’ve been abandoned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e506fa0f94f1d6edacc9640b9d30c4a531a6c524/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9de28ccb0d22561d05d7f3fedeaa895","title":"ethics walking cricket socrates nietzsche aristotle plato kant","story":"To walk or not to walk, that is the question. What would Aristotle, Plato and Kant have done had they felt a nick?By Anthony McGowan for The NightwatchmanIt has been a frustrating season. You’ve managed a scratchy 30, a couple of awkward teens and more ducks than a farmyard pond in a children’s picture book. Thoughts of retirement float into your mind, along with the existential terror of what might take the place of these long days on a green field under greying skies. Golf? God, no.Then, finally, it seems like you’re in. Blue sky, no swing, flat track, friendly bowlers. You’ve done the hard work, wafting and missing outside off, surviving the early run-out opportunity. You’re starting to think the new socks might be just the talisman you needed. You allow yourself the luxury of hope. Along comes an innocuous delivery down the leg side. You flick at it, hoping for a glanced boundary, expecting the airy miss.And then you feel it. A barely perceptible touch. Almost like the little electric tingle you get from a tooth that will soon need root canal work. The bowler begins to go up but has a change of heart. Was there really a noise? He decides to keep on the umpire’s side for now, saving one in the bank for the nip-backer that might just clip leg. Then he’ll give his lungs a workout. The young keeper was a little more convinced but stifled his shout when he saw the bowler’s lack of conviction. But the keeper is suspicious. He looks at you as if to say: “Did you? I think you might have…”What do you do? Had you stroked your way to a nice 60, you might well nod, stick your bat under your arm and walk off, garnering goodwill and praise from all. But it’s not been that kind of season. You keep your head down and you ponder. I’m not sure any other sport has anything quite like this. There are plenty of opportunities for cheating in other sports and you can choose to reject them. Nudging your ball so it lies a little easier in the rough. Feigning assassination in the 18-yard box to win a penalty, then adding a flamboyant roll and clutching the face for the bonus of a sending-off. Calling “out” when your opponent’s backhand hits the line.But walking is different. It isn’t cheating to stand your ground. There is nothing in the laws of cricket that says you can’t wait for the umpire to make a decision. But there are moral aspects to this case. The fact that the laws are silent on walking means it is – almost uniquely in sport – a purely moral issue. One for the philosophers, rather than the third umpire.Let us imagine that the batter has felt that sickening click. He wants to do the right thing and is in a meditative, philosophical frame of mind. So he quickly reviews the history of Western moral philosophy to find some guidance from the greatest minds to have pondered the question of right and wrong.Ethics really gets going with Socrates, who changed the central question of philosophy from “what kind of stuff is there?” to “how should I live?”. His method was simple. He would find a person who claimed to be an expert in some area of ethical concern – the nature of, say, courage or piety or justice – and he would show them that everything they knew was wrong. But Socrates never actually answers the question of how we should live. The dialogues always end in a vaguely unsatisfactory way – not so much a hard-fought draw as match abandoned due to fog.But a few linked ethical principles emerge. The first is that the pursuit of virtue is the only worthwhile goal in life. The second is that virtue is the only real good. Other things that may appear good – wealth, power, beauty – are illusory and will never bring happiness. Living a virtuous life is the only path to happiness. And the third is that every person does, in fact, want to be good. Only ignorance stands in our way.Would Socrates have walked? The manner of his death tells us much. When he was put on trial for denying the gods and corrupting the young, he was found guilty and condemned to death. Although his friends offered to spirit him away, Socrates argued that it was only right for him to obey the laws of his city. He calmly took the hemlock and shuffled off to the great pavilion in the sky. So we can be sure that he would never question the umpire’s decision.He would have walked. To do otherwise, to stay at the wicket to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of not being out, would be to betray his life’s work.Socrates never gave a full account of what virtue actually is. That was left to his pupil, Plato. For Plato the world we perceive around us is an insubstantial shadow realm, a pale reflection or copy of the “real” world. This real world is made up of “ideas” or “forms” that act as a kind of template for the stuff we find around us in our world. As well as the original forms of material things such as triangles and beds, more exalted concepts such as beauty, virtue and justice also live in the world of the forms.How do we know every vaguely triangular thing is a triangle, or that a blue object is really blue? It’s because, says Plato, we have the ideas of a perfect triangle and perfect blueness already in our minds, and we use this template to judge whether or not these shapes before us are blue triangles. The same applies to virtue. If we want to judge any act – for example, walking when we’ve nicked off – we simply compare it to the idea of virtue in our minds. The ideas of triangle and blue are already in our mind because, argues Plato, before we were born our soul lived in that world of the perfect forms and has a vague memory of what it knew there.This last part is clearly nuts, but many philosophers still say ideas or forms do exist separately from their material embodiments, and that goodness or virtue must be one of these entities, and any act of virtue is such because it in some way copies or partakes in that form. Does this help us to decide whether or not to trudge back to the pavilion? The problem is that we still don’t know what this vague cloud of goodness is and how precisely it applies to our current dilemma.In his most famous dialogue, The Republic, Plato argues that injustice comes when the separate sections of the soul or the state get ideas above their station – your opening bowler trying to convince the skipper that he’s actually a perfect fit for the No 4 berth. There are three parts to the state: the rulers, warriors and workers (or skipper, batters and bowlers). The subisions of the soul are: the rational part, which uses reason to guide our action the appetitive, which keeps us alive by driving us to eat and drink and the spirited, which gives us courage and urges us on towards honour and victory.But how does this theory of justice apply to our dilemma? It’s hard to know. And – cards on the table here – although Plato is perhaps the most revered of all philosophers, I think he’s wrong on almost every important issue. But in general terms he, like Socrates, believed we should follow the laws of our particular state – anything else leads to chaos. I think Plato would have walked. However, he was also opposed to most forms of entertainment. He would have banned poetry, plays and any kind of music other than military marches, so he would probably have done away with cricket altogether. Wanker.The word “cynic” – which derives from the Greek term for “dog-like” – has come to mean someone who “disbelieves in the sincerity or goodness of human motives and actions, and is wont to express this by sneers and sarcasms.” It’s not an attractive picture: the thin-lipped misanthrope, mocking good intentions, forever pulling away the mask of virtue to reveal the hypocrite behind. Perhaps you’ve played with a Cynic, witnessed that sneer of cold contempt, the assumption of superiority, the presumption that all decency and honour are merely a sham.The Cynics lived simply, disdaining the trappings of wealth and worldly success, dressing in rags, sleeping rough, railing against the greed and materialism of the affluent. No convention was sacrosanct no moral or religious tradition left unmocked. They believed in doing openly those things most of us reserve for the privacy of the bedroom or bathroom. But Cynicism was, above all, a creed devoted to achieving a virtuous life and their critique was a necessary, if destructive, first step to enlightenment.What would the Cynics have said about walking? I’m afraid that they would have regarded the game itself as a ludicrous artifice. Diogenes (412-323 BC), the founder of the group, would have marched out to the wicket and defecated on the pitch, just short of a good length. No help there.These are one of the more misunderstood groups of Ancient philosophers. “Epicurean” has come to mean something similar to “hedonist” – someone who lives purely for pleasure. There’s something in that – the group’s leader, Epicurus (341-270 BC), did argue that the ultimate good is pleasure (as opposed to virtue, favoured by rival Platonists and Stoics).However, it wasn’t the crude pleasures of the flesh he had in mind, but instead calm contemplation and philosophical speculation. And his main concern wasn’t with actively finding physical delights but with eradicating things that cause us mental or physical pain. Retreat from the hurly burly, find a quiet garden to cultivate. Fend off hunger by all means, but live modestly and keep your desires in line with your ability to achieve them.Epicurus would have been most concerned about the mental consequences of not walking – the guilt, the anxiety, the fear of a confrontation with that angry bowler after the game. He probably would have walked and advised you to do the same.There was one group of ancient philosophers who were straightforwardly hedonistic. The Cyrenaic school, founded by Aristippus (435–356 BC), believed that the one thing you could know for certain was whether you were enjoying pleasure or suffering pain. The only good or virtuous things are pleasant sensations. The only bad things are unpleasant sensations. The past is gone forever and the future is unknowable. So live for this moment, eat, drink, and be as merry as you can. Frequent the pub and the bawdy house.Aristippus and the Cyrenaics would say do not walk. Enjoy your time out there. Do anything you can to maximise the pleasure of batting. Lie, cheat, whatever you like. Because there is nothing else – no greater goods, no higher power.The Sceptics, a school that began with Pyrrho of Elis (360-270 BC), maintained that knowledge was impossible. Our senses are fallible and our intellect can lead us astray. For any issue, you can argue equally persuasively on both sides. Therefore the only rational option is to withhold your judgment. Decide nothing. Did you edge the ball? Impossible to say. To walk would mean that you knew that you touched it. You can’t know that, or anything else for that matter. So don’t walk.The Stoics believed that everything is determined by an all-knowing, all-powerful god-like entity. Nothing happens by chance and nothing can be changed by human will. We are like dogs tied to a cart rolling uncontrollably down a hill. A foolish dog will whine and pull and skid and writhe a clever dog will understand that the cart cannot be resisted and trot along beside it. Knowledge and wisdom can only help us understand the direction that fate is taking us and to conform our will to that outcome.The Stoic virtues – prudence, justice, fortitude and temperance – are designed to help us endure the suffering that is inevitable in life. But we should take comfort from the fact that the ultimate destination is a good one. These are immensely useful thoughts for cricketers. Our sporting lives are full of woe. Yet we must, somehow, endure.And walking? The Stoic’s belief that the universe is a well ordered place, guided in the right direction by a benign god, means they trust in fate. If the umpire hasn’t given it, that must be the right thing. To interfere would be like the dog resisting the pull of the cart. The Stoic does not walk.Aristotle (384-322 BC) argued that every virtue is at the midpoint between two extremes represented by vices. For example, the virtue of courage is at the midpoint between the vices of recklessness and cowardice. Think of the quaking batsman backing away to square leg as one extreme, and the fool who goes out without wearing a box as the other. Or take generosity, which is at the midpoint between meanness and showy prodigality. Picture the skulking miser who never gets his round in after the game, and the show-off who flashes his Amex card and buys drinks for the whole bar. And then the modest fellow who buys a modest round for his mates and, in the rare event of a fifty, gets his jug in uncomplainingly.Applied to walking, I’d suggest that the two extremes are the player who will stand his ground even when given out and the player who is fairly sure he has missed it but walks to be on the safe side. Aristotle would have walked only if he was pretty sure the umpire was about to give him anyway. Otherwise I think he’d stay.As evidence, we can look at what happened when he, like Socrates, was threatened with prosecution for impiety. Rather than stay and take his punishment, Aristotle lifted up his skirts and fled. He’s a runner, not a walker.We’re leaping forward a couple of thousand years to the 18th century and the greatest of all philosophers, Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). Kant strove to find a moral principle that any rational person would agree on. He hits on his “categorical imperative”, a rule that says: “Act always in such a way that your action could become a universal law.”The example he gives is breaking a contract. If you agree to a contract and then break it, the categorical imperative asks that you imagine a world where it was a law of nature that all contracts were broken. In that world, nobody would ever enter into a contract and the whole institution of contracts would collapse. Your goal – to benefit by breaking your contract – would end in failure.Or take lying. Lying is a useful strategy only in a world in which most people tell the truth. If everyone always lied, there would be no point in your lies. The categorical imperative says your actions must be checked against the following principle: what would happen if everyone did what you do? Even if lying were to bring some great benefit to lots of other people, you shouldn’t do it.At this point people always come up with a counter example that makes the categorical imperative sound absurd. And the example they give is nearly always the mad axe murderer who knocks on their door and asks for the whereabouts of their intended victim, your best friend. The categorical imperative informs us that we must never lie and yet who could in conscience reveal the hiding place?Rather beautifully, Kant anticipates this precise example and his answer helps to explain why he thought you cannot base a moral system on looking at the consequences of your actions. The trouble with consequences is that they are, by definition, in the future, and the future is unpredictable. You might lie to the axeman, telling him that your friend isn’t at home when you know he is. But, seeing the axeman at the door, the friend might already have slipped out the back. And now the axeman encounters him in the street.In Kant’s view you can never be held responsible for the consequences of telling the truth, though you are responsible for the bad consequences of a lie. And there’s always the option of simply refusing to answer the axeman’s question or slamming the door in his face and calling the police. Refusing to walk could be seen as a type of lying. And lying breaks categorical imperative, so you have to walk.But Kant gives another formulation to the categorical imperative: “Act always in such a way that you treat other people as an end in themselves, and not as a means to an end”. We should not view our fellow cricketers as the means to our own pleasure. They also have hopes, dreams and fears. You owe them the truth. Walk.Utilitarianism is another type of hedonism. It declares that the only good is happiness and that happiness is a measure of the pleasure and pain we feel. The goal of life should be to maximise pleasure and minimise pain in any society.Now, there are problems here. What counts as pleasure? Is there a hierarchy in which some pleasures (such as cricket) get more points than others (such as golf)? How do we measure these pleasures? Can we impose our judgments on others? Can we force people to be happy in accordance with our own conceptions of happiness?Despite these problems, utilitarianism is the best hope we have for finding a genuinely rational way to think about morality. In any given situation we have a duty to ponder seriously on the likely consequences and to do our best to minimise harm and promote wellbeing. One possible advantage of Kant’s system is that we don’t have to think: we just apply the rule that says never lie. With utilitarianism, we have to continually assess the outcomes of our actions.I’m not sure that this is a bad thing. To be a moral person we must constantly engage with these problems. And so the utilitarian would, on feeling that edge, quickly assess various factors: the state of the game, the nature of the opposition, their own mental condition, as well as that of the other 21 players. And he or she will then decide which choice will lead to the greatest happiness for the greatest number.It’s not entirely straightforward but, there is something that may help in the decision-making process. As someone who has batted and bowled, I can confirm that the pain of being out is greater than the pleasure of taking a wicket. So, in most circumstances, the utilitarian does not walk.Anyone who thinks about morality these days does so in the shadow of Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900). Nietzsche argued with great force and panache that morality is always a matter of power, a way of asserting your will. What is right is what those in charge, or those who want to be in charge, say to preserve or enhance their own position in society. So morality, specifically Christian morality – all that talk about gentleness and cheek-turning – was a weapon forged by slaves and cowards and weaklings to combat the natural aristocracy of the bold and strong.Nietzsche says we all have to forge our own morality. In this view there is nothing to stop the strong and the brave trampling over the weak and the dim. Nietzsche would not have walked.So where does all this leave our poor batter, still suspended in that moment of judgment? I favour the utilitarians, but philosophy isn’t like maths or physics. The answers are always provisional. The argument never concludes. It’s a timeless Test. But to live a fully human life, a life that engages with the complexity and difficulty of our moral universe, you need to think through the options. So make a choice. What are you – Platonist? Cynic? Sceptic? Stoic? Aristotelian? Kantian? Utilitarian? Nietzschean?

Are things better or worse? These are the questions I am asked constantly as I prepare to give up my job as a nightly aisle-squatter after some 10,000 nights at the theatre. They are difficult to answer. British theatre is incredibly resilient, yet radically different from when I took up my post at the  in 1971. Even the job of being a critic has altered in all sorts of ways.When I joined the paper, a review was normally transmitted in one of two ways. Either you rushed back to the office straight after a show and banged out your copy on a typewriter by 11pm, or you frantically sought a working phone box and spelled out your 350 words to an easily bored copy-taker. (This helps to explain why my predecessor woke up one morning to find his review of The Merchant of Venice featured a character called Skylark.) Now, you tap out the review on a laptop and it whizzes through the ether in a fraction of a second. The deadline has also shifted – unless the show is extremely hot news, as when a Cumberbatch or Branagh plays Hamlet – to 9.30am the morning after the first night. That means I seem to write much of the review in my sleep, something that may not come as a surprise to regular readers.But if the process – and the people who get to write the reviews – has changed, the role of the critic remains much the same: you still have to describe, interpret and evaluate a theatrical event for readers who were not there and may have no chance of going. You are not writing for scholars, posterity or the cast of the show, although it would be nice if they all read your words. You are addressing that morning’s reader with as much clarity and elegance as you can muster, and seeking to put a transient event in its theatrical and social context. It is a constant challenge that has kept me going for nearly half a century and that has left me feeling that all you can do, in Samuel Beckett’s words, is “fail better”.If the critic’s role has several constants but has changed in multiple ways, the same goes for the theatre. Some things have got better, some worse. If I had to pick out one thing I regret, it would be the virtual disappearance of the regional rep company. Time was when many theatres boasted a permanent ensemble: the most famous was the Liverpool Everyman of the 70s, when Julie Walters, Bill Nighy, Jonathan Pryce, Antony Sher and Pete Postlethwaite were part of a dazzling troupe. Financial constraints and cultural fragmentation make it hard to assemble and retain that kind of team today.I would rather, however, accentuate the positive. One thing that has emerged in my lifetime is the move towards gender equality. In the first year of my job, I salivated at the prospect of reviewing new plays by Tom Stoppard, Edward Bond, Alan Bennett, David Storey and Alan Ayckbourn. One fact was obvious: they were all men. One of the first features I wrote asked why there were so few female playwrights. I blush now to reread the piece, which offered all kinds of phoney explanations, but at least I felt I was posing the right question.It is one that seems redundant today. I would attribute that partly to Caryl Churchill, who, from early work such as Owners and Objections to Sex and Violence, has acted as a guiding light to aspiring dramatists. Where she led, others followed, including Pam Gems, Charlotte Keatley, Shelagh Stephenson, Bryony Lavery, Catherine Johnson and Winsome Pinnock. Surveying the scene today, what strikes me is that many of the most ambitious, rule-bending plays are by women. Lucy Kirkwood’s The Children, Laura Wade’s The Watsons, Lucy Prebble’s A Very Expensive Poison, Ella Hickson’s Oil, Natasha Gordon’s Nine Night and Lolita Chakrabarti’s Red Velvet are works that tackle a huge range of social, political and historical issues. They also experiment with form in a way that echoes the example of Churchill.Gender equality now affects casting, too. There have long been striking examples of gender-flipping. I saw Frances de la Tour play Hamlet in 1980 other performers of the moody Dane include Angela Winkler, Maxine Peake and Ruth Negga, with Cush Jumbo still to come. I have also seen, and admired, Kathryn Hunter and Glenda Jackson as King Lear, as well as a number of single-sex productions, such as the recent Richard II at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse in London, cast entirely with women of colour.It may be a reflection of my age, but I find an inflexible quota system, with a 5050 gender split, more problematic, especially in Shakespeare. A play such as Troilus and Cressida, which explores the latent homoeroticism of male combat, loses more than it gains from gender parity, as a recent RSC production proved. I am, however, always open to persuasion.What I have no hesitation in saying is that greater sexual equality has given criticism a long-overdue shake-up. When I started out, the theatre critics were like a travelling male club, trundling from stall to stall in baggy, egg-stained suits. Today, on any first night, you will see as many female critics as men. I once had the temerity to ask a female colleague if she thought gender made a difference: she suggested that reviews by women were more impressionistic, those by men more conventionally linear. Be that as it may, the glass ceiling in criticism has cracked irrevocably. What is sorely lacking is critics of colour, which is why the appointment of Arifa Akbar as my successor takes on extra significance.In the theatre at large, ersity has made huge advances. There have always been outstanding plays by writers of colour: take Moon on a Rainbow Shawl by Errol John, Skyvers by Barry Reckord and Play Mas by Mustapha Matura. What is striking today is that plays by BAME writers are taking place on main stages, are wide-ranging in theme and derive from a large talent pool: I could make a long list, but Bola Agbaje, Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti, Tanika Gupta, debbie tucker green, Kwame Kwei-Armah and Roy Williams represent a rising new generation.There would be shock and outrage today if you saw a classic revival with an all-white cast. The days when black actors were confined, in Shakespeare, to playing Othello or Aaron the Moor in Titus Andronicus are long gone. I have seen actors such as Sophie Okonedo, Sharon D Clarke, Cecilia Noble, Hugh Quarshie, Adrian Lester, David Oyelowo and Chiwetel Ejiofor prove they can play anything and everything. All this represents real progress. The mantra of all self-respecting companies right now is, of course, to create a theatre that represents the infinite variety of the British public. Who could argue with that? But I get nervous when I hear an Arts Council desk-wallah say that, when it comes to funding, “relevance takes precedence over excellence”. That strikes me as a ludicrous false dichotomy. No amount of outreach, community or educational activity will be of any use if the work itself is not first-rate.I am often asked how playwriting has changed in my time. One thing I have learned over the years is that politics and aesthetics are theatrically inisible and that the plays that make the most impact are invariably the best written. A few examples will have to suffice. David Edgar’s Destiny (1976) memorably caught what Dennis Potter called “the nostalgia, the disappointment, the dumbly aching resentments” of the extreme right in Britain. Churchill’s Top Girls (1982) pinned down the contradictions of a Thatcherite philosophy where public advance was achieved at private cost. Pravda (1985), by Howard Brenton and David Hare, not only exposed the newspaper industry’s craven submission to Rupert Murdoch, but the perilous isolation of power. The Colour of Justice (1999), edited by Richard Norton-Taylor from the transcripts of the Macpherson report into the killing of Stephen Lawrence, revealed the layers of institutional racism within the politan police as inexorably as a Greek tragedy. James Graham’s This House (2012) grippingly portrayed the daily machinations of Westminster politics while implicitly putting the case for electoral reform.What fascinates me is the way plays uncannily reflect the temper of the times you can chart Britain since the second world war through the history of its theatre. That is still true: the social isions created by Brexit, the problems of identity politics and the exponential rise in mental illness are constant dramatic themes.The most radical change has been in dramatic form. When I started out, there was a rough consensus as to what constituted a play. Admittedly, some writers were pushing the envelope: Ayckbourn showed in How the Other Half Loves that you could put overlapping action in two households on to a single stage John McGrath in The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil used the form of a ceilidh to promote a message about the exploitation of Scotland’s resources.Who today can say, with total and unshakeable confidence, what a play is? Harold Pinter pointed the way, showing in One for the Road (1984) that in slightly more than 30 minutes you could offer as powerful a portrait of tyranny as anything in Arthur Koestler. Now, the pungent one-act piece that provides a metaphor for the wider world is everywhere: Churchill’s Far Away, Mike Bartlett’s Cock, Sarah Kane’s 4.48 Psychosis and Jez Butterworth’s The River, to name just a few. What is true of Britain is also true of the US. F Scott Fitzgerald said there are no second acts in American lives and now there are few second acts in American plays.Yet you can immediately contradict that by pointing to our corresponding appetite for the inordinate. Matthew Lopez’s The Inheritance is in two parts, lasting six and a half hours. Butterworth can also write long, as he proved in Jerusalem and The Ferryman. Right now, April De Angelis’s two-part version of Elena Ferrante’s My Brilliant Friend is playing at the National Theatre. The old rule that a play was an event lasting 150 minutes, with an interval, has been thrown out of the window. Today, form follows function a play can be as long or as short as its subject dictates.I have dwelled so long on playwriting that I have said too little about other aspects of theatre. Has acting significantly altered during my tenure? I would say it has, in accordance with changes in taste, technology and dramaturgy. One of the first pieces I wrote for the  was a celebration of three great performances: Laurence Olivier in Eugene O’Neill’s Long Day’s Journey Into Night, Paul Scofield in Carl Zuckmayer’s The Captain of Köpenick and Ralph Richardson in John Osborne’s West of Suez. Great acting still exists, but in a different form. Classics are often re-gendered. Living dramatists tend to write, with obvious exceptions, democratically structured plays rather than ones built around star parts. The influence of the TV camera, as well as the ubiquity of studio theatres, means actors are trained to communicate through small gestures. To put it simply, the ironic has replaced the heroic.One of the pleasures of a critic’s job – as well as one of its greatest challenges – is trying to describe performances. I have been lucky to have seen some unforgettable ones. It is impossible to list them all, but I would like to mention a few that remain part of my imperishable memory: John Wood, and later Tom Hollander, relishing the intellectual acrobatics of Henry Carr in Stoppard’s Travesties Ian McKellen and Judi Dench as the Macbeths in Trevor Nunn’s grippingly intimate production Eileen Atkins as the fiercely independent Maddy Rooney in Beckett’s All That Fall Maggie Smith capturing the piercing recollections, as well as the moral evasiveness, of the heroine in A German Life Simon Russell Beale conveying the troubled testiness of Shakespeare’s Prospero and Mark Rylance the whimsical passion of Olivia Paapa Essiedu and David Tennant both highlighting the quick-wittedness and humour of Hamlet in different RSC productions. I could go on and on. One of British theatre’s prime assets is its ability to produce, decade after decade, new generations of exciting actors.If there is an aspect of theatre of which I have been critical in recent years, it lies in the elevation of the director to the role of supreme creative artist. I should add quickly that I am not remotely anti-director. I was brought up on the work of Peter Brook, Tyrone Guthrie and Joan Littlewood. I could also list numerous instances where a director has given me new insight into a familiar work. At the start of my career, John Barton directed a Richard II that, by having Ian Richardson and Richard Pasco alternate the roles of Richard and Bolingbroke, saw them as tragic parallels rather than the usual polar opposites. Last year, Marianne Elliott gave us a whole new perspective on Stephen Sondheim’s Company by turning it into a story of a modern woman’s (rather than a man’s) quest for a permanent relationship. My quarrel lies with directors who see themselves as creators rather than interpreters – a byproduct of the fact that many of them, in order to make a living, frequently work in Germany, where the theatre is far better funded and the director is regarded as god.But I have no wish to end on a sour note. I count myself lucky to have been witness to an amazing period in British theatre. I shall probably go on haunting playhouses until I fall off my perch. We hear a lot about the death of criticism, but I believe passionately in its unending mission to record, interpret and evaluate what happens on stages. The means of communication may change in the light of evolving technology, but the function remains the same. I have been privileged to do the job for the past 48 years, but, as I move from the world of daily deadlines to that of periodic commentary, I can only wish my successor the same good fortune I have enjoyed. In the words of Hector in Bennett’s The History Boys, I am happy to pass the parcel.Michael Billington will be talking to Arifa Akbar at a  Live event at Kings Place, London, on 3 February"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4f489ef9d63de5a7be2f3157dd6767158c553a2/0_115_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45e38972f9a06a80d248bb14227adeaa","title":"ex facebook worker claims disturbing content led to ptsd","story":"Former moderator suing social network in Ireland over health impact of scouring websiteA former Facebook moderator is suing the company, alleging that his work scouring the site of violent and obscene content caused his post-traumatic stress disorder.Chris Gray, who now works as a tour guide, is seeking damages from both Facebook Ireland and CPL, the contracting firm that directly employed him. The case, filed on Wednesday in the Irish high court in Dublin, is thought to be the first time a former moderator has taken the social network to court.According to court documents, Gray’s work required him to review “approximately a thousand tickets per night”, initially focused on pornography, and later “on content that had been reported as being threatening, hateful, bullying, or otherwise dangerous”.Two years on, a number of specific pieces of content remain “particularly marked” in his memory, the legal writ says, including “a video in which a woman wearing an abaya is seen being stoned to death”, “a video in which persons, who appear to be migrants in Libya, are tortured with molten metal”, and “video footage of dogs being cooked alive”.Aggravating the trauma, Gray’s lawyers argue, was the fact that the nature of the work required him to “obsess” over particular videos. Facebook and CPL “valued accuracy … above all else”, and tracked whether inidual calls were made correctly or not. But the system did not allow moderators “to hold or skip a ticket pending a decision from above”, requiring them instead to focus deeply on particular pieces of content, often featuring violent or upsetting material.Speaking to the  before the case was filed, Gray said: “You would wake up and you’re remembering the video of someone machine-gunning people in the Middle East somewhere, trying to think whether there was an Isis flag, and so whether it should be marked as terrorism-related or not.“It took me a year after I left to realise how much I’d been affected by the job. I don’t sleep well, I get in stupid arguments, have trouble focusing.”Gray is being supported in his case by Foxglove, an international NGO that backs efforts to hold big tech to account through the legal system. Cori Crider, Foxglove’s director, said: “The reason we’ve got involved is that we think that social media factory floors are unsafe and need to be cleared up. In a decade we’re going to look back on this as we did at meat packing plants at the turn of the century.“Facebook’s only going to pay attention to things when they know that they’ve got a typhoon bearing down on them. What I’d like to see is the moderators realising how much power they have if they just organise. Because let’s face it, social media as we know it could not exist without the labour people like Chris provide.”In October, leaked audio from a Facebook all-staff meeting revealed Mark Zuckerberg describing reports about poor working conditions in the company’s moderation centres as “a little overdramatic”.“From digging into them and understanding what’s going on, it’s not that most people are just looking at just terrible things all day long,” Zuckerberg told employees. “But there are really bad things that people have to deal with, and making sure that people get the right counselling and space and ability to take breaks and get the mental-health support that they need is a really important thing. It’s something we’ve worked on for years and are always trying to probe and understand how we can do a better job to support that.”A Facebook spokesperson said: “We are committed to providing support for those that review content for Facebook as we recognise that reviewing certain types of content can sometimes be difficult. Everyone who reviews content for Facebook goes through an in-depth, multi-week training program on our Community Standards and has access to extensive psychological support to ensure their wellbeing. This includes 247 on-site support with trained practitioners, an on-call service, and access to private healthcare from the first day of employment. We are also employing technical solutions to limit their exposure to graphic material as much as possible. This is an important issue, and we are committed to getting this right.”CPL have been contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/298e5e6b0fae08398de24318f65f175e22b7382b/0_377_5656_3394/master/5656.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9f515132ced9e6aef55cf5b23ca131b","title":"secret vault room edinburgh new hostel","story":"A centuries’ old vault has been turned into a ‘very well soundproofed’ room at a new hostel in the Scottish capital How does a hostel stand out from the crowd? Sometimes by embracing novelty. A former courthouse in London threw off the shackles to become Clink in Reykjavik the crumbs of a biscuit factory were swept away to create Kex and in Amsterdam, one of the city’s most famous brothels has a new life as Cocomama. Now, an Edinburgh hostel looks to be upping the ante by turning what was once a secret vault into a room with just enough space for a double bed behind the original six-inch steel safe door.What has become the Vault room – a mere 3.2 sq m, and retaining its foot-thick walls – was discovered by architects during redevelopment work at a former fruit and vegetable market in the Scottish capital’s Old Town. It is now set to act as a showpiece room in the new 139-bed hostel, part of the St Christopher’s Inn chain, which opened in late November.Described as “very well soundproofed”, the Vault’s hefty door is said to weigh more than a tonne, though any jangling nerves should to be calmed by news it has been welded open to avoid trapping travellers. The room features specially designed wallpaper that depicts rows of safety deposit boxes and has a safe that serves as a fun, in-room gaming experience. An en suite bathroom has been fitted outside the vault door. Designed in conjunction with local escape room specialist Escape Reality, the challenge is to crack the code of the safe and in the process release some goodies for your stay.“The entire room is basically a large, walk-in safe,” according to Sophie Herbert, marketing director of St Christopher’s Inns’ parent company Beds and Bars. “Our best guess is that it was a vault for cash takings from the days when the site was a flourishing fruit and veg market serving the city. Certainly, it would have been almost impregnable.”The new hostel, which is opposite the existing St Christopher’s Inn property and close to the city’s Waverley station, is in a two-storey structure on Market Street that dates back to the late 1800s. Its 139 beds are spread across 18 rooms that have been themed around different areas of the city. There are private rooms, such as the Vault, and dorms for up to 12 people. Prices for beds start from £9.90 a night B\u0026ampB in low season to £68 a night B\u0026ampB for a private double in high season.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

The most life-affirming Christmas advert of 2019 is here – and it’s for a tiny family-run hardware store in WalesThis year’s John Lewis Christmas advert, in which a dragon tries to kill several people then holds up a pudding, reportedly cost £7m to make. And that’s fine. It’s a good advert, and John Lewis has a reputation to uphold, and you can’t really put a price on the half a morning of vaguely duty-bound Twitter buzz it generated.However, by no means is it the best Christmas ad this year. That plaudit now goes to Hafod Hardware, a tiny independent family-run hardware store in Rhayader, Powys, whose ad cost just £100 to make. Quite frankly, it blows John Lewis out of the water.Here’s what happens. A little boy wakes up. He brushes his teeth, eats his breakfast and goes to work. He opens the shop, fixes a broom he cleans the counter and restocks the shelves. He serves a customer, does a bit of accounting, serves another customer. At the end of the day he switches off the light, bends down to pick up a Christmas tree and – PLOT TWIST! – he’s actually a 30-year-old man. The strapline comes up: ‘Be a kid this Christmas’. The end.Judging by the YouTube comments under the video, there is not a dry eye in the house. The advert is being hailed as a celebration of traditional Christmas spirit, the strength of the independent, and the importance of community. It’s been featured in the national media as an antidote to the aggressive willy-waving we see from brands at this time of year.Which it is and it isn’t, in truth. While it’s impressive that the shop has only spent £100 on the ad – and that was to pay for an engineer to record the song on the soundtrack – it still manages to crib pretty heavily from the John Lewis playbook. There’s a kid. There’s a tree. There’s a slowed-down cover version of a well-loved song. The only thing stopping it from being a John Lewis advert is the lack of a very polite man whose name is also Hafod Hardware politely redirecting Twitter users to the correct account.But let’s not be too mean-spirited. The fact is that the Hafod Hardware advert packs an almighty punch, because of the history of the shop itself. It has been open since 1895, fending off competition from bigger companies with every step and it’s a true family shop, passed down through the generations. The grandfather in the advert is the nephew of the founder, the man at the end (his son) runs the shop with him and the little boy could feasibly grow up to run the shop after him. Any old idiot can get a kid to sweep up a shop, but the magic of the ad is that it shows the real flesh and blood lineage of Hafod Hardware. It’s the beating heart of the community, and has been for years. No amount of money can buy that.So maybe it’s time for John Lewis to follow suit. Every year its Christmas adverts drift further and further from its core brand – quite often you’re lucky if the ads actually feature anything you can buy in-store – and it seems clear that things aren’t working. This year the company unveiled its first ever half-year loss, and it isn’t like these things have a habit of improving. Maybe next year it can find a way to use its Christmas ad to remind people what the shop was, and what it meant to people. If it can connect even half as well as the Hafod Hardware ad, it’ll be on to a winner. Especially if it only costs them £100."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06602c0e5e91900e4e6cc6ac5cf60f3763abd534/0_124_2373_1423/master/2373.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a158a42b36e016ece53cb49c80ee41cd","title":"germanys spd steps back from pulling plug on merkel coalition","story":"Social Democrats’ new leaders shrink from rushed exit from governing allianceThe new leftwing leadership of Germany’s Social Democrats have sounded a cautious note over hastening the breakup of Angela Merkel’s coalition government, dampening speculation that the troubled party could pull the plug on the government as soon as Friday.In a surprise result, two little-known leftwingers, Norbert Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken, caused an upset at the weekend when they won the leadership vote of the world’s oldest social democratic party, a move that seemed to signal a rejection of the party’s centrist “third way” phase initiated under the former chancellor Gerhard Schröder.The result came as a shock not only to the widely expected winner, Germany’s deputy chancellor and finance minister, Olaf Scholz, but also to the victorious pair and their supporters.The new leaders, both critics of the SPD’s “grand coalition” with Merkel’s centre-right party, had said throughout their leadership campaign that a decision on the future of the governing alliance would be made at this weekend’s party conference in Berlin.But the latest draft for Friday’s main motion, agreed between Esken, Walter-Borjans, Scholz and the interim leader, Malu Dreyer, seems designed to put the break on a rushed exit by tasking the new leadership merely to “seek a dialogue” with Merkel’s CDU about measures to stabilise Germany’s slowing economy and amend an already agreed climate package.The 67-year-old political economist who joined the SPD at the age of 31, has sometimes been referred to as Germany\u0027s Bernie Sanders for his insistence that the SPD must lead the country out of the neoliberal wilderness. He has said the SPD had drifted into believing that lower taxes and VAT rises were the best way to run the country, and he would look to reverse this thinking, in the unlikely event he was elected co-leader.The father of four who paints and sculpts in his spare time, earned a reputation as a risk taker willing to take on the rich and powerful during his time as finance minister in North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany´s most populous state, when he paid €19 million for CDs containing whistleblower\u0027s data on thousands of Swiss bank clients. The move prompted tens of thousands to voluntarily pay back €7.2bn in unpaid taxes.In an interview with the  last month, Walter-Borjans - often referred to as NoWaBo for short - said the country was in need of a large amount of investment and that he would rather Germany abandoned its commitment to balancing the federal budget, the so-called black zero, to free up money for this. If the economy does indeed enter a downturn then we will need to make massive investments. Because our infrastructure is not in a good state, and nor is our digital infrastructure nor our schools. We have to question the black zero.”\u0026nbspThe 58-year-old from Baden-Württemberg is even less well known than her male counterpart. She joined the SPD at the age of 29, and has been in the Bundestag since 2013, taking a clear left-wing position, and like Walter-Borjans also critical of the SPD´s neoliberal politics under Gerhard Schröder, and voting against a tightening of the government\u0027s extradition policy, but has largely remained low-profile.\u0026nbspMarried with three children, she counts among her hobbies woodland walks with her dog, as well as music and literature.During the campaign as well as criticising the grand coalition, she made a particular point of stressing the need for reform of the European Union including introducing a Union-wide fiscal policy including cracking down on tax evasion.\u0026nbspIn a move designed to mend relations between leftwing and centrist factions in the SPD, the  understands the wording of the motion could lead to Scholz and other ministers being invited to join the talks.Kevin Kühnert, the hoodie-wearing leader of the SPD youth wing, who is seen as one of the architects of Esken and Walter-Borjan’s shock victory, has also appeared to cool on the prospect of an exit from the grand coalition, known as “GroKo”.“If you leave a coalition, you end up giving up a degree of control,” Kühnert told the Rheinische Post newspaper in an interview. “SPD delegates should bear that in mind too when they made up their mind.”“If need be, I am not afraid to go into an election with the SPD in the next three months,” said Kühnert, who is in the running to be voted deputy leader at the weekend. But many party insiders question whether the leftwingers calling the shots have the right staff and action-ready strategy to go into fresh elections early next year.Another reason why even seasoned GroKo critics are reluctant to bring down the current government is that it has yet to implement one the SPD’s totemic projects, a raising of the basic pension for low-income workers employed all their lives.Yet the risk of a chaotic end to Merkel’s fourth term in office remains. Apart from formally voting in Esken and Walter-Borjans as new leaders, delegates could propose and pass a motion to ditch the government’s commitment to balanced budgets, the so-called schwarze Null (“black zero”).A strongly worded motion committing SPD ministers to further spending could push the more fiscally conservative finance minister Scholz to throw in the towel, unravelling Merkel’s current cabinet.Walter-Borjans told the  in an interview last month that driving Germany to commit to more spending would be a defining issue of his leadership.“If the economy does indeed enter a downturn then we will need to make massive investments. Because our infrastructure is not in a good state, and nor is our digital infrastructure nor our schools. We have to question the black zero,” said Walter-Borjans, a former finance minister of the state of North-Rhine Westphalia.“If that doesn’t work with our coalition partner then that’s not a good sign.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab43d3711038cc4820cca08811531127ad5999f6/0_28_4897_2938/master/4897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15efab9a4a7b0971b9b63f97e84271a7","title":"nato at 70 macron manspreading and melania dressed as a ukip moth","story":"As leaders gathered in Watford for the alliance’s 70th birthday, we take a look at the goings on, outfits, clashes and gossiping sessionsThe last time a group of underachievers with an increasingly shoddy commitment to defence stayed at a “luxury resort” in Watford, it was the England football team. On Tuesday, the leaders of the Nato nations arrived to celebrate the alliance’s 70th birthday. Seventy, coincidentally, is about the average age of the leaders.Conversation at the mini-summit included how to mess up the Syria situation further, while conversation later at Buckingham Palace, behind Trump’s back, was about how awful he is. Now, I’m no fan of Trump, but watching Justin Trudeau instigating this gossip session leaves you with the impression he is definitely the guy who screengrabs your comments in the WhatsApp group and shadily shares them with others.Here’s a look at what else went down. Apologies in advance.Here we have Emmanuel Macron, taking us back to our school days when we all passed notes to friends sat behind us in class. In Macron’s case, they would have been about how fit the teacher was. Incidentally, can we all agree that the most annoying thing teachers did was say: “Well, why didn’t you go at break?” As if that wasn’t 45 minutes ago and you didn’t need the loo then.This is a vision of the only thing that could possibly be worse than what we have currently in the UK. And for that, at least, we thank GodIn all seriousness, can someone please buy Boris Johnson a hairbrush? He doesn’t look like he has been dragged through a hedge backwards he looks like the hedge. Remember when Wella tried to make the Messed Up look a thing (the actual product name), thinking it gave off vibes of the morning after a night of amazing sex? In fact it looked like someone who had been strapped to the electric chair, the switch flipped and only then had been granted a reprieve. The gel of the moment is named Ultra Strong Mess Constructor, which is precisely what Johnson is.Did I tell a lie?From the back, the look switched to Dementor-but-into-Klaxons. The 00s nu-ravers who favoured neon not the devices to signal danger. Though, having said that, Melania would surely be a fan of those, too. #FreeMelania. In the background of this pic, we have her husband apparently struggling to button up his coat, and Macron emulating the strutting Leonardo DiCaprio meme.Here Melania pays tribute to her favourite author and illustrator, the late, great Edward Gorey, by dressing up as one of his most famous characters. One of Gorey’s well-loved stories is The Doubtful Guest, which tells the tale of a creature that rocks up, stays for 17 years and “shows no intention of going away”. Basically: Putin.I feel like this is what you see before you die. And if you do, you know that you are certainly not going to heaven, or at least purgatory. Because you are already – and I cannot stress this enough – in hell. Look at the mouth. It’s like a drawstring bag made of slugs.This is a group of contestants on The X Factor. None of them have made it through to the inidual categories, but they have been put together as a group. They’re not happy about it, but the dream of possibly nailing a Christmas No 1 before hitting No 27 in the charts with their follow-up single is too big a draw.I have no idea who the gentleman on the left is, but what I can say is: he is all of us.It’s truly stunning that the classic misogynist slur is that women need to keep their legs shut, when men are seemingly physically incapable of this act. Whether it’s straddling a bus seat or taking up all available space under a dining table, it’s a constant. It should also not go unnoticed that the majority of the people in this photograph are white men, and pretty much the only one I’m appreciating is Miloš Zeman, president of the Czech Republic.

I have no idea why every woman in the picture is wearing purple, but I respect it also.You look at this picture, see a politician in the pitch black, wearing a suit and naturally assume it is Matt Hancock. Then you see it is in fact the Turkish autocrat and abuser of human rights Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and breathe a sigh of relief.There is no picture of Angela Merkel that doesn’t look like she is striding away from the pack of people at least 18 grades of intelligence below her, heading straight to her hotel room, locking her door, switching her phone to airplane mode and curling up with a biography of Richard Feynman.

It intends to use J-Village, a sports complex located about 12 miles from the nuclear plant that was damaged in the disaster, as the starting point for the Japan leg of the torch relay taking place in March.Originally designed as a training centre for athletes, J-Village functioned for years as a logistics hub for crews working to control and decommission the defunct reactors.After a cleanup process, the sports centre became fully operational again in April this year, shortly after the torch relay decision.Greenpeace urged fresh radiation monitoring and continued cleanup efforts, saying it had detected some spots with radiation levels as high as 1.7 microsieverts per hour when measured one metre above the surface.This compared with the national safety standard of 0.23 microsieverts per hour, and a normal reading in Tokyo of about 0.04 microsieverts per hour. The hotspots showed a reading of 71 microsieverts per hour at the surface level, Greenpeace said.However, J-Village’s website said the radiation reading at its main entrance was 0.111 microsieverts per hour on Wednesday, while one of its fields showed a reading of 0.085 microsieverts per hour.The Tokyo Electric Power Company, which operates the Fukushima plant, said it cleaned the spots on Tuesday after the environment ministry told the firm about them.Greenpeace said it relayed its findings to the Japanese government as well as local and international Olympic organisers.

I LOVE YOU.”Using flight and corporate records, the veteran whistleblower has argued that Russian officials are quietly reassigning aircraft from the Kremlin-run bank VTB to offshore companies in order to fly their significant others on expensive vacations to Europe and business trips in Russia.“Your wife uses a private jet Bombardier 5000 which costs $50m. She flew for many hours … Who paid for this? Whose jet is it?” Navalny said, addressing Medvedev, in a video, released ahead of an annual press conference held by the former Russian president and ally of Vladimir Putin.In a separate viral video released earlier this week, Navalny claimed that Andrey Kostin, the head of VTB Bank, had similarly appropriated a Bombardier Global 6000 business jet and a yacht for his reported girlfriend, Nailya Asker-Zade, a prominent television journalist on state-run Russia-24.Asker-Zade had also mysteriously acquired a Moscow apartment and a suburban mansion worth at least $4m, according to Navalny.Asker-Zade has disputed the account and responded sarcastically to Navalny’s post, writing on Instagram that she had “ordered native advertising from a popular blogger and didn’t realise it would become so popular. Welcome to my new followers!”Describing the appropriated aircraft as a “two-for-one” sale, Navalny has claimed that the use of aircraft valued at $500,000 per month would violate the law against illegal enrichment for officials.Using flight data and corporate records, Navalny’s Fund Against Corruption reported that Asker-Zade’s photos posted to Instagram matched flight details for the approximately $60m jet and 62-metre Sea \u0026amp Us super-yacht. The investigators also identified a plaque on a bench in New York City’s Central Park worth upwards of $10,000 that appeared to be a gift from Asker-Zade to Kostin.“Andrey Kostin, Don’t forget we are of the same blood. I LOVE YOU, NAILYA 2015,” the bench plaque reads.While the couple’s relationship is a poorly kept secret in Moscow, Russian print and television media have largely avoided covering their romance. Articles about the investigation have since been purged from state-run wires Tass and Ria Novosti and Vedomosti, a popular business newspaper, was criticised by for failing to cover the investigation.The owner of Vedomosti denied that censorship played a role in the decision not to feature the scandal but called it a “regrettable, shameful fact” that the paper ignored the investigation.The video, which has earned more than 3.5m views, has been a viral hit for Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, the opposition politician’s media and investigative unit, which was blacklisted in October as a “foreign agent” in an effort to halt its activities. A 2017 video about Medvedev’s properties helped spark anti-Kremlin protests that saw tens of thousands of mainly young Muscovites protest in downtown Moscow.The Kremlin declined to respond to questions about Navalny’s video, saying it had not seen the investigations. has approached Andrey Kostin for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e6542d95a3f3f1d8c4b48542c8a8a12ecfd95de/0_18_2039_1223/master/2039.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2277e3b14f624d55e2d5d5e20578b098","title":"turkey agrees to back nato plan for baltic states and poland","story":"Nato chief says Ankara has dropped opposition to plan as fractious London summit draws to closeTurkey has dropped its opposition to a plan to bolster the defences of Baltic states and Poland against Russia, the Nato secretary general has said, as the alliance attempted to paper over the cracks at the end of a summit in London.Jens Stoltenberg told a press conference that Nato leaders did not discuss the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which Turkey views as a terrorist organisation.Before the summit marking the 70th anniversary of Nato, Ankara had refused to back a Nato defence plan for the Baltics and Poland until it received more support for its battle with the YPG, including other alliance members recognising it as a terrorist group.The\u0026nbspNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) is a collective defence alliance between 29 North American and European countries. Founded in 1949, the treaty provides that if one country is attacked, all Nato members would collectively respond. Nato was set up to counter the threat of the Soviet Union.\u0026nbspThe 12 founding members were: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, United Kingdom and the United States.Over the years the organisation has expanded to its\u0026nbspcurrent membership of 29. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, North Macedonia and Ukraine are recognised as states with aspirations to join.This week\u0027s summit marks a celebration of the 70th anniversary of the organisation. London was chosen partly because it was the location of the original headquarters of the organisation when it was founded.\u0026nbspDuring the two-day gathering there will be addresses by the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, a formal reception at Buckingham Palace hosted by the Queen, and a meeting of the North Atlantic Council attended by heads of state and government. The agenda features discussions about Russia, China and the future of arms control. There will also be a series of bilateral meetings between leaders - the most testing of which are likely to feature Turkey\u0027s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan looking for support for his country\u0027s recent incursion into Syria.Infighting is a major issue. For the third summit in a row, Donald Trump is expected to renew demands that European allies and Canada step up defence spending. He is also unhappy with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, over a tax on American tech giants including Google, Amazon and Facebook.For his part Macron has lamented Nato\u0027s brain death due to a lack of US leadership, and said the organisation needs a wake-up call. He insists that strategic questions must be addressed, like improving ties with Russia and how to handle an unpredictable ally like Turkey.\u0026nbspIn turn, Erdoğan has lashed out at Macron. Their very public argument bodes ill for the summit, which is being hosted by the British prime minister, Boris Johnson. Johnson will want who to smooth things over and downplay any links to Trump, who is unpopular in the UK.Stoltenberg also said that Nato was in favour of dialogue and a better relationship with Russia, and believed that China should be part of future arms limitations or reductions talks.Nato leaders, he said, had agreed to set up a committee of experts to analyse political decision-making after the French president Emmanuel Macron lamented the “brain death” of the military alliance.In a communique the leaders agreed to “a forward-looking reflection process” – a mechanism that allowed Turkey to lift its threat to block the plans for the Baltics and Poland.The Syrian Kurds had formed the backbone of the western fight against Islamic State in Syria, and the French in particular were furious that Donald Trump had sanctioned their betrayal by giving a green light to Turkey’s incursion into Syria in October.Stoltenberg said the reflection process would be led by him, adding that the definition of the YPG had not been discussed. He praised Turkey for endorsing the Baltic plan, saying: “We were able to take decisions and to move this alliance forward. All allies have agreed the commitment to article 5, which is one for all and all for one and that is an iron-clad commitment.”The Nato review is likely to last a year, by which time it will be clear whether Trump, a disruptor of Nato for the past three years, will have been re-elected.Macron believes a gradual American disengagement from the protection of Europe will continue regardless of the White House occupant, and the European defence pillar, inside and outside of Nato needs to be strengthened.Despite the open disagreements over issues such as foreign fighters in Syria and the role of Turkey within the alliance, Macron and Trump agree that European levels of defence spending needs to rise and Russia has the potential to become a closer partner if disputes in Ukraine can be settled.Many other European states, notably Poland, the Baltics, Germany and the UK do not share Macron’s assessment of Russia. Those doubts were underscored by the German decision to expel two Russian diplomats in protest over what it said was Moscow’s lack of cooperation in an investigation into the murder of a Georgian man in Berlin, in which prosecutors suspect Russian or Chechen involvement.In a statement Nato said Russia’s “aggressive actions” constitute a threat to Euro-Atlantic security, and that China’s growing influence presented opportunities and challenges for the alliance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1468ec32e2df3020a758c848b949b7b79d1e8c9/0_170_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e17659e75fbf93477b97459f4c4c5d6","title":"help us locate benin bronze statues in the uk","story":"We would like to start locating these objects and mapping their journeys to Britain – and we need your helpJesus College Cambridge has agreed to return a Benin bronze statue to Nigeria, after it was taken by British colonial forces from the country in the late nineteenth century.The artefact is set to be one of the first Benin bronzes returned to Nigeria, after thousands were stolen from Benin City in a punitive 1897 expedition by British forces.The decision to return the artefact comes after increasing scrutiny of the origins of our museum collections, and a growing movement to repatriate objects taken from former British colonies.Objects in national collections including the British Museum and the V\u0026ampA cannot be returned to their countries of origin because they are protected by the Heritage Act.

The basic value of the company’s support annually was put at €1.8 million when the partnership was last renewed in 2015.The telecoms company’s deal was due to expire in July and, in a statement on Wednesday, Three said it had decided not to renew the contract when it comes to an end.The company said that it has supported Irish football for the last 10 years, investing €30 million in the game through a series of sponsorships and other measures.The announcement is the latest financial body blow to the FAI, which has been at the centre of a controversy since March after revelations about its finances and the relationship between it and former chief executive John Delaney. AccountsThe FAI is set to publish accounts on Thursday detailing its finances for last year. The accounts, which will confirm the size of the exit package given to Mr Delaney earlier this year, are also expected to show a dramatic reversal in the organisation’s financial health. Sport Ireland referred an in-depth audit of the FAI’s accounts to the gardaí late last month.Three Ireland’s chief commercial officer Elaine Carey said the decision was taken after a review of its sponsorship portfolio. “At Three, we are entirely focussed on supporting the Irish men’s team through what we hope will be an exciting and successful qualification for the UEFA European Football Championship and the Irish Women’s team in their qualification for the the UEFA Women’s European Championship. We also wish the Irish teams at ever level the very best in the future.” In its statement, Three said the decision had been taken for strategic reasons and there was no reference to the recent troubles at the association “Having recently reviewed our full sponsorship portfolio,” said the firm’s Chief Commercial Officer, Elaine Carey, “we have decided to consolidate our sponsorship investment in the area of music”. Ms Carey went on to say that the firm remains committed to supporting the association’s various teams for the remainder of the deal and wished them all well beyond that.The news comes just a day before the FAI is due to publish its accounts for 2018, the compilation of which has been severely delayed due to the many controversy that engulfed the association through the early part of the year and the lengthy re-examination of the organisation’s longer term finances that was embarked upon as a consequence. The amount of notice given means that the FAI has eight months to find a replacement but it is hard to quantify the damage that has been done to its own brand and how that might affect the value of any subsequent deal with another company.The association had clearly been told by Three of the company’s intentions before the news was announced publicly and staff at the association were informed on Wednesday afternoon. Speaking to The  only last week, in the days before his return to UEFA, then FAI general manager Noel Mooney listed the fact that the association had not lost one of its big sponsors (Ford’s departure and the arrival of Nissan was seen as being linked to the respective parent companies’ wider international strategies) due to all of the adverse publicity events at Abbotstown had generated as one of the successes of his six month stint back in Dublin."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4100944.1575203275!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish man wins 170km mountain race through oman","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Eoin Keith (51) from Dublin crossed the finished line after 36 hours, 4 minutes and 29 seconds. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            An Irish man has won a two-day, 170km race through the Al Hajar mountain range in OmanAn Irish man has won a two-day, 170km race through the Al Hajar mountain range in Oman. Eoin Keith (51) from Dublin crossed the finished line of the OMAN by UTMB race after 36 hours, 4 minutes and 29 seconds. The Dublin man was one of 2,000 participants from 69 countries ranging from six- to-87- years- old. The trail included two steep ascents including Jebel Akhdar, known as the Green Mountain, and 3,000m high Jebel Shams, one of the highest points on the Arabian peninsula.After his win, Mr Keith said: “It was so technical, possibly the most technical race I’ve ever done. There was a long 1,000m descent which you normally would expect to make tons of time on but we were so slow. “It makes it easier to keep going mentally because it’s so technical that you need to concentrate pretty much the entire time.“ There’s no real let up mentally and it was intense racing all the way. But very enjoyable, Oman is a gorgeous country and the mountains are truly spectacular.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4104775.1575479855!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eastwood says election about sinn f%C3%A9in empty seats and dup empty promises","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSDLP leader Colum Eastwood during the launch in Derry of the SDLP manifesto for the  British general  election. Photograph:  Margaret McLaughlinThe Westminster general election is about “Sinn Féin empty seats and DUP empty promises”, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said in Derry on Wednesday when launching the party’s manifesto.Mr Eastwood focused on Sinn Féin’s abstentionist policy from the House of Commons . He said the election “was an opportunity to send voices and votes to Westminster that can stand up for us and stand against the DUP”.On Monday Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said it was “fanciful and frankly dishonest” to say nationalist MPs could have influence in the “house of chaos” at Westminster.However, Mr Eastwood said there was a real risk that if the same pattern of results repeated itself in this election, only the DUP would take seats and hold sway in Westminster. “This election is a chance to maximise the Remain representation across Northern Ireland.” Mr Eastwood said the “threat of Brexit and Boris Johnson” loomed over this election. “There is a tendency in every election to define it as different. But I think people are very aware that this election is not only different – it is potentially decisive.“Turning your back on Brexit and ignoring it won’t prevent it from happening. Preventing it means facing it head on – it means voting against it.” “This election is about Sinn Féin’s empty seats and DUP’s empty promises, but it also has to be about an empty building in Stormont. Not one person in Northern Ireland has benefitted from the stalemate of our politics.” Health crisisHe accused the DUP and Sinn Féin for more than 1,000 days of “abstaining from their responsibility of delivering a government for all of our people”, which had led to the current health crisis.Some unionists have accused the SDLP of engaging in a “sectarian pact” over its decision not to stand in North Belfast, where Sinn Féin candidate John Finucane is seeking to defeat DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds. Sinn Féin is in turn giving SDLP candidate Claire Hanna a clear run in South Belfast.Mr Eastwood insisted the decision was motivated by SDLP support for the Remain position. “The SDLP make no apologies for making difficult decisions that are designed to protect this island and our people from the damage of Brexit.” Foyle is one of the cockpit constituencies where Sinn Féin and the SDLP are in a tight battle for the seat between outgoing MP Elisha McCallion and Mr Eastwood. In 2017 Sinn Féin defeated former SDLP leader Mark Durkan by 169 votes.Mr Eastwood said that a “couple of seats” could be critical in determining who would be in the next British government. Asked could the SDLP support Mr Johnson if doing so would mean British government largesse for Northern Ireland, he replied “no.”Asked would he support Jeremy Corbyn as British prime minister, he said the SDLP wanted to “see a Labour government much more than I want to see a Tory government”, while adding “we will always do whatever we have to do to knock Boris Johnson out of government”. Amnesty for soldiersMr Eastwood said the “Tories are gearing up to try and force through an amnesty for soldiers – which we know by law would in all likelihood extend to and cover all parliamentary organisations”.“This would be the ultimate betrayal of the truth and justice that victims were promised. SDLP MPs will stand by those victims, and ensure that the mutual interests of those who inflicted the violence are not permitted to ride roughshod over the interests of those who suffered as a result of it. SDLP MPs stopped an amnesty before and we’ll do it again.” "},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Conservative party manifesto 2019: summary of key policiesLabour Party manifesto 2019: A summary of key policiesWho should I vote for in the 2019 general election?  Will tactical voting actually work in this election?

How quickly and casually they have removed my name from history – the first black woman to win it. This is what we’ve always been up against, folks.”Evaristo received words of support from fellow authors and journalists, who called the blunder “appalling” and “an unacceptable act of erasure”.\u0026nbspA BBC News spokesperson told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspthat the presenter had forgotten Evaristo’s name while ad-libbing the Booker Prize reference.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The 27 best opening lines in books Show all 27Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.127 Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u0027s Stone by JK RowlingMr. and Mrs. Dursley of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much.227 Rebecca by Daphne Du MaurierLast night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.327 Love in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel García MárquezIt was inevitable: the scent of bitter almonds always reminded him of the fate of unrequited love.427 Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy“Happy families are all alike every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”527 The Great Gatsby by F Scott FitzgeraldIn my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I\u0027ve been turning over in my mind ever since.

It was actually revised up a bit, to 49.3 from a flash estimate of 48.6, which is better than a kick in the teeth.\u0026nbspIt stood at 50 (flat) last month. New business, meanwhile, contracted for the third month in a row, and at the fastest rate since July 2016.\u0026nbspGiven the sector’s dominance, all this bodes ill for the UK economy.\u0026nbspIt hasn’t played much of a role during the General Election but if it carries on like it this\u0026nbspit’ll be getting a lot more attention in the aftermath.\u0026nbspPolitics is behind both the gloomy picture painted of how its biggest component is performing\u0026nbspby the PMI. It’s also behind the pound’s rise from its unhealthy position on the ropes. \u0026nbspCurrency traders think it’s in the bag for Boris Johnson, that he’ll get his dismal “deal” through and that the risks of chaos will be diminished as a result. Not being overly fond of Jeremy Corbyn, they’re also quite pleased to see Labour’s poll ratings becalmed.\u0026nbspThey may be missing the bigger picture given the fraught negotiations on trade that will follow and play a big role in sentiment moving forward. How often does that need repeating? Quite a lot, it seems.\u0026nbspThe UK will simply swapping one form of uncertainty for another if Johnson wins a majority. That helps to explain why the services sector remains so weak and may continue to be weak until there is something resembling clarity on the UK’s relationship with its biggest trading partner.\u0026nbspOne of the many tragedies of Brexit is how little attention\u0026nbspservices were given during the negotiations and how little thought has been directed towards\u0026nbspthe impact Brexit will have on this crucial sector moving forward. A pick up could be some time in coming.Consumer spending, and more government money sloshing around courtesy of higher government spending, may ultimately serve keep the official GDP number from looking too bad. They’ve rescued it in the face of gloomy PMIs, which also cover the (currently no less gloomy) construction and manufacturing sectors, in the past.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Based on data\u0026nbspin Credit Suisse\u0027s World Wealth Report, the Equality Trust calculates that the richest 1 per cent in the UK owns the same wealth as the bottom 80 per cent, or 53.2 million people.Such comparisons have sometimes been criticised in the past because they define\u0026nbspsome people with debts as having zero or negative wealth, when they may actually be living relatively comfortably. The latest official figures estimate that a household in the middle of the bottom fifth of the population owns £13,854.What is not disputed is that wealth has risen sharply over the past decade as those with assets such as shares and investment property have enjoyed rising prices. Over the same period, rewards for work have not kept up. Average inflation-adjusted wages have still not recovered to their pre-crisis peak in 2007 – the longest wage stagnation in two centuries.Welfare cuts and tax changes since the Conservative-led coalition came to power in 2010 have hurt the poorest the most.By far the worst affected have been the poorest 10 per cent of households with children, who have seen their incomes cut by almost a fifth –\u0026nbsp£3,800 per year, research published last week by the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows. Overall, households in the lowest tenth –\u0026nbspwith or without children – have seen their budgets cut by 7 per cent.\u0026nbspThe highest-income decile also pay 4 per cent more of their income as tax, the IFS found. That group, however, which has more savings, investments and property, is also most likely to have benefited from rising wealth.Inequality has become an important issue in the election, with the Labour Party pointing out that a third of the UK\u0027s billionaires have donated to the Conservatives.The Resolution Foundation warned last week that child poverty will rise to its\u0026nbsphighest since the aftermath of the Second World War under the Conservatives, because the party\u0027s manifesto retains existing benefit cuts.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We can do better!”On his radio show, Dyke further explained to his listeners that he would not be playing the track this festive season. “I hope I’m not going to ruin your Christmas,” he said, “but I’ve decided that I am no longer comfortable with playing ‘Fairytale of New York’ by The Pogues and Kirsty MacColl.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The 50 best albums of the decade – 2010 to 2019 Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth.

Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. “I think Christmas songs should be about excited children, toys, Christmas trees, snowy streets, ski lodges, reindeer, wrapping paper, Santa, family, peace on earth and love,” the DJ added. “I just find The Pogues’ ‘Fairytale of New York’ a nasty, nasty song.”“Fairytale of New York” is a source of annual consternation due to its lyrics, with some radio stations censoring the track to prevent possible offence.The story behind The Pogues’ ‘Fairytale of New York’In 2017, MacGowan defended the track’s use of the word “f*****”, writing in a statement: “The word was used by the character because it fitted with the way she would speak and with her character. She is not supposed to be a nice person, or even a wholesome person. She is a woman of a certain generation at a certain time in history and she is down on her luck and desperate.“Her dialogue is as accurate as I could make it but she is not intended to offend!” he added.“Fairytale of New York” reached number two in the UK Top 40 on its release in 1987, and continues to be one of the UK’s most popular Christmas songs. In 2018, it resurfaced to reach number four in the charts.In a statement, a BBC spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“This was Alex’s decision. There is no ban.

Based on data\u0026nbspin Credit Suisse\u0027s World Wealth Report, the Equality Trust calculates that the richest 1 per cent in the UK owns the same wealth as the bottom 80 per cent, or 53.2 million people.Such comparisons have sometimes been criticised in the past because they define\u0026nbspsome people with debts as having zero or negative wealth, when they may actually be living relatively comfortably. The latest official figures estimate that a household in the middle of the bottom fifth of the population owns £13,854.What is not disputed is that wealth has risen sharply over the past decade as those with assets such as shares and investment property have enjoyed rising prices. Over the same period, rewards for work have not kept up. Average inflation-adjusted wages have still not recovered to their pre-crisis peak in 2007 – the longest wage stagnation in two centuries.Welfare cuts and tax changes since the Conservative-led coalition came to power in 2010 have hurt the poorest the most.By far the worst affected have been the poorest 10 per cent of households with children, who have seen their incomes cut by almost a fifth –\u0026nbsp£3,800 per year, research published last week by the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows. Overall, households in the lowest tenth –\u0026nbspwith or without children – have seen their budgets cut by 7 per cent.\u0026nbspThe highest-income decile also pay 4 per cent more of their income as tax, the IFS found. That group, however, which has more savings, investments and property, is also most likely to have benefited from rising wealth.Inequality has become an important issue in the election, with the Labour Party pointing out that a third of the UK\u0027s billionaires have donated to the Conservatives.The Resolution Foundation warned last week that child poverty will rise to its\u0026nbsphighest since the aftermath of the Second World War under the Conservatives, because the party\u0027s manifesto retains existing benefit cuts.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There was no waiting in the lines obviously – you were with a prince,” she told Panorama.\u0026nbsp“Andrew asked me what I wanted to drink, you know, and I said, ‘Oh, you know, something from the bar’. He had something clear. I know mine was vodka … and then he asked me to dance.“He is the most hideous dancer I’ve ever seen in my life.“I mean it was horrible and this guy was sweating all over me, like his sweat was like it was raining basically everywhere. I was just like ‘ugh’ – grossed out from it, but I knew I had to keep him happy because that’s what Jeffrey and Ghislaine would have expected from me.”When they left the club, Ms Giuffre says Ms Maxwell gave her instructions.“In the car Ghislaine tells me that I have to do for Andrew what I do for Jeffrey, and that just made me sick.”\u0026nbspShe said that later that evening, she had sex with the duke upstairs at Ms Maxwell’s house in Belgravia.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is a story of being trafficked, this is a story of abuse and this is a story of your guys’ royalty.”The Panorama interview was recorded before the Prince spoke to Newsnight but she has since told the BBC she stands by every word she said.In response to the programme, Buckingham Palace referred to a previous statement saying: “It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.”A statement last month said the duke “unequivocally regrets his ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein” and “deeply sympathises with those affected who want some form of closure”.The Prince and the Epstein Scandal\u0026nbspis on BBC One at 9pm.Duke of York\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We\u0027re a country with 150 billionaires, and we\u0027ve still got people sleeping on the streets\u0027Jeremy Corbyn says he will give up the luxury rural retreat of Chequers if he wins the general election, in a protest against rising homelessness.“It can\u0027t be right. We\u0027re a country with 150 billionaires, and we\u0027ve still got people sleeping on the streets,” the Labour leader said, when quizzed on whether he would use the grace-and-favour mansion.But Mr Corbyn got into a tangle after saying he “usually” watches the Queen’s Christmas Day\u0026nbspmessage – then mistakenly claiming it is shown in the morning.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDuring the interview on ITV, he also declined to set out the most romantic thing he has done, saying: “Wow, that\u0027s a hard one. Nobody ever thinks of me as romantic.”And, asked for “the most romantic sort of wild and reckless thing you’ve ever done”, Mr Corbyn replied: “You can\u0027t ask that question on television.”John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has already said he would give up Dorneywood, the country pile offered to chancellors of the exchequer and open it to the public instead.On ITV, Mr Corbyn was asked: “Would you consider giving up Chequers if you were prime minister?”, replying: “I would indeed.”He was also asked: “Do you sit down to watch the Queen\u0027s Speech?”, telling the interviewer, Julie Etchingham: “It\u0027s on the morning, usually we have it on – some of the time.”She replied: “It’s not on in the morning, it’s at three o’clock in the afternoon,” prompting Mr Corbyn to say: “It’s when its repeated, in the afternoon.”Created with Sketch.

Obviously, like everybody else does.“And, I also visit the homeless shelter, either on Christmas Day, or the day before, to talk to, and listen to people\u0027s lives, about how they could be made better with a government that cared for them.”Mr Corbyn was also asked it was embarrassing that he said he would confront Donald Trump at Buckingham Palace, but did not actually manage to speak to him.Still no date for Johnson grilling, says Andrew NeilTrump is lying when he says he’s not interested in the NHSInside Politics: PM dodges photo with US president despite No 10 talksJohnson accused of ‘insulting’ voters over no-deal Brexit danger“Not in the slightest,” he said. “Absolutely not in the slightest.

Of course, that includes President Trump, yes.”Asked how he would form a good relationship with Mr Trump, the Labour leader said he would “work out issues that we agree on”He would then “try and persuade him on both trade issues and particularly on climate change and the importance of the Paris Climate Change\u0026nbspAccord”.“I hope we can go further than Paris because we cannot go on allowing global warming to carry on at this rate.

But, writes Ashley Cowburn, now it’s at a crossroadsA parasitic organisation, a bit of rabble, proof of a Trotskyist infiltration, a theatrical cult. These were just a handful of the phrases used to describe Momentum, the group of activists on the left of the Labour Party, in its early days. They would have likely been far worse had one of the other names put forward been chosen: Swarm.“Look, when you ask people to come up with ideas for names, what they do is they can think of two or three good ones, or reasonable ones, and then try to make up the numbers,” says founder Jon Lansman. “I think Swarm wasn’t even on the bottom rung. That got the biggest laugh.”The grassroots organisation was set up by Lansman, alongside Adam Klug, Emma Rees and James Schneider, in the wake of Jeremy Corbyn’s 2015 leadership success. They had all worked on the Labour leader’s surprise victory, and sought to harness the energy behind that campaign to build a social movement supporting Corbyn’s left-wing policy agenda – drawing inspiration from anti-austerity movements in Europe, including Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFour years later, sitting in Momentum’s Finsbury Park office, serving as an election headquarters close to the Labour leader’s constituency office, Lansman, who is wearing an orange tie-dye Grateful Dead T-shirt, reflects on the name they eventually chose. “It’s very difficult when you’re trying to think of a name\u0026nbsppeople associate the word with what they think the words means, rather than what they think it will become once you create a big organisation which has a big effect. And then the word acquires a completely new meaning which is how people see what Momentum became. Obviously it reflected the momentum that increased during the course of the leadership campaign.”What Momentum became is a group boasting 40,000 members paying a minimum of £3 per month that has put itself at the forefront of Labour’s push to win next week’s general election, raising £500,000 in donations to be used on canvassing by its army of activists and innovative digital campaigning. But that is a far cry from where it all began.\u0026nbspAs Corbyn’s popularity grew in the 2015 leadership contest, those intimately involved in the campaign decided a separate organisation was required to ensure the energy from the tens of thousands of members who joined Labour did not dissipate. Lansman, who had cut his teeth 34 years earlier in Tony Benn’s deputy leadership campaign, crucially\u0026nbsphad also kept the email list of Corbyn supporters.Welcoming its eventual launch, Corbyn said at the time: “We need to put our values, the people’s values, back into politics. To do this, we need to keep up the momentum we have built over the last four months.”\u0026nbspBut today, Lansman admits Momentum launched “before we were ready”, adding: “We didn’t have a constitution, we’d had all these groups spring up around the country organically, we didn’t organise them.\u0026nbspWe didn’t have the rules, we tried to impose – because we launched without a constitution – we tried to impose some rules on them.”“It was a turbulent time,” Lansman adds. “We had people who weren’t members of the party, people who perhaps had paid £3 to vote, but had decided not to join the party. It was a difficult time to establish an organisation, but we did and we have established a new, left organisation, with a culture that is very different from any left organisation.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailMomentum faced considerable conflict with the party’s MPs at Westminster over the highly contentious issue of deselections. Those opposed to the party’s new leadership viewed the organisation as a threatening force, seeking to purge critics of Corbyn from the Labour Party, while activists pointed to increasing internal democracy and enfranchising party members.\u0026nbspThe threshold for MPs to be “triggered” was reduced at last year’s Labour conference, and Lansman says there is still “further to go” in handing party members more powers – pointing to the group’s failure, so far, to introduce “open selections”.\u0026nbspThere’s a tendency with journalists to demonise Momentum. I’ve met Momentum members of all shapes and sizes“It would have been much better to have open selections where people make positive choices for the candidate they thought would best represent them, rather than having to make negative choices about not wanting a particular person, which I think is more isive,” he adds.\u0026nbspCritics included former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, who famously denounced the Trotskyist group Militant at the 1985 party conference. Ahead of the first The World Transformed in 2016 – a festival at Labour conference by Momentum activists – he said the “sectarian ultra-left” speaking at the organisation’s events risked endangering the party as a political force.\u0026nbspHis concern, he added, was that decent and enthusiastic young people were being “manipulated” by “people from the hard left organising in a less-than-transparent way to secure their aged-old objective, the control of the Labour Party”.But, speaking in the dining room of her home in Hackney, east London, Diane Abbott dismisses the criticism of the organisation. “If Neil Kinnock knows more than a dozen Momentum members, I’d be surprised,” the shadow home secretary says. “What he is doing is confusing them with Militant, but they are a different thing.\u0026nbsp“The point about Momentum is that it was people who were either in the party or, crucially, joined the party to support Jeremy Corbyn – that’s who they are. There’s a tendency with journalists to demonise Momentum. I’ve met Momentum members of all shapes and sizes, some of them have never been in the party, some of them are very young, some of them are a bit closer to me in age.”But Lansman acknowledges there have been periods of ision, including the “difference of view on antisemitism” allegations. Shortly after Momentum’s inaugural gathering at the Labour Party conference in 2016, Jackie Walker, who was then the organisation’s vice chair, was stripped of\u0026nbspher position after considerable criticism of her remarks about Holocaust Memorial Day. “In terms of Holocaust day, wouldn’t it be wonderful if Holocaust day was open to all people who experienced Holocaust?” she told a fringe event. Walker was expelled from Labour earlier this year and has made a film, called Witch Hunt, about her experiences.After Corbyn defeated an attempt to oust him as leader in 2016, the organisation was no longer just a Praetorian guard for the Labour leader during periods of instability. Sweeping changes to the organisation were rapidly executed in early 2017, and Momentum announced it would affiliate to the Labour Party itself. It meant its grassroots supporters were required to be, or become members of, the national party. Those who were expelled from Labour could no longer operate within the organisation.It then turned its firepower to mobilising activists in marginal seats across the country, using\u0026nbspinnovative forms of digital campaigning. A developed version of its 2017 snap election app “My Nearest Marginal”, pioneered\u0026nbspby Bernie Sanders’ team during the US democratic primaries, which directed activists to areas where canvassing was required, has been created for the December election.\u0026nbspMomentum’s tactics also won plaudits from unlikely quarters in the aftermath of Theresa May’s failed gamble to win a greater Conservative majority. Giles Kenningham, a former director of communications for the party, commented: “Labour have used Momentum to devastating effect. The Tories do not have an equivalent group pushing out their message”.\u0026nbspIt is still the situation today that the Conservatives have no equivalent. Within days of MPs agreeing to fight a general election, Momentum dwarfed the funds it raised at the last poll. Staffing at Momentum has been increased from 15 to 55 full-time members, funded by almost half a million pounds of donations, and over 1,400 volunteers have pledged to take an average of two weeks out of work to campaign for a Labour government.\u0026nbspThe digital side is coordinated\u0026nbspfrom the north London office space where activists have a paper countdown of “days until socialism” plastered to the wall. The upgraded app – “My Campaign Map” – has had over 1.4 million views and gives advice to Labour campaigners on where they can make the biggest impact. In the week after MPs voted for an early election, the organisation coordinated “Super Saturday” through the app with thousands of activists hitting the streets.One activist, 32-year-old Jessica Adams, a cultural studies student and Momentum member, claims the app had been “really, really helpful” and she had visited constituencies\u0026nbspacross the UK, including Chingford and Woodford Green, Kensington, Battersea and Aberconwy. Adams says “My Campaign Map” has been “really effective”, adding that hundreds turned out in Chingford, where the Labour candidate Faiza Shaheen is attempting to unseat the senior Conservative Iain Duncan Smith and wipe out his slim 2017 majority of just over 2,400.The journalist and Labour activist, Owen Jones, who has spent time across the country during the election campaign, says Momentum has played a “pivotal role in mobilising activists” and has helped get activists knocking on doors in both defensive and offensive constituencies. “Momentum played a huge role in just getting people to knock on doors, listen to people and get the critical information needed to pinpoint who the undecided voters are.”Lansman: ‘We are the new mainstream’In his Westminster office – the day after the Labour leadership signed up to a winter election – John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor and close ally of Corbyn, describes Momentum as “one of the most successful things that’s happened” to the party. “It’s been a real asset to us all the way through – more than Jeremy, it’s an asset for the Labour Party”.McDonnell adds: “It’s just a huge activist organisation, in terms of enthusiastic members – most of them young people. What’s interesting, they are very professional about how they operate, they are young people who come up with really creative ideas about how to mobilise, how to engage with people, and their social media presence is so effective. They have these training sessions with people about how to engage in conversation on the doorstep, how to use the right language, how to ensure you actually listen.”For Momentum, the big question is: what happens next? After finding relevance fighting for Corbyn in two leadership battles, and now, two general elections, the group is keeping one eye on its next step. A major shift came earlier this year, and had a rippling effect at Labour’s annual conference on the Brighton seafront. Momentum began lobbying for policies that went beyond Corbyn’s existing blueprint for a socialist Britain, including a four-day working week, the abolition of immigration detention centres, and a green new deal focused on achieving zero carbon by 2030. “Radical and transformative policy can’t only come from the halls of Westminster,” a spokesperson declared at the time. “It must come from Labour’s half a million members.”\u0026nbspAttempting to reinvigorate activists demoralised by Labour’s triangulation on Brexit, for the first time the group found itself publicly demanding a more radical programme for government than the one on offer. After all, one of its founding values was to support Corbyn’s left-wing policy agenda, not just the leader himself. It could also be viewed as the organisation re-establishing itself for one of two scenarios: a post-Corbyn Labour Party, or a Corbyn government.\u0026nbspFor the latter, it is how to remain relevant having played a major role in installing one of the most left-wing administrations in Downing Street in British political history. It is clear there is no intention of winding down when this ultimate goal has been achieved. Instead, it will be about ensuring there is “demonstrable public support” for key elements in Labour’s “boldest and most ambitious programme since 1945”, such as the green new deal that Lansman believes will come under attack in parliament from the Conservatives and opposition parties. “I don’t have any doubt that Jeremy and John McDonnell are committed to that programme,” he says. “I think that doesn’t mean to say no pressure is required to ensure that the Labour Party as a whole sticks with its guns.”Jones believes that if Labour forms a government after the snap election, “all hell would break lose from an establishment which is not very happy at all with that form of government”.\u0026nbspHe adds that Momentum’s role in this scenario would be to continue mobilising in communities, but also putting pressure on a Labour administration.\u0026nbspHe says: “It shouldn’t just be an auxiliary wing of the Labour leadership. Already you’ve seen Momentum put pressure on the Labour leadership to shifting position on anything from the rights of migrants, which the Labour leadership have been quite depressing on since the referendum, and other issues like being more radical on the climate emergency.“In government, Momentum should put pressure on the Labour leadership if it wasn’t to fulfil radical promises – it’s not there to be a Corbyn fanclub, it’s there to fight for socialist policies.”But as Laura Parker, a former private secretary to the Labour leader and now national coordinator at Momentum, said at the beginning of the campaign: the party has a “mountain to climb” to achieve victory and deprive Johnson of a majority Conservative government. Lansman points to Labour’s recent improvement in the polls – a BMG survey for The Independent showed the party had cut the Conservative lead to just six points at the weekend. He believes a “great number of seats” are within target if Labour’s position improves, but on the prospect of a majority Labour government he admits: “That is obviously a lower chance than us being in some kind of minority government, but I think there’s an excellent chance of that and that is absolutely what we’re working for. That’s why we’re targeting offensively, because we want to win, and we think we can win.”For the former scenario, however, it is how Momentum reasserts itself if Corbyn is defeated at the first December general election for almost a century. According to last week’s polling model by YouGov, which accurately predicted the outcome of the 2017 election, Labour is on course for its worst election result since 1983 when Michael Foot was at the helm of the party. If it is proved correct a second time, Corbyn would be under immense pressure to resign.\u0026nbspMomentum will probably play a key role in the resulting leadership contest, and if it decides to throw its powerful caucus behind a left-wing candidate, that inidual will have a considerable chance of victory. But for now, at least, Lansman is unwilling to entertain life after Corbyn. “We’re focused on winning, we’re not focused on losing, or losing badly,” he says. “I think Jeremy should step down when he wants to step down. I think that is matter to be considered – these are matters to be considered when we, after the election. I don’t expect there actually be a very rapid decision. There will only be one week before Christmas at that point. I’m expecting him to be putting a cabinet together in that week.”But one thing is clear: there will be no closing down of operations at Momentum should Labour lose the election and Corbyn decide it is time to step aside. “The wilderness years are over whatever the outcome of this election,” Lansman adds. It’s a reference to his own return from political irrelevance and the left’s position on the fringes of the Labour movement. “The Labour Party has shifted big time. Actually British politics has shifted against austerity big time. That was achieved actually as soon as Jeremy won. Theresa May was already trying to park her tanks on our lawn, claiming that austerity was over,” he says. “I’m not going back to the wilderness, no, absolutely. I and Momentum are here for the long run.“We are here for the long run, and we will deal with whatever the result of the election is.”\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Big bars, too. Very hard to miss.And while the club wasn’t running hot enough that we were all rushing outside every few minutes gasping for air, the dance floor, full with bodies by am was humid enough that most were sweating. Prince Andrew claimed he couldn’t have been in Tramp the night Virginia Roberts detailed because he’d been in Pizza Express with his daughters at pm. They must have been eating a lot of Margheritas because things at Tramp didnt get started until midnight.From the off, Tramp did not feel like the “home away from home” that it was advertised as. Or not any home that I’ve ever been to at any rate.For starters, it was carpeted, a luxury not normally entrusted to those of us who like to pay a pound for our Jaeger-bombs.I suppose though when you’re spending £ on a GT, you can be trusted not to waste a drop to spillage.Nostalgia runs through the clubs very foundations. The smoking roomis plastered with quotes from celebrities about their time there.“Tramp was the place where we all took girls, because they wanted to go there” read one, from Terry O’Neil.And looking around it would seem that that was very much still the case. There were lots of girls there on Friday night.Had I been a little bit more naive, and had a group of glamorous girls at the table next to us not told me how much they’d charge men to take them home , I might’ve bought into the idea that Tramp was still as it once was an exclusive and exciting place for groupies to congregate, hopeful that their favourite celebrity might buy them a drink I might also have believed Daniel, the “businessman” who split his time between the United Arab Emirates and the UK when he told me that what happened in Tramp was all “harmless fun.”There’s no denying that Tramp is a great night out. It is the place that saw Keith Moon literally swing from the chandeliers , where Tara Palmer-Tomkinson partied the night away in a bikini for her birthday in the s. It reeks of history and of charm there’s something about the building that gives you a wink and an arse slap as you walk in. Rather tellingly, after the Prince Andrew interview aired, a quote was found on the club’s website from Rod Stewart: “just as well it was before camera phones. We’d all be in prison by now, the things we got up to in Tramp.”Quite.Sun Online contacted Tramp for comment but had no reply.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Despite what some of them think, Leave voters aren’t stupid and will see through their attempts to hoodwink them.”Sixteen of the  are Labour MPs seeking re-election, having defied voters in the past three years by voting to block, delay and derail Brexit on numerous occasions.Eight are in very heavy Leave areas where up to  per cent backed Brexit.They include high-profile figures such as the former Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett, ex-minister Chris Bryant and former shadow Cabinet member Mary Creagh.In total,  General Election candidates have signed a pledge drawn up by the campaign group Remain Labour.It states: “Labour is committed to a confirmatory referendum, to give you the final say on Brexit. If elected as your Labour MP, I pledge to campaign to Remain in the EU.”By contrast, all  Tory candidates have promised to vote in favour of Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal.But many Labour hopefuls appear to be going back on their word to deliver the will of the people.Mrs Beckett,  defending her Derby South seat where . per cent voted Leave, had previously insisted she accepted the decision her constituents had made. She declared in May : “We have to make the best of it.”Another, Anna Turley — seeking re-election in Redcar where . per cent voted for Brexit — had said: “I will fight for a Brexit that is fair for Teesside”.Wakefield MP Ms Creagh, who declared before the referendum “ we vote to leave, there’s no going back”, is now of the firm belief there is.Jess Phillips has also signed the Remain Pledge despite assuring Birmingham Yardley voters in : “Sixty-odd per cent of constituents want us to leave. I cannot ignore that.”Labour campaign chiefs will this week launch a last-ditch blitz of “Red Wall” Leave-voting constituencies amid evidence working classes are rallying behind Boris Johnson to save Brexit.They face losing a swathe of seats in the north Midlands and Wales, with the biggest swing to Tories in Leave areas.Labour support in Grimsby, held by the party since , has now collapsed dramatically from  per cent in  to just  per cent.Tony Blair’s former seat of Sedgefield, which has not had a Tory MP since , is on BoJo’s target list.An overwhelming . per cent there voted to Leave and sitting MP Phil Wilson said in : “We respect their decisions and voted accordingly in Parliament in favour of Article .” Yet he has since put his name to the “Remain Pledge”.Ilford North’s Wes Streeting has also changed his stance since he said: “I voted to give the people a choice and I will abide by their decision.” Many Labour candidates who have not signed the pledge have barely tried to hide their derision for Leave voters.Sonya Ward, standing in Mansfield, mocked the . per cent who voted Leave there by claiming they “got it wrong, because they didn’t understand”.Tory chairman James Cleverly said last night: “This is a damning indictment of the very people these candidates want to represent, as well as the .million people who voted to leave in .“Despite pledging to respect the result of the referendum, Labour candidates have turned their backs on Brexit in favour of backing a second referendum and stopping Brexit altogether.”Former Labour leader Ed Miliband, defending the Brexit hotbed of Doncaster North, has not signed the pledge.He has been telling his constituents,   per cent Leave, that he voted for a Brexit deal nine times — but Tories pointed out he voted down Theresa May’s and Boris Johnson’s.His double-dealing exposes the scale of panic in Labour’s northern heartlands.Left-wing activist Owen Jones woke up to the Brexit backlash last week, admitting: “If Labour doesn’t do more to win back Leave voters in the North, Midlands and Wales, then Boris Johnson will win a majority.”One candidate revealed they clocked up  miles knocking on doors in their constituency.The source said: “Walking for six or seven hours a day is taking its toll especially in the cold.“People are picking up injuries and we’ve still got two weeks to go.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And  I understand the desire to let yourself off the leash. But it might be one of the few times you find yourself in the same room as your boss — with a chance to impress or ruin your career.You’ll be well aware we are living in the #MeToo era. And we all know, on occasions, it can go too far and that we shouldn’t all be frightened about exactly what we say and who to say it to.To allay your fears, my advice to you isyou want to dance with a colleague, ask her. If she says no then that’s your answer.Compliments are fine by the way. Us women love them , but think of your sister when giving them out.“You look great in that dress” is something you’d say to your sister, and “you look hot in that dress” isn’t.If you are looking at the month ahead and feeling overwhelmed already, this is really the only advice that you need: Start delegating.Write a list of all the jobs that need to be done and then allocate jobs to everyone over the age of ten.Getting your family to pull their weight is the best way to ensure that everyone has a happy Christmas.I know a lot of people dread the season, partly because they have to spend time with tricky in-laws.You can either not invite them  — why ruin your day   — or invite others too . Or just grin and bear it.Lastly,you are struggling with presents, please allow me to share the rules of our traditional Brady Family Christmas Present Game, played by the  members of our family on Christmas Day.Everyone buys four gts, having set a price limit: We have three at £, one at £.Wrap each one beautully so it’s impossible to distinguish premium from Primark. I once placed a roll of toilet paper with Donald Trump’s face on it in a Chanel gt bag — it was the hotly contended present everyone wanted that year . . . until they opened it.You place all gts on the table then take it in turns to throw a dice. When you get a six you pick anyone present you want . Keep throwing until all gts are distributed.Then throw six rounds with two dice and for every six you get you can pinch a present from anyone’s pile.And when it’s done you keep and open the presents you have won. It keeps us occupied for hours.I LOVED the photos of Kelly Brook in the Bahamas, where she is celebrating turning . What a great advert she is for the idea that le begins at !Kelly is naturally beautul with a big smile – and I think she looks absolutely amazing.“Lord Sugar couldn’t relate to me. That was the fundamental problem.“And I started getting that feeling from about week four.”The problem with interviews like this is that it puts her in danger of sounding a little bit like a sore loser.Oh, and also, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but Lord Sugar doesn’t particularly like any of them at the moment.CONGRATULATIONS to builder Steve Thomson, , and his we Lenka, , who scooped the  £million EuroMillions jackpot.All their neighbours have said it couldn’t happen to a nicer couple. And I love the fact that the first thing they want to do with the money is given each of their three kids their own bedroom. This is a fairly humble ambition when you consider they are now one of the biggest British Lottery winners of all time.I also love the fact that Steve said he won’t stop working as a builder and will finish all his jobs before Christmas.He’s also already spelled out to his children thatthey want something “you’ll have to earn it”.All of which reveal an outlook that will stand him in very good stead indeed. It might just mean that he will be able to enjoy his win.The fact is money does change people. It also changes the way others see you. Most families will expect something and when they don’t get it will be angry. They will say things such as “we only want a car . . . it’s not much money for you, but would mean a lot to us”.They will expect you to share out your good fortune.My advice would be to think carefully about what to do with it before you make any rash decisions – and get a very good financial adviser.The problem with people who win a lot of money is that they often totally abandon all their values and spend, spend, spend. Let’s hope Steve and Lenka hold on to theirs.Yes, sure, I can see the temptation to magically get rid of the weight that inevitably comes when you have been, you know, growing another human being inside your body.But she only had a baby six weeks ago and,she waits a bit, she’ll probably just lose the baby weight naturally.In the meantime, yet another celeb demonstrates – and adds to – the pressure to “snap back” to their pre-pregnancy figure within weeks! Yes, your body is important but so is your mind!Six weeks after birth seems too soon to me.EVENit is true that the new Calornian craze of “butt sunning” gives you “surges of energy”, better sleep and “more creativity flowing through le”, which is what one devotee called Meagan promised on a recent Instagram post, I can’t see it catching on here.Meagan  says she has incorporated “perineum sunning” – which involves presenting the area between the anus and vulva to the sun – in to her “daily rising routine”.But talk about the sun shining out of your ar*e…what on earth must the neighbours think.ULRIKA JONSSON is on a dating app for people over   Good for her.

The reason that the licence hasn’t been granted is because Transport For  London said that the taxi app was not “fit and proper” as a licence holder.I can see the appeal of Uber – but notthe price we are paying is safety.Also, we are lucky enough to live in a country that has the best black cab drivers in the world – who know where they are actually going because they train for up to four years.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some will face genuine hardship because of the loss of earnings.RMT members say theyre striking for passenger safety, but this is just a smokescreenThose who try to use the skeleton service face massive overcrowding, congested s and packed carriages.One woman even fainted yesterday on the . line from Woking to Waterloo yesterday morning because of over-crowding.The current strike is part of a long-running dispute on the railways over union objections to the introduction of driver-only operated trains.Since , there have been regular walkouts, such as the three days of strike action on South Western in January last year, which saw the cancellation of  trains.This time, the RMT claims that it is acting “in defence of passenger safety” over changes in the guards’ job descriptions and the removal of their responsibilities of operating the train doors.But this is just a smokescreen. The genuine, more sinister, motivations for the strike are twofold: first to defend their members’ present conditions, no matter how outdated, inefficient or inappropriate second, to promote Labour’s agenda of nationalisation by discrediting the private operators.It is no coincidence that the RMT’s biggest ever strike began during the final full week of campaigning in the General Election.No sector in the British economy would welcome a Jeremy Corbyn government more the trade unions, which are desperate to win back the influence they held in the s.In turn, Labour is seeking to win over disillusioned rail passengers by promising massive cuts in ticket prices.Just as the RMT strike began today, Corbyn’s party announced that it would reduce regulated fares by  per cent, a move cynically targeted at commuters.The unions barons have a stranglehold on Labour, not least because they effectively bankroll the party. It is no exaggeration to say that Labour is the political wing of the union movement.Out of the total donations of £ million to Labour in , the unions gave £. million.The biggest sum, £ million, came from UNITE, led by Corbyn ally “Red Len” McCluskey, the hard-left Merseysider who once boasted that he had led more strikes than any other union boss in Britain.Last week, it was revealed that UNITE has just handed over a further £ million to Labour’s General Election fund.A further £, came from the Communication Workers Union, which has been threatening disruption in the Royal Mail in the run-up to Christmas.That spirit of confrontation would dramatically worsen under Corbyn.If he became PM, he would make it much easier for the unions to hold strikes.His Government would repeal most of the vital reforms introduced by Margaret Thatcher, such as restraints on picketing, democratic rules on ballots and bans on sympathy walkouts.Corbyn’s manesto states that his party plans “to remove unnecessary restrictions on industrial action”, as part of a drive “to create new rights and freedoms for trade unions.”That is a recipe for permanent industrial crisis and economic meltdown.A Corbyn-led Government will turn the clock back to the s, when the bullying union barons brought the country to a standstill.Last year, just , working days were lost to strike action. In , the total was  million and in , during the Winter of Discontent, a colossal . million working days were lost.For most of the British people, that period was a nightmare. But for Corbyn, McDonnell and their allies in the trade unions, it was a time of glorious advance.Their party and supporters are the very last people who would stand up to the trade unions. On the contrary, they will be cheering on the militants, justying all their industrial vandalism and bullying.And, as the climate of appeasement spreads, the dominance of the unions will tighten.The RMT will be at the forefront of the chaos, not least because its General Secretary Mick Cash – who is on a fat cat package of £,-a-year – shares Corbyn’s hard left outlook.Cash recently praised the Labour leader for “the socialist advances that have been made in the party.”This month’s RMT strike gives a disturbing glimpse into dark future that awaits Britain under Corbyn.Behind all its empty rhetoric about concern for the public, the union’s justication for imposing gridlock is as baseless as it is cruel.Contrary to the RMT’s scare-mongering, driver-only operated trains are safer and have a lower record of assaults. That reality was reinforced by a study in  by the Independent Rail Safety and Standards Board, which gave them a clean bill of health.Moreover, the union cannot pretend that rail staff are badly treated.Most of them enjoy far better conditions, holidays, job security, and pensions than their counterparts outside the public services. Like Corbyn’s Labour, the RMT has lost the plot. For the sake of our country, Mick Cash and his fellow unions barons should not be allowed any more power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s definitely brought us closer together emotionally.“We’re a close couple anyway, but we both have a special bond with Otis as well, which was helped by the way we’ve done it.“It’s my egg, and then they did the egg collection from me and then put it back into my body for  hours before being put into Jasmine’s body, and she became pregnant.“Jasmine said he’s going to be an astronaut, but he can be whatever he wants to be. We’ll always support him in whatever he wants to do.“We’re just happy that it’s worked so well and the information is out there.It involved one partner contributing the egg, known as the biological mother, while the other partner carries the baby and experiences the pregnancy as the birth mother.The clinic has now begun offering women the option to incubate the fertilised egg in one partners uterus, rather than an artical environment, for the first  hours before its transferred to the second partners womb for the remainder of the pregnancy.A spokesman for the London Womens clinic said that this not only allows both partners a practical and emotional stake in the pregnancy, but also provides the embryo with important nutrients and other components in a natural, maternal environment.How does the procedure work The incubation capsule, known as AneVivo, allowed Donna as the egg provider and capsule carrier to take a major role in the whole process before transfer of an embryo to Jasmine for implantation and pregnancy.AneVivo is a devicethat allows the gametes to fertilise and grow inside the womb of the gestational mother.The aim of this procedure is not only to allow fertilisation to take place in the more natural environment provided by the uterus, but also to involve the parents or parent-to-be more closely in the process.The catheter AneVivo, holding the injected gametes, is carefully inserted into the uterine cavity at the correct time of development.After a period of  hours, the device is retrieved, and fertilization is assessed in the laboratory.From there, the embryos are cultured in vitro until they are ready for replacement for implantation in the uterus or for cryostorage.Can it improve success rates Fertility experts say there is no medical evidence that shared motherhood provides a greater chance of success.Dr Jane Stewart, chair of the British Fertility Society, told The Sun Online: “While parents may gain something emotionally or psychologically, there is no medical case for this.“Devices that enable intrauterine culture are ‘red’ on the HFEA add-ons list, meaning there is little to no evidence that they provide a greater chance of success”. “It brings you closer together rather than feeling one has a bond more than the other.”Jasmine, who met Donna online before the pair married in , said the couple were “equal in the whole process.”More than  babies have been born to lesbian couples in Britain but this is the first pregnancy with both parents carrying an unborn child.While shared motherhood can allow the parents to have more of an emotional gain, fertility experts say there is no medical evidence that it provides a greater chance of success.Dr Jane Stewart, chair of the British Fertility Society, told The Sun Online: “While parents may gain something emotionally or psychologically, there is no medical case for this.“Devices that enable intrauterine culture are ‘red’ on the HFEA add-ons list, meaning there is little to no evidence that they provide a greater chance of success”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His charred body parts would be passed around for everyone to taste.His blood, which they saved, would be smeared over their bodies. Once the head was fully cooked, they would scalp it, remove his brain and eat it.Everything not eaten would be saved. Some would be used in weapons, others as religious icons.But during that time The Dutch, who had taken over the archipelago from the United East India Company in , had been showing interest in the colony.Max Lapre, known for his strict leadership of the Dutch government ordered five elite Asmats to be gunned down - devastating and angering the tribe who believed in an eye for an eye.The brutal deaths of the five men left a festering wound in the village and every day the Asmats wanted to seek vengeance on the white man.This was when Michael swam to shore on November  .According to the documentation of the Asmat headhunting ritual, they would first remove Michael’s head, then slit him from the neck down his back. Entrails would be removed.Legs and arms would go into the fire while the group chanted. His charred body parts would be passed around for everyone to taste.His blood, which they saved, would be smeared over their bodies. Once the head was fully cooked, they would scalp it, remove his brain and eat it.Everything not eaten would be saved. Some would be used in weapons, others as religious icons.If theyd killed Michael that was how it would have been done, Hoffman says.The Asmat people have spent centuries hunting down their enemies and removing their heads, sometimes transforming their decapitated skulls into pillows and other times using them as macabre bowls to eat the flesh of their opposing tribes.Asmat did not only hunt for skulls, they also worshipped them.The headhunting practice stopped in the s.The skulls of the deceased were stripped of the brain and the eyes and nasal parts were closed up in order to prevent evil spirits to enter or exit the body.Within the tribe there are no sexual barriers, men had sex with men, they shared wives and practised polygamy. They sometimes drank each other’s urine and covered themselves in human blood during bonding rituals.They believe that when they killed a man and ate him, they take his power and become him. Every person was named after someone deceased, or after a killed enemy.So them killing Michael would be their way of making up for the deaths of their tribe members at the hands of the white Dutch.Another of Hoffmans reasons for believing that Rockefeller was eaten by the tribe was had he drowned he would have been found by search parties as he had two gasoline tanks tied to him, which were never found.He also argues that sharks rarely attack humans, and there has never been a shark attack death in Asmat.Upon his disappearance the Rockefeller family flew to New Guinea and searched for over a week.The President John F.

How do I kill the - feral hogs that run into my yard within - mins while my small kids play The tweet rapidly went viral, with smartmouthed users suggesting myriad ways to oust the pigs, including a tactical nuke.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has been accepted by the party.Mr Corbyn added: “Its a Cold War product. It was set up after the Second World War. The whole thing was a tit for tat between the Warsaw Pact and Nato and it led to a deepening of the Cold War.Prime Minister Johnson said the pacist Labour leader’s ambivalence on NATO was of “great selfishness and folly”.A Labour spokesperson said: We dont comment on staffing matters.Jeremy Corbyn will do whatever is necessary and effective to keep the British people safe. He has consistently made the right calls in the interests of peace and security at home and abroad.In government, Labour will spend at least % of GDP on defence and we will maintain our commitment to NATO, our close relationship with our European partners, and use our influence at the United Nations to support peace and security worldwide."},{"url":null,"title":"tourists us citizens facial recognition entering leaving america","story":"Homeland Security wants to expand existing rules to include American citizens, who were previously exempt from the mandatory checks.In a filing, the department has proposed all travellers - not just foreign nationals or visitors - should complete a facial recognition check before entering or leaving the country, reports CNN.Facial recognition for departing flights has increased in recent years as part of Homeland Security’s drive to catch visitors who overstay their visas.The department, whose responsibility is to protect the border and control immigration, has a deadline of  to roll out facial recognition scanners to the largest  airports in the United States.Facial recognition, which matches an image of a person from a photo with a still image of them in a database, is becoming increasingly common in airports throughout the world as airlines use it for security check-in purposes.The US government has used the tech for around  years, but it has only recently ramped-up biometric boarding at airports.In  President Donald Trump signed an executive order to accelerate a full roll out of airport biometrics for all domestic and international travellers.This move was also supported by the Obama Administration.Once the preserve of sci-fi movies, facial recognition is now a mainstream technology.Basically, its a way of identying or verying who a person by scanning their face with a computer.Its main use is to make sure a person is who they say there are – like Apples Face ID, which uses facial recognition to unlock iPhones.But it can also be used to identy people in crowds.Chinese police are using smart glasses linked up to a database of faces to spot criminals at railway stations, for instance.There are lots of dferent ways facial recognition can work.For example, some Samsung phones use iris scanners to very your identity using your eyes.But the most common method of facial recognition will identy features on your entire face.However, the American Civil Liberties Union said the filing contradicts US Customs and Border Protections previous statement that US citizens would not be subject to such surveillance.ACLU senior policy analyst Jay Stanley said in a statement: Travelers, including U.S. citizens, should not have to submit to invasive biometric scans simply as a condition of exercising their constitutional right to travel.The governments insistence on hurtling forward with a large-scale deployment of this powerful surveillance technology raises profound privacy concerns.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are shamed by extreme levels of inequality, neglect and environmental impoverishment resulting from decades of neoliberalism, in Britain and across the world. We are inspired by growing movements, from Chile to Lebanon and beyond, calling for dignity, accountability and economic justice. People are demanding a future that promises their children decent education, health, jobs and homes, and humane and sustainable solutions to the climate crisis.The letter, which has been published online tonight, also accuses Boris Johnson and the Conservatives of having nothing to offer but the prospect of an ever-more unequal and ided society, and dog-whistle politics.  The band Clean Bandit, actors Rob Delaney and Mark Rylance, and comedian Alexei Sayle are all also backing -year-old Mr Corbyn, who became Leader of the Opposition four years ago. It continues: Between hope and despair, the choice before British voters on  December could not be more stark or more urgent.

Given the dreary weather I have more chance of catching a cold than I have of contracting election fever. I wasn’t always so apathetic. As a bright-eyed, bushy-eyebrowed child I invented my own political party called The Preservatives- But We’re Not Articial- which espoused traditional British values like handing your homework in on time and not dropping litter. I would watch party political broadcasts for fun and remember being blown away by Neil Kinnock’s legendary speech at the Labour conference back in . But then le takes over. You get older and realise that whoever gets in things it all just gets harder. I don’t just feel squeezed, I feel like I’m constantly being punched in the face. I live in the Labour stronghold of Bradford West. Maverick George Galloway briefly became our MP for the Respect Party but he didn’t last long and the seat swung back- hard- to Labour.  The community has largely always been pro-Labour but there has also been a move towards the Tories among those who see themselves as upwardly mobile and conservative with a small ‘c’. People say the Referendum unleashed a tidal wave of racism I have witnessed a man in the supermarket look at a family of Asians and say: “At least after Brexit we won’t see so many of them.” But Brexit itself is not that straightforward for us here. I have been told to go back home in broken English by a man newly arrived from Eastern European. Considering I was born and raised here that really is ironic. The city also voted Leave.

Online dictionaries define scaremongering as spreading of frightening rumours. It is sad to say that the situation at the frontline and the real cost of cancelled operations over this decade is not a rumour and is greater than acknowledged or reported. Over a decade of NHS underfunding, we have all become immune to figures especially when spoken by our politicians. The figure of , cancelled operations last year does little to tell us of the true human cost to patients, staff and the wellbeing of the NHS as a national institution. The process of coming into hospital for an operation starts many weeks and months before that dreaded morning when you are handed a hospital gown and askedyou have an allergy multiple times. Operations are cataclysmic moments within the lives of us all, which ripple and affect us and our loved ones. On any given day there are sons, daughters, friends and loved ones waiting nervously at the end of the phone whilst large teams prepare, anaesthetise, nurse, transfer, clean, position, operate and manage recovery of patients.Cancelled operations are now commonplace.With many hospitals operating close to % bed capacity even in the summer months, up and down the country patients are constantly waiting, lists are often reordered and “prioritised”. So many of us members of staff working in theatres, rushing in to start our working day around am, find we are all ready but with no guarantee of beds i.e. nursing staff to look after patients. We then have no option but to wait whilst stressed out managerial staff desperately work with senior clinicians to “make beds” and failing that try and assess which patients will need to be cancelled and rebooked. As NHS staff we are trained to think of patient first and foremost. The human cost on our patients is heart breaking breaking the news so disheartening.  There are patients with broken wrists waiting to hearthey can be fitted in. Their physical pain and emotional turmoil exacerbated by the fact that their partner is having to take time off work to look after them with their elderly parents travelling miles to pick up and entertain young children. There is the patient with daily nausea and stomach pains who has travelled to the hospital on y round trips at least six times to be finally ready for the operation day. With the most challenging operations and unwell patients needing the greatest number of nursing staff, there is the eternal wait for that elusive intensive care bed. Cancer patients with devastating anxiety and fear of the now and the future, their loved ones having taken days off work to come and be with their mums, dads and partners on this momentous day waiting and then being told they will have to come back another day. The human cost sadly ricochets around the NHS. Nursing and support staff are frequently asked to stay late to finish lists which started late due to “no beds” i.e. no nursing staff. There are only so many days that you finish late on a meagre salary of average £k for a nurse that you decide enough is enough and look for a new job.  There are jobs at the brand new shiny “treatment centre” with your friends telling you that their workload is lighter, with only fitter patients qualying for being treated there.  It has been so demoralising over the last decade seeing the multiplying notices informing you of “leaving dos” for long serving staff. Managers giving up after months and years of being asked to deliver the impossible. The human cost is the feeling over this decade of an obsession with “efficiency savings”, that caring for the nation’s health is not valued, that you are not valued, that the NHS is not valued. Recently, as one of my patients was waking through the haze of anaesthetic drugs he turned to me and said “thank you, you are all angels”. We are not angels. We are trying to do our best in our NHS for our patients, with their voices and concerns at the forefront of our thoughts every single day.

After conducting a long-distance relationship when she ed home, the pair married in . in  and he was romantically linked to Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott. But despite being married three times, Mr Corbyn, by his own admission, is not a romantic. Asked by ITVaposs Julie Etchingham, he replied: “Wow. Thataposs a hard one. Nobody ever thinks of me as romantic.”The interviewer pressed him further saying: “So there is no romance that Jeremy Corbyn could offer to…What is the most romantic sort of wild and reckless thing you’ve ever done ” To which a prudish Mr Corbyn replied: “You canapost ask that question on television.”But Ms Etchingham, who elicited the reply running through a field of wheat when she asked Theresa May what was the naughtiest thing the former PM has ever done, replied: “Yes I can.”Eventually Mr Corbyn gave a rather low keyquite sweet response about Laura.

The Shadow Chancellor said the people of Liverpool, where he was born, had been forced to relive again the trauma of the disaster this week. It came after David Duckenfield, the police chief in charge at the  FA Cup semi-final in Sheffield, walked free after a six-week trial at Preston Crown Court. During a speech in Birmingham, Mr McDonnell said: The memory of a previous Conservative government and how it treated the north, midlands, Wales and Scotland - football fans, and the working class. I remember the Hillsborough tragedy like it was yesterday. I remember the brave campaigners who have fought for justice ever since.I remember how my best friend, Jeremy Corbyn , one of the bravest of politicians, stood up for them, fighting for justice for those denied it.Those killed and then lied about at Hillsborough - including by the Prime Minister in his days as a journalist. People need to remember what the Conservatives have done to us over the decades. He went on to attack the Prime Minister over a column he wrote in , in which he referred to working class people as likely to be drunk, criminal, aimless, feckless and hopeless. McDonnell said the level of inequality in Britain was not reflective of a country with Christian roots.Speaking in Birmingham, the senior Labour figure said: On Tuesday a new Shelter report found , children will be without a home this Christmas.On the same day an analysis by the Equality Trust showed the UKaposs six richest people control as much wealth as the poorest  million. It all went to show just how unequal our society is.

And she wasnapost told off by the Queen.Instead the Queen, after greeting the Donald , turned to Anne to see who was next.

Fans will probably be slightly disappointed to learn what really happened, after social media was filled with messages from people praising Anneaposs reaction to seeing Trump.  One wrote: Princess Anne side-eyeing the Trumps.

He was recovering from a minor bladder operation at the time but he states that the two are not linked. However  he tracks the start of his illness to the period of recovery that took place after the operation. He said: I was a very good builder by trade, I was self employed, had a good customer base and provided for my family. I was coming home early from work every day, until I became bed ridden.  I remember waking up one morning and my whole body was fitting and I had lost all sensations in my body. One day I got up and didnapost know where I was.

I have that document printed to show they discharged me.Everyone experiences bouts of mental health, but these are real physical symptoms that are stopping me from ing.

We didn’t want to leave him, so a teacher who knew him stayed and we sat stroking his legs.”  She added: “I would like to meet his mum one day to reassure her that he didn’t suffer at all.” Sonia, , who runs an events and PR firm, went to the school after receiving a call from her son Iman, , who was not injured in the attack. She said of the scene: “When I first arrived, I heard children crying. One was just shouting, I want my mum’ I want my mum.” Sonia said an off-duty firefighter also tried to save Harley’s le at the scene. Harley’s family released a statement yesterday, saying: “We are so devastated by what has happened. Harley was a good, kind, helpful and lovely boy.  We would like to thank everyone for their kind wishes and concern.” Police were called around .pm on Monday to reports of a Ford Ka ploughing into people outside Debden Park High School on Willingale Road, Loughton. It was claimed the driver had tried to mow down pupils at another nearby school minutes earier. The driver fled the scene, and police launched a manhunt. Last night, it emerged that the suspect was arrested in a nearby pub car park.  Landlord Tom James contacted police after seeing the Ford Ka that officers were searcing outside the Merry Fiddlers in Epping. Mr James said: “At around .pm, I was shutting the blind upstairs and noticed a Ford Ka in the car park. The windows looked steamed up. I imediately phoned . An undercover police car arrived. Then another eight police cars closed in around him to ensure he wasn’t getting away.”  Officers also arrested the man, , from Loughton, on suspicion of attempted murder, causing death by dangerous driving, and failing to stop at the scene of a collision, among other charges. The Mirror has been told that several teachers acted “heroically” after they ran from the Debden Park High School in Loughton, Essex after hearing the terrible crash to try and treat Harley and several friends.

That’s how Prince Andrew was described recently.But now Prince Andrew has a chance to showhe really is the moral man he’d have us believe. Andhe does have, as he told Emily Maitlis in that car-crash interview, “a tendency to be too honourable”, then now’s the time to show it. This morning more than  flights will leave London for New York. Andrew could be on any one of themhe wanted to get over there, sit down with FBI officers investigating his mate Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking, tell his version of the friendship with a convicted paedophile, and clear his name for good. And yet, and yet I bet my mortgage he won’t be doing any of that. Most likely, despite his protestations that he’ll be happy to help the FBI, I’ll bet he will be dragged across the Atlantic kicking his golden feet. For the evidence against the Queen’s favourite son is mounting. Lisa Bloom, lawyer for victims of Epstein, told This Morning yesterday that she has a woman who claims she “vividly remembers” seeing Andrew in the Tramp nightclub with Virginia Roberts – the woman kept as a sex slave by Epstein. This is crucial. For in the Maitlis interview Andrew said he was “convinced that I was never in Tramp’s” with her. He reckoned he’d spent the day playing happy families at Pizza Express with his daughters before ing home with them because Fergie was away. Throughout the disastrous interview he stuck to his line that he had no recollection of meeting Virginia and denied ever having sex with her, saying: “I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened.” Yet in her Panorama interview this week, Virginia told of quite clear memories. As she said with shocking openness: “One thing that I can tell you is you never forget the face of someone who has heaved over you.” It’s impossible for us to know who is lying and who is telling the truth. But to the casual observer one certainly seems far more compelling in their account.

The Royals put on brave faces amid the scandal surrounding Prince Andrew to host President Donald Trump , Boris Johnson, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, Angela Merkel and a number of other world leaders to mark the allianceaposs th anniversary.While most eyes were on the Queen and Trump throughout the evening, Princess Anne earned herself a number of new fans with her reaction to seeing the President and his we Melania. At the start of the evening the Monarch, Charles and Camilla can been seen meeting the President, shaking hands and exchanging small talk. However there is one big name missing from the line up - Anne - who is standing slightly off to the side. The Queen can been seen looking over at her only daughter, with many fans believing sheaposs giving her a look which suggests she should be with the group greeting him. She looks over a number of times and gestures with her hands, but Anne doesnapost move over. In fact, the Princess Royal simply smiles and shrugs. Of course we donapost know exactly what was going through her mind, but social media was filled with messages from people praising Anneaposs reaction to seeing Trump. One wrote: Princess Anne side-eyeing the Trumps. The Queen scolds her for not being in the royal receiving line and she simply shrugs.  Another added: Feeling Princess Anne big time today. Haven’t loved her as much as since she won It’s A Royal Knockout. A third commented: I think Iaposve fallen in love with Princess Anne.Later in the evening Anne was seen having a cosy chat with Macron, Boris Johnson , Canadian PM Justin Trudeau and Dutch leader Mark Rutte - and they seemed to be having a joke at Trumpaposs expense.Clearly unaware that they are being filmed, Johnson turns to his French counterpart and asks: Is that why you were late  “He was late because he takes a -minute press conference at the top,” Trudeau answers for him.  After Macron, who has his back to the camera, says something beyond the microphoneaposs reach, the Canadian PM adds: You just watch his teamaposs jaws drop to the floor. Johnson does not offer anything further to the conversation but smiles throughout. Anne also appears to be involved in the chat but itaposs unclear what she says orshe responds. Although they do not mention him by name, they are clearly speaking about Trump. Trudeau appears to be referring to Trumpaposs talkative demeanour during the first day of the two day NATO summit.  The US President spent two hours talking to reporters on a day otherwise packed with strategic meetings - a feat that appears to astonish the Canadian leader. Macron can be seen speaking animatedly in the exchange, clearly not having run out of energy since his -minute long appearance alongside Trump. During the tense encounter the French President challenged the Republican leaderaposs vision for NATO and approach to the Turkish conflict. It is not clear how the American President would reacthe found out his fellow world leaders were having a chuckle at his expense. When he announced the US would be withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, Trump said: “We don’t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us any more. And they won’t be. They won’t be.”  The mocking ban clearly hadnapost kicked in by the following yearaposs United Nations General Assembly when Trump said he had accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country.” He claimed that the subsequent laughter from his world leader colleagues was not directed at him but with him. The Royals have been in a state of crisis for the last few weeks after the Queenaposs son Andrew gave an interview about his relationship with disgraced US financier Jeffrey Epstein.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe likes of John Lewis and MS may grab the headlines when it comes to tear-jerking Christmas adverts. However, a DIY store from a small town in Mid-Wales is giving the retail giants a run for its money with an advert that has been hailed the best of the festive season - and cost just £. The adorable two-minute clip from Hafod Hardware in Rhayader, Powys, Wales, took just one day to film and features two-year-old Arthur Jones. Arthuraposs proud dad Tom Jones, whose family owns the independent shop, and film-maker friend Josh Holdaway incredibly filmed and edited the video for less than £. The heart-melting clip has already won over the hearts of customers in the small town and has also grabbed a nationwide audience since being uploaded online. The video begins with little Arthur getting out of bed before donning his apron and carrying out a dayaposs aposworkapos at the family-run hardware store. Sweeping the floors, polishing the counter and replacing stocks on the shelves are all part of his duties as the busy boy is also on hand to deal with customers - all with a friendly smile and big thumbs up.  The commercial - which features four generations of Tomaposs family - has a special twist at the end withArthur shutting up shop before carrying home a Christmas tree. It features a cover of Alphavilleaposs  hit aposForever Youngapos, performed by American singer-songwriter Andrea von Kampen. It is the third year in a row that Hafod Hardware, which opened in  and is one of the oldest businesses in the town, have released a Christmas advert.  The previous commercials have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times to huge acclaim and Tom is again hoping to once again put a smile on peopleaposs faces. Tom, , said: The aim is to make it the best Christmas advert of the year. The comments weaposve had so far have been amazing.  Making this video with my son has been an experience I will cherish for a letime. They say never work with animals or children but he was a joy. Heaposs such a bright boy and I would be lyingI said it was dficult to get him to perform on screen.  He often comes to visit me in the shop, so werenapost really asking him to do anything he hadnapost done before. Whenever I watch the advert, it makes me well up with pride. Forever Young was the song I really wanted. I asked Andreashe could do a cover and she was happy to do it. She recorded it in a studio and paid  for a sound engineer. I said weaposd pay - so thataposs all the advert has cost us. Sheaposs got an incredible voice, itaposs perfect for the advert. All three adverts touch upon the signicance of family at Christmas and so it was extremely important to me that Arthur had a role in each one.  Showing the transition of him as a young baby in the first advert, through to the young man he is today, really does capture the essence of what we have been trying to create. We are told every year that Christmas is for kids, but thereaposs nothing stopping us all from being big kids at Christmas. All the time, people are coming into the shop and asking us about our Christmas adverts. Even strangers pop in to say theyaposve seen them. People are always asking whether we were doing another one this year. Itaposs hard to say no, we feel obliged to do it.  The locals love them. Itaposs nice to think we can put a lot of smiles on peopleaposs faces in the community. Itaposs always nice to do something for the town. People always compare our videos to the likes of John Lewis and we try to get the same message across as the mutli-million pound adverts do. But there is an underlying message. We are just a small independent shop in Mid Wales trying to compete with the big boys like John Lewis and MS.

Guests at the Sir Richard Owen in the centre of Lancaster complained of the vile symptoms over the last week. Now Lancashire Live reports the pub is shut so it can be fully sanitised. A notice has been put up in the window of the venue advising that the closure will remain in place aposuntil further noticeapos. Laurence Johnson, , visited the establishment over the weekend. The man, of Lancaster, said: So I went to aposspoons with two other mates on Sunday evening, we had a couple of drinks and a bit of food. Monday evening I threw up twice and had diarrhoea. One of the lads I went with has since been throwing up. Two other mates had been spoons over the weekend and were complaining of being very ill too. I seem to have recovered a bit faster than my other mates but Iaposm still a bit off.Someone has told me that it is to do with the water system so would seem ironic that they have closed since the weekend for work to be done. A spokesman for the pub giant confirmed the closure. Norovirus is a stomach bug that causes vomiting and diarrhoea, with other possible symptoms including nausea, fever, a headache, and aching arms and legs, the NHS says. Also known as the winter vomiting bug, it can be very unpleasant, but it usually goes away in about two days. The symptoms usually start within one to two days of being infected. It can be spread very easily from close contact with someone with norovirus, touching infected surfaces or objects and then touching your mouth, or eating food that has been prepared or handled by someone with the illness. The best way to stop it from spreading is washing your hands frequently with soap and water. Alcohol hand gels do not kill norovirus. He said the virus spread after a staff member fell ill. It is hoped to reopen on Friday after a full refurbishment. But Lancaster City Council, which has no overall political control, said it had no involvement in the closure. The council isnapost involved in investigating any concerns raised regarding the Sir Richard Owen public house in Lancaster, a spokesman for the council.

She will contradict his claim that he was at home with his daughters after a trip to a Pizza Express on the night he is alleged to have had sex with the -year-old. Lisa Bloom, representing some victims of paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, said she will take the unnamed woman to the FBI. The US lawyer was in London yesterday hoping to talk to Andrew about his friendship with the billionaire financier, who killed himself in jail aged  in August. Virginia, now  with the surname Giuffre, claims she was forced by Epstein to have sex with Andrew at the London home of pal Ghislaine Maxwell in March  after dancing with the prince at Tramp nightclub. In last month’s BBC Newsnight interview Andrew, , denied they had sex and said he was not at the club that night. He has vehemently denied all Ms Giuffre’s claims against him. But Ms Bloom said: “I’m representing a witness who says she was there. She saw Prince Andrew with Virginia, remembers it vividly because she was told this is a member of the Royal Family.  “It was a very big thing for her. She saw Virginia there with him. I’m going to take her to the FBI.” In a direct message to Andrew she said on ITV’s This Morning: “You’ve said you’re going to cooperate, let’s do it. Don’t make us subpoena you. Don’t make law enforcement chase you. Come to the US, sit down with the FBI and attorneys and answer questions. Give us the documents, calendars, journals... and have staff who travel with you answer questions as well.” It came as Virginia’s dad Sky Roberts said he had “no doubt” she is telling the truth about Andrew.

Veronica Hilda Theriault, from Western Australia, pleaded guilty to deception and dishonesty charges over her fabricated curriculum vitae that secured her a top position in the Department of Premier and Cabinetin . The -year-old had worked in the position for just over one month and had pocketed £,of her annual salary of , before she was found out. For one count of deception, Theriault gave the government officials employing her the name of a woman from a previous position who would act as a referee. The referee gave the DPC “glowing feedback” about Theriault’s performance, but it was actually the accused who was impersonating her. The prosecution said there was an element of planning in Theriault’s offending. Judge Boylan from Adelaide Supreme Court said: “You fraudulently obtained employment for which you were paid a large salary and in the course of which you may have had access to sensitive material.” The defence counsel described Theriault’s actions as not particularly sophisticated and said it involved a unique set of circumstances. Theriault was suffering from bipolar at the time and a deterioration in her mental condition first made officials suspicious. During sentencing, Justice Boylan said Theriault applied for the DPC role and included in her application a CV that showcased a fabricated education and work history.  He added: ”That CV led to you being interviewed for the job — you supplied that document to the Department of Premier and Cabinet and [it] is the basis for dishonestly dealing with documents. You arranged that your brother would supply a reference to the department in which he said he worked for you when you were employed at Wot. A LinkedIn profile under her name said she worked as chief geek for accommodation booking company Wot in Melbourne from  to August this year, but the company said Theriault had never worked there, ABC reports. Her brother had also never worked there.

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"harry potter halloween at pony club","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHarry Potter was the theme for this year’s Hallowe’en Fun Day organised by Argyll South Pony Club at the Long Walk arena near Kilmartin.Even the judges # Ulla Riddell and Mary Lou Aitchison – got into the spirit of the day by dressing as Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed. At first I thought it was a dog on the road until my headlights picked him up.Tom Cullen, Dunskeig, Ardfern.We would like to invite readers to nominate a deserving carer for a chance of going on a free holiday, while the person they care for comes on a free break with us, Revitalise, through our new Grace Award for Caring.Carers save the economy £ billion per year, which is more than the NHS budget.

In keeping these candles burning for extended periods, the inidual prayer is believed to be prolonged and amplied along with the intentions of other believers’ prayers.In doing this, a collective

The success of this flight was the impetus for pioneer flights from London to Australia and Cape Town and it is the former that is my subject.In May  the Australian government offered a prize of poundA, for the first Australians in a British aircraft to fly from Great Britain to Australia. In November  six entries started the race. Only two of these reached their final destination the other four crashed in Surbiton, Corfu, Crete and Bali .Of the two flights that succeeded, the clear winners were Ross and Keith Smith they piloted a Vickers Vimy aeroplane and were joined by two mechanics, Wally Shiers and Jim Bennett. Their flight left Hounslow on November ,  and after  days and , miles they arrived at Darwin on December  stops included Lyon, Rome, Cairo, Damascus, Basra, Karachi, Delhi, Calcutta, Rangoon, Singora, Singapore, Batavia and Surabaya. This compares with just under four weeks that it took my grandparents to sail to Perth when they emigrated from Edinburgh to seek a new le in Australia in  with help from the Assisted Passage Scheme.Pilot Ross Smith had flown for T E Lawrence during the First World War and in  he flew the first pioneering flight from Cairo to Calcutta which must have helped the record breaking journey the following year. The Smith brothers received knighthoods and the four members of the crew shared the prize of poundA,. The runners up, who left London on January ,  took  days to reach Darwin, arriving in August . These two flights compare with the recent ldquoworldrsquos longest flight -  hour non-stop from New York to Sydney.The two Smith brothers received a congratulatory telegram from the headmaster of small Scottish school,ldquoWell done Ross and Keith Warriston proud of you Mr F W Gardner headmaster.F Gardner was the headmaster of Warriston School in Moffat where the Smith brothers ndash and their sibling Colin ndash had spent the final two years of their education.Ross and Keith Smith both had the middle name of their mother ldquoMacpherson she was the daughter of an immigrant family from Scotland. Their father had been born in Moffat and emigrated to Western Australia, and in sending their three sons to Moffat to complete their education they were clearly strengthening their bonds with ldquothe old country.The Smith brothers were therefore grounded in Scotland.A well-known fact in the world of cricket is that the famous Australian all-rounder Keith Millerwas named after the two Smith brothers his parents named him Keith Ross Miller.

Thatrsquos because therersquos been a lack of strategic vision. You cannot expect public transport, such as buses, to pay for itself,itrsquos going to be a consistent service.ldquoIn Glasgow, we realised that keeping buses on during the night was vital because although they wouldnrsquot be used often, when people did use them it would be urgent.ldquoNow, Scottish Borders Council, in my view, does not adequately fund public transport.\"They say, and I think theyrsquore absolutely right, that theyrsquore inadequately funded by the Scottish Government.ldquoThe Scottish Government say: lsquoit was a bad boy who done it and he ran away because Westminster didnrsquot give us enough moneyrsquo. Now, thatrsquos an example of where there needs to be a degree of strategic thinking.ldquoOn the question of the train being driven by oil, that, as I understand it, was because it was going to be far too expensive to electry it.ldquoThey could only get diesel-driven stock, so it was that or nothing. Now thatrsquos not acceptable. Itrsquos also not acceptable, in my view, that the rails the Borders line runs on were actually made in China.ldquoThat didnrsquot create pollution here in Scotland, but it did across the world and the jobs werenrsquot created here they were created in China.Conservative candidate John Lamont said: ldquoSome parts of the Borders are very well connected but a lot are not,you speak to residents in Newcastleton or Paxton, they do not have a regular bus service to allow them to get around, so itrsquos wrong to say that buses and public transport are accessible.ldquoWersquore very lucky to have Borders Buses here, I have their exceptionally good app, I donrsquot knowmany of you use it but itrsquos a very simple way to get around and very easily find out where your bus is.ldquoI do use it, because itrsquos a good way to get around and itrsquos better for the environment.ldquoBut you canrsquot say that just because I can use it to get from Berwick Station to my house in Coldstream, that other people have access to public transport services, you canrsquot, because thatrsquos simply not true.On buses, Liberal Democrat candidate Jenny Marr said: ldquoBorders Buses is great, and the routes that have started this week with space for the bikes I think as really important.ldquoTo follow on from what John was saying, at Eyemouth College, they have a high rate of dropout In January and February because of how few buses there are and how dficult it is in the winter.ldquoI think we need to look at the successes in some parts of the region and then try and apply that to other places.ldquoI think with Newcastleton, one of the guys from the Campaign for Borders Rail was telling me thata kid wants to get out of the village on a Saturday they will struggle to get back after one or two in the afternoon, and I think we need to make sure that our public transport infrastructure is not a barrier to progress and not a barrier to children and younger people having the le they deserve to have.Finally, SNP candidate Calum Kerr added: ldquoIn relation to the points made on the railway, obviously there is a move around electrication and talk about hydrogen as well, the Scottish Government has set the target that the railways will be net-zero by , as it stands today.ldquoIn terms of public transport and buses, certainly when I met with bus companies previously, therersquos only two bus routes in the Borders which makes a profit, the X and the X.ldquoPeople just donrsquot use it, so it becomes self perpetuating, because then routes get cut, so people have to use their cars, soa green new deal means fundamentally resetting aspects of the economy, and included in that needs to be transport, then you have to invest:you build it they will come.ldquoYou canrsquot just hope people will start using it, and then yoursquoll find a way to make the routes work, it does require signicant investment.ldquoThere is a pound.m green bus fund, so itrsquos about adding green buses continually.

damp and mould can be found in several rooms.Mr Mclean told us: \"I first noticed water leaking off the roof and an outside pipe and coming into the walls.\"The water had to be coming into the walls, but the workmen didnt think there was anything wrong.\"They did repairs to my taps inside but they wouldnt believe me that there was a problem with water getting into the walls.\"After the new bathroom was fitted the dampness smell became more noticeable, and within a few weeks my wallpaper began falling off.\"After I lost my we two years ago I took a real pride in my flat and decorated every room.\"I had the place beautul, but look at it now.\"Theres mould growing through the carpets, mould on the walls, the wallpaper has come off - how is someone meant to live in a house like this \"Electrical testing on the property also showed that several sockets were dangerous due to the encroaching dampness.And Mr Mclean has also developed a bad cough over the past few months.But the biggest blow for him has been SBHAs decision to increase his rent and also send out a warning letter.He added: \"While this was going on I went to a meeting with SBHA and they announced my rent would be going up from pound to almost pound per week - who would pay pound a week to live like this \"I just received another letter from them to sayI dont pay pound rent arrears as well they will take court action.\"My home has been ruined by them not repairing a leak and this how they treat me.\"Scottish Borders Housing Association deny that dampness issues were reported by Mr Mclean before October.But they admit they were called to his Talisman Avenue flat last December, and also carried out repairs to taps earlier in the year.A spokeswoman told us: \"In December  an inspection was carried out by SBHA with no further action at that time.\"Repairs relating to an immersion heater and also taps had been carried out in the property earlier in  and dampness issues were not raised on these occasions.\"The tenant contacted us on October  and a job line was raised including a specialist survey commissioned to investigate the cause of the problem, prior to instruction of appropriate works.\"Remedial works are currently on site following investigations regarding water ingress.\"The Selkirk-based housing association has also defended its planned rent increases.The spokeswoman added: \"In November , we carried out a consultation on the proposed rent levels for the following year, giving all , tenants the opportunity to provide feedback, via a wide iety of consultation methods, including paper survey, community roadshows and telephone surveys.\"We advise tenants of these opportunities via their autumn newsletter, website and Facebook.

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star. Kick off is pm, with Kintyre Park the expected venue.The Pupils’ Liam Renton on the ball with Ryan Gilchrist looking on at Saturday#s match in Paisley.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

Both these gestures and activities will be incorporated in the workshop and the children will be encouraged to continue them at home to build on positive behavioural changes as a result of attending the Fostering Compassion activities.ldquoThe idea of the Animal Heroes workshop came to me almost four years ago around the time Meghanrsquos and my paths first crossed and she put me in touch with her father. After her devastating accident, I was determined the workshop would come to fruition, but would be done as a tribute to her.ldquoWe are greatly honoured to have her familyrsquos blessing to do this and thank them very much for their unwavering support.Fostering Compassion runs animal and nature-themed workshops for children in foster care and kinship care.

Hersquod not always been homeless, of course, but people rarely see the person behind the label.The one good thing about winter for him was the approach of Christmas. Peoplersquos consciences seemed to be more sensitive at Christmas time.He was an alcoholic and he blamed himself every day for what he was. But this just fed his sense of worthlessness and kept the cycle going. His earlier le, the lsquonormal onersquo with his we and children, was now a long time ago, but when he slumbered he often re-entered it in his dreams.Especially that last family Christmas, when they were all together. He would re-run that time in his mind, just like his we would watch The Devil Wears Prada over and over and never tire of it. Yes, when he closed his eyes it could seem he was there again.But when he came to his senses, he came back to himself: an unloved man, old before his time, who people ignored and passed in the street without looking at. He usually felt completely invisible. To be fair, some people did stop and talk, usually the same ones.Perhaps they never truly understood just how valued those moments were.He understood it, after all he despised himself, so how could he expect others to feel dferently.Alcohol seemed to be his one real friend, the only one to understand and ease his pain.But St Andrewrsquos Day was approaching and this was his cue to get completely sober.He would feel that tingle inside that people call lsquofeeling Christmassyrsquo. It was a painful, bittersweet emotion for John, and his friend alcohol always offered to help. But he would close his eyes and be strong.It was the one thing in his le where he felt he had not let people down.So he would summon all his strength and draw on who he used to be for those last vestiges of self-belief and refuse the offer of help from his destructive friend.He made it and arrived at the door of the managerrsquos office, clean, sober and ready to work.The manager had no idea John was the same man he passed on a daily basis on the street outside.Admittedly, he did look dferent now, butthe manager had ever paused to look at John or speak to him, then he would surely recognise him. But for once he was glad of his invisibility. If the manager had ever recognised him outside then John would probably lose his job.ldquoYour costume is in the back room. You start in  minutes, said the manager.ldquoThe paperwork came through last week so yoursquore set to go.John knew the routine and got changed.When he sat in his chair, he was transformed. He was Santa.For the next five weeks, he knew he was going to be noticed and even loved. People would speak to him in a kind and almost reverent way, ask him how he was. His beard and red suit wiped away his sense of worthlessness.All that day, families came and he spoke to more people in that one day being Santa than he did the rest of the year being himself.Afterwards, he headed back to the hostel with money in his pocket.His old friend whispered in his ear: ldquoSpend it on me, spend it on me.ldquoMaybe later, but not now, John replied in his head.But the hostel was full and he couldnrsquot find any other place.And so he knew hersquod have to spend a bitter night on the streets.The food van would arrive soon, so he decided to wait for it in the busy centre.As he sat, a young girl came up to him.She just stood and stared. John recognised her.She had been one of the children in his grotto earlier and suddenly a fear gripped him: she might recognise who he really was.ldquoCome away from there, shouted her mother.But the girl still stood, staring at John. Then she smiled. John smiled back.Her father came up and took her by the hand, pulling her away without looking at John.He recognised the father as well.He had been so nice and friendly in the grotto, while his daughter stood with him for a photo.But without his white beard and red suit, John was invisible again.ldquoSpend it on me, spend on me, whispered his old friend again, as John had flashbacks of Afghanistan.ldquoSpend it on me and I will keep you company, nobody  cares, pleaded his friend.Then the girl was in front of him again, smiling.ldquoThis is for you, Merry Christmas when it comes.Her father stood by her, holding her hand, but still not looking at John.It was chocolate. The same chocolate bar shersquod chosen with glee in the grotto.ldquoThank you, said John and the girl left with her dad.Johnrsquos old friend was now silent.

Please, I have siller. Mak it look natural. Then me an ma husband can get oan wi oor lives thegither.The witch thought for a moment, then nodded her head.ldquoVery weel, I will help ye, but ye maun dae whit I say.The we smiled with relief: ldquoThank ye.The old woman went ben the hoose to where she kept her herbs and ingredients. The young woman was curious and tried to sneak a look but the witch told her to stay by the fireside until she was finished.Then she came through holding a small bottle of potion.ldquoHere, she said to the we. ldquoThis will dae the trick. Ye maun put ane sma drap o this potion in yer mither-in-lawrsquos tea every day.ldquoBut she maks her ain tea, said the young woman, ldquoshe ay complains I cannae mak tea the proper way.ldquoWeel, ye maun find a way fir her tae allow ye tae mak her tea, said the witch. ldquoThen every day sit wi her as she drinks the tea.

Soon her problems would be over, she thought to herself.The witch watched her go, then closed the door. She had a knowing grin on her face.Two months later there was a desperate knocking on the old womanrsquos door. She looked out of the window and saw the young we standing just outwith the cottage, in a terrible state.So she opened her door.ldquoPlease, please help me, begged the young woman.The witch took her inside. The young woman had run all the way and her shawl had become wrapped round her hair, and her dress was dishevelled with the wind.ldquoOch hen, ye are in a richt fankle, sort yersel oot and sit by the fire fir a warm.The young we rearranged her clothes and started to greet as she spoke.ldquoHae ye got an antidote fir the potion please say ye huv, she said.ldquoAn antidote, hen ldquoAye, Irsquove changed ma mind. I gied ma mither-in-law a cup of tea wi the last drap o potion. I watched her drink and then she telt me that I mak a braw cup of tea and that she wis glad her son hud marrit me! It wis in that moment I realised I didnae want her deid!ldquoI see, said the witch. ldquoIrsquom afraid there is nae antidote fir the potion.The young women cradled her head in her hands. ldquoWhit huv I done, what huv I done, she cried to herself.ldquoYe huv got tae ken her, thatrsquos whit yersquove done, said the witch. ldquoAs ye spent time wi her making sure she drank her tea, ye will have talked, am I richt ldquoAye, sobbed the we, ldquoand she listened tae. I ken shersquos an auld witch sometime, er nae offence, but I understand her better noo.The witch smiled. ldquoGuid, she said, ldquonoo ye can gang hame and keep oan huvin the tea thegither, without the potion.ldquoBut shersquos goanie be deid in a few days, sobbed the we.ldquoNaw she isnae, replied the witch, ldquothe potion wis just a few herbs that wouldnae hairm even a wee beastie.ldquoWhat  Ye telt me that it would kill her! protested the we.ldquoNo I didnae, I said it would work ater twa months. And it has. It wis the hatred ye hud that needed kilt, no yer mither-in-law. And the same goes fir her.The young we was so relieved. For a moment she wondered about asking for her money back, but she realised the potion had indeed done its job.Her relationship with her mother-in-law was not always easy, but they had regular cups of tea and chats together, and often they would laugh as they shared memories and stories from le.ldquoThe claes are in a richt bumfle, said the mother-in-law the following day, then she smiled. ldquoBut letrsquos hae oor tea first and we can sort the claes thegither.The we thought to herself that the witch was indeed a wise woman."},{"url":null,"title":"weekends-christmas-lights-switch-ons-east-lothian","story":"Tomorrow , those in Elphinstone can head along to the switch-on at pm.Hot chocolate and mince pies will be served, with people invited to the minersrsquo club afterwards.On Saturday it is North Berwickrsquos turn, with carol singing from pm outside Abbey Church marking the start of the countdown.The light switch-on takes place at .pm, just before Santa arrives, and children have a chance to meet the special guest.

The bar has stood on that corner since  and was historically known as The Corona until .

They currently operate a popular city centre live music venue and have both managed and operated venues in and around the Southside most of their working lives.When asked about their newest venture the owners said: ldquoThis is such an iconic building and an integral part of Shawlandsrsquo history so when it came to choosing a name, it could ever only be The Corona. We added Bar  Kitchen because this is not going to be the old Corona pub of the rsquos. itrsquos a place for families and friends to meet, celebrate and relax, a real reflection of Shawlands today. In terms of looking back, the name is merely a nod to the distant past, it wouldnrsquot feel right branding this building with any other name when locally itrsquos still fondly referred to as The Corona.With the bar having big plans for the future with new menus, entertainment and family events, come along to this vibrant, buzzing bar and see for yourself.The Corona Bar  Kitchen Pollokshaws Road, Glasgow, G YFwww.facebook CoronaBarAndKitchen----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Glasgow Music City ToursGlasgows music scene is world famous and, since , Glasgow Music City Tours have helped people explore it with their guided walks.By visiting existing venues and disturbing the ghosts of former performance spaces, the tours tell the story of the artists who have stayed, played and made music in Glasgow, the UKs first UNESCO City of Music.The tours are led by enthusiastic musicians, fans and writers who encourage guests to share their stories of memorable gigs.As well as private tours, Glasgow Music City Tours run three scheduled tours every Saturday from Easter until the end of the season.The Merchant City Music - Past and Present tour tells the tale of the areas major music venues from Barrowland Ballroom to Britannia Panopticon via the City Halls, Old Fruitmarket, Mono and the th Note.Starting at Glasgow Royal Concert Hall and ending at King Tuts, the Music Mile tour takes in the sights and sounds of the city centre.

Not just for glaciers that have lakes in front of them, but also those that donrsquot have lakes leave behind signs of how big they used to be and these landforms are a record of where the glacier was in colder times.ldquoNow you can see glaciers have thinned by up to a  metres.Measuring the changes in the Himalayas, which has many of the worldrsquos highest mountains, was no easy feat because of the sheer scale of the landscape.Mr King added: ldquoBecause the mountains are so steep and big, the weathering rates are really high, so therersquos a lot of rock and avalanche debris that works its way down the glaciers. Once that debris gets thick enough, it can act as a bit of a blanket on the glacier it falls on that can protect the ice underneath, so the front generally doesnrsquot recede as much.The change the team documented is the height change in the glacier rather than the change in .Mr Bolch said: ldquoOur results have important implications for future projections of ice loss from the region because the interaction of glaciers and glacial lakes has not previously been considered in future glacier ice loss estimates."},{"url":null,"title":"cash-reserves-report-reveals-28m-benefit-scotlands-nature-spots","story":"Nature reserves are home to important natural habitats and species and give visitors the chance to experience the best of nature in Scotland.However, a new study has found that as well as these recognisable benefits, their worth to the public goes way beyond this.Scottish Natural Heritagehas measured the value of natural capital across its reserves, with the report - the first of its kind in Scotland - revealing that they are worth an estimated pound million to the public each year.The National Nature Reservescapital is made up of numerous climate, tourism, recreation, and health benefits which are present across the ,ha of land owned and managed by SNH.Francesca Osowska, chief executive of the heritage body, claimed the study shows the many advantages of nature as an asset.She said: ldquoThis innovative report vividly illustrates that our nature reserves are providing an outstandingon investment of time, money and resources.ldquoNature is an asset, but one we need to protect and invest in. Key to this is tackling climate change impacts ndash and nature is a solution.ldquoWe need a rich iety of le to be able to sustain food supplies, water and the air we breathe. But itrsquos not just about conservation - enhancing our nature is also part of the solution to the climate emergency.ldquoOur nature reserves are critical to our work of ensuring a nature-rich future for Scotland.Natural capital is the stock of Scotlandrsquos plants, wildle, air, water, and land providing benefits to the people and businesses across the country.SNH claims that assessing the monetary value of natural capital is one way to show how nature provides many benefits to everyone in their everyday lives.Using the natural capital approach to understand naturersquos wider benefits can in turn help businesses and other organisations to make more informed decisions based on a broader picture which includes important environmental factors.The reportrsquos calculations include volunteers contributing , days of work worth a total of pound, SNH land sequestering carbon, mainly through its woodland and saltmarsh habitats, worth poundm and air quality filtration benefits amounting to pound,.Other benefits valued in the report include food, education, renewable energy production, and health and well-being.Annual management costs were estimated at pound.million, which means the estimated benefits of SNH land outweigh the costs by eight to one.The true capital benefits may be much higher, however, as it is not currently possible to measure the other advantages of nature reserves, such as water quality, mental health benefits and flood risk mitigation.The report was welcomed by Dr Deborah Long, chief officer for Scottish Environment LINK, who said the study helped to demonstrate the value of the countryrsquos nature reserves.She said: ldquoScotlandrsquos National Nature Reservesare the jewels in Scotlandrsquos crown as a nature rich nation.ldquoThis new report recognises the monetary value of NNRs and very clearly shows why investment in nature is absolutely crucial in the fight against climate change and the ongoing nature declines, shown in the recent State of Nature Scotland report, and which are happening in Scotland as well as the rest of the world.ldquoIn fact, NNRs are the very best places for nature ndash we all need to be ensuring nature continues to do well in NNRs and the investment not just in managing these reserves but in monitoring how nature is doing is vital.ldquoWith the calculated value of pound million a year, plus the uncalculated value of nature in NNRs for human physical and mental health, as well as ecosystem services like flood protection and clean water, we can very clearly see why investment in nature is fundamental to people and nature and for future generations.SNH is the first public body to publish natural capital accounts for their land in Scotland.It is hoped it may provide a template for other public bodies to follow in considering this approach.Read the full report at https:bit.ly MFWe.To find out more about Scotlandrsquos NNRs, see www.nnr.scot."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  More female leaders offers hope of safer  stronger world","story":"Within a decade of that declaration,   set the wheels spinning on what promises to become a century or more of exceptional chaos and carnage in the middle east, and far beyond.Everyone can get it wrong, especially those whose closely argued ideas are reduced to soundbites. And so it might yet prove with another of Fukuyamas pronouncements. It is his contention that the developed world has recently become more peaceable thanks to women as heads of state and in positions of political influence.Ive often heard people say there would be less conflict and fewer warswomen were in charge. Usually its the middle-aged and elderly ndash mothers, aunts and grandmothers ndash who make this claim. They have never scaled the heights of a male-dominated industry or profession, yet hope that the women they see in charge are imbued with the same gentle, conciliatory and nurturing personalities as themselves. And there, I would suggest, is the snag.Nor am I being unduly cynical. A study by the University of Chicago covering  years of European historyhas shown that not only were queens more inclined to take their country into battle than kings, but also more certain to win.:Nicola Sturgeon announces funding for women leaders schemeIn Victorias day, Britain was at war with some part of the empire, or would-be empire, almost every year of her reign. Three hundred years earlier, Elizabeth I set a gold standard for empire building, showing her mettle as she fought off Spanish incursions, despatching her own conquistadors across the globe, and managing to maintain stability in a precariously inflammable period of religious stre asshe were refereeing a game of croquet.The leader of the Chicago study, Professor Oeindrila Dube, points out that you need only think of Catherine the Great of Russia, or Isabella I of Castile to appreciate that, in previous centuries, royal women were every bit as war-like as men. When circumstances dictated, they didnrsquot hesitate to shed blood.Quite how they felt privately, of course, is another matter. Henry VIIIs daughter, who earned the title Bloody Mary after condemning almost  Protestants and religious dissenters to the pyre, was apparently a warm and affectionate person. What her notorious actions indicate, perhaps, is less a vengeful nature and more the vicious tenor of her times.Even our own Mary Queen of Scots was no peacenik, riding at the head of her troops on more than one occasion and, far from avoiding conflict, at times seeming actively to court it.Professor Dubersquos analysis of royal authority shows that when a queen was in power, she was even more effective than a man. Since she would often work in partnership with her consort, her subjects were effectively getting two warriors for the price of one. There is, however, a great dference between what was required of female rulers in the reign of Victoria and before, and attitudes in modern times.In almost every era prior to our own Elizabethan age, to be a woman was seen to be weak. Debate raged across Europe in the th century about how worthy and capable females could ever beplaced on a throne. John Knox, enraged at Mary of Guise becoming Regent of Scotland, spoke for many when he declared her appointment ldquoas seemly a sight as to put a saddle upon the back of an unruly cow.Given such hostility, itrsquos entirely possible that it was not the assistance of their husbands that made Boudiccas of high-ranking women, but the need to show that they were every bit as aggressive and dangerous as men. The message needed to be sent that anyone who tried to topple them would live ndash albeit briefly ndash to regret it.Margaret Thatcher thrust us into battle in the Falklands where many other prime ministers might have hesitated. You could see her pugnacity, on this and other inflammatory issues, as the problem with Fukuyamas theory. Women who reach the political pinnacle today have had to fight to get there. These are no ordinary women, these are powerful women. Hilary Clintonrsquos personality surely proves that point: her pitch for the presidency showed her to be a great deal more hawk than dove.:Project aims to help women stand for electionYet Fukuyama ndash and others ndash might nevertheless be right in hoping for a less violent futuremore women are at the top table. Nobody has done more to show Germany in a pacic and positively humanitarian light than Angela Merkel, even though she knew her policies risked her political standing in some quarters.To date, the performance of those like Mary Robinson, when she was Irish president, or Helle Thorning-Schmidt when Denmarkrsquos prime minister, or New Zealandrsquos Jacinda Ardern, not to mention Scotlands first minister, offers reason to hope. The ability to compromise, to use diplomatic means to defuse conflict, or find a way around an impasse is, while by no means solely a female quality, certainly one at which we are beginning to excel.Sweeping generalisation though it is, women are undoubtedly less physically combative and martial than men, though potentially nasty nevertheless.

And so it might yet prove with another of Fukuyamas pronouncements. It is his contention that the developed world has recently become more peaceable thanks to women as heads of state and in positions of political influence.Ive often heard people say there would be less conflict and fewer warswomen were in charge. Usually its the middle-aged and elderly ndash mothers, aunts and grandmothers ndash who make this claim. They have never scaled the heights of a male-dominated industry or profession, yet hope that the women they see in charge are imbued with the same gentle, conciliatory and nurturing personalities as themselves. And there, I would suggest, is the snag.Nor am I being unduly cynical. A study by the University of Chicago covering  years of European historyhas shown that not only were queens more inclined to take their country into battle than kings, but also more certain to win.:Nicola Sturgeon announces funding for women leaders schemeIn Victorias day, Britain was at war with some part of the empire, or would-be empire, almost every year of her reign. Three hundred years earlier, Elizabeth I set a gold standard for empire building, showing her mettle as she fought off Spanish incursions, despatching her own conquistadors across the globe, and managing to maintain stability in a precariously inflammable period of religious stre asshe were refereeing a game of croquet.The leader of the Chicago study, Professor Oeindrila Dube, points out that you need only think of Catherine the Great of Russia, or Isabella I of Castile to appreciate that, in previous centuries, royal women were every bit as war-like as men. When circumstances dictated, they didnrsquot hesitate to shed blood.Quite how they felt privately, of course, is another matter. Henry VIIIs daughter, who earned the title Bloody Mary after condemning almost  Protestants and religious dissenters to the pyre, was apparently a warm and affectionate person. What her notorious actions indicate, perhaps, is less a vengeful nature and more the vicious tenor of her times.Even our own Mary Queen of Scots was no peacenik, riding at the head of her troops on more than one occasion and, far from avoiding conflict, at times seeming actively to court it.Professor Dubersquos analysis of royal authority shows that when a queen was in power, she was even more effective than a man. Since she would often work in partnership with her consort, her subjects were effectively getting two warriors for the price of one. There is, however, a great dference between what was required of female rulers in the reign of Victoria and before, and attitudes in modern times.In almost every era prior to our own Elizabethan age, to be a woman was seen to be weak. Debate raged across Europe in the th century about how worthy and capable females could ever beplaced on a throne. John Knox, enraged at Mary of Guise becoming Regent of Scotland, spoke for many when he declared her appointment ldquoas seemly a sight as to put a saddle upon the back of an unruly cow.Given such hostility, itrsquos entirely possible that it was not the assistance of their husbands that made Boudiccas of high-ranking women, but the need to show that they were every bit as aggressive and dangerous as men. The message needed to be sent that anyone who tried to topple them would live ndash albeit briefly ndash to regret it.Margaret Thatcher thrust us into battle in the Falklands where many other prime ministers might have hesitated. You could see her pugnacity, on this and other inflammatory issues, as the problem with Fukuyamas theory. Women who reach the political pinnacle today have had to fight to get there. These are no ordinary women, these are powerful women. Hilary Clintonrsquos personality surely proves that point: her pitch for the presidency showed her to be a great deal more hawk than dove.:Project aims to help women stand for electionYet Fukuyama ndash and others ndash might nevertheless be right in hoping for a less violent futuremore women are at the top table. Nobody has done more to show Germany in a pacic and positively humanitarian light than Angela Merkel, even though she knew her policies risked her political standing in some quarters.To date, the performance of those like Mary Robinson, when she was Irish president, or Helle Thorning-Schmidt when Denmarkrsquos prime minister, or New Zealandrsquos Jacinda Ardern, not to mention Scotlands first minister, offers reason to hope. The ability to compromise, to use diplomatic means to defuse conflict, or find a way around an impasse is, while by no means solely a female quality, certainly one at which we are beginning to excel.Sweeping generalisation though it is, women are undoubtedly less physically combative and martial than men, though potentially nasty nevertheless. It can be seen as early as the school playground that our preferred weaponry is verbal attack and the ability to work stealthily, in ways of which Machiavelli would approve, to undermine the enemy.Irsquove never believed we are nicer than men ndash my experience has been quite the opposite.

The energy produced is enough to power an estimated , homes, but environmentalists claim biomass energy isn’t as green as it appears.Scotlands biomass sites generate enough energy to power , homes.When people think of clean energy, wind turbines and solar  often come to mind.But biomass power plants – a less well-known method of generating renewable electricity – are booming across the UK and environmental campaigners have raised doubts about their green credentials.The burning of trees or plant matter – known as plant biomass – now accounts for more than a fth of the UK’s renewable energy, second only to wind power.The number of plant biomass power plants in the UK has more than trebled in four years, from  in  to  in .Between them, they now produce enough energy to power around . million homes, analysis by the JPIMedia Data Unit has found.In Scotland, the number has quadrupled from  biomass sites in  to  by . Unlike other forms of green energy, biomass plants produce greenhouse gases. Across the country, the rise in biomass means its total greenhouse gas emissions have nearly reached the amount produced by coal. The industry says wood is sourced from renewable forests, with new trees being planted which store carbon and help to offset the emissions produced.But with the environment proving a key policy battleground in this year’s General Election, campaigners are calling for the practice to come under more scrutiny.Katja Garson, forest and climate campaigner at European campaign group Fern, said: “It is very concerning that in the global push to reduce emissions, more is not being said about the climate impacts of harvesting and burning wood.” Critics have also raised concerns that some power plants ship wood in from overseas, saying this has an added impact on the environment.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Controversial baby names.\"  Baby Names : here are the top  most controversial baby names for girlsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Launching this years festive campaign, the first since the introduction of new drug-driving laws, are, from left, Chief Inspector Darren Faulds, Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf, and Superintendent Louise Blakelock, Police Scotlands Deputy Head of Road Policing.\"  Zero tolerance approach to both drink and drug driving this festive season viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"The UK now imports . million tonnes of wood pellets a year, more than  times the amount imported a decade ago. Most comes from the USA and Canada, data from the Office for National Statistics shows.Campaigners are also urging the Government to rethink the £. billion in annual subsidies that the biomass industry gets.Almuth Ernsting, of the pressure group Biofuelwatch, said the Government should redirect subsidies to “genuinely low-carbon renewable energy” instead.“For the climate, electricity from forest biomass is no better than electricity from coal,” she said. “Both are completely incompatible with the need to rapidly reduce carbon emissions.”However, Benedict McAleenan, senior advisor to the Renewable Energy Association, said: “Pretending that biomass is somehow no better than coal means ignoring a whole host of facts. “It particularly misunderstands the way forestry works, ignores the important role of regulations and forgets the fact that trees are being regrown all the time.“In reality, UK rules are world-leading and prevent unsustainable practices.”Mr McAleenan said technology being developed called Carbon Capture and Storage would allow biomass plants to “suck carbon out of the atmosphere”, reducing the emissions they produce.He said it would not be possible for the UK to hit net zero-carbon without using bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage.Scotland’s carbon reduction ambitions came a step closer with ground-breaking new charter signed by Government and industry last week. A new alliance of industry, academics and Government officially launched Scotland’s programme to deliver the country’s programme of industrial decarbonisation through the deployment of the UK’s first carbon capture, usage and storagetechnology. The industry led coalition, known as NECCUS, will be instrumental in driving forward the development of CCUS which is recognised as essentialScotland is to meet its target of reducing the country’s carbon emissions to net zero by . CCUS is becoming increasingly commonplace around the world as a way of mitigating climate change. At its simplest, the technology involves capturing the carbon that is emitted from power plantsor energy intensive industries such as chemical and steel producers and then storing the greenhouse gas safely and permanently in rock formations deep below the seabed. Scotland’s project will take this technique further by creating hydrogen which can be used as an alternative to high carbon fuels such as coal, oil and gas for heat and power. CCUS coupled with hydrogen production alongside renewable energy and reforestation – as well as more sustainable production of food and consumer goods – is seen as an essential component of Scotland’s carbon emission reduction target five years before the rest of the UK.The first CCUS plant is expected to be operational by .Mike Smith, NECCUS CEO, said: “We’ve made great progress with wind, solar and other renewable technologies over the last  years. “But the need to decarbonise our economy is urgent so we must build on the good start the UK has made by addressing the hard to decarbonise sectors like heat, heavy industry, transport, and chemicals. “The only way we can achieve that is with the deployment of CCUS. NECCUS, with its unrivalled support from all sectors of industry, academia and Government is now set to deliver on doing just that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"December ,  at : pmToday marks the th anniversary of the Heart of Neolithic Orkney site gaining World Heritage status from UNESCO.

It is not clear what the basis for the legal challenge is but communities in Orkney and Shetland will be appalled at this latest development.“Island residents and businesses depend on these leline services. The letting of this contract has already been delayed by more than  months. Continued uncertainty over the future of the service is the last thing communities in Orkney and Shetland need.“Ministers must do everything possible to resolve this dispute as quickly as possible.#Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston slammed the SNP and said this legal action by the government-owned CalMac will lead to more uncertainty and delay for travellers.He said: “When factored in with the completely unacceptable delays with the two new ferries being built, the delays on reducing fares to Orkney and Shetland and its refusal to meet its pledge on fair funding for inter-island ferries this really is turning into a fiasco.“People in the islands want assurances that these vital links will be secure and that improvements to the service will start to get underway. But with the SNP in sole charge of transport for more than  years, things just keep getting worse.“This is what happens when you have a nationalist government completely distracted by the constitution.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not surprisingly, the prospect of this was enough to put some people off from coming forward in the first place.“Rape Crisis Orkney and others have rightly been highlighting the need to find ways of allowing examinations to take place. To their credit, successive Justice Ministers have responded positively since I first raised concerns with them over two years ago.#Since then, a lot of work has been carried out by ious organisations and iniduals to finding solutions that work for island communities but respect the need for equal access to services.“I, therefore, welcome the Forensic Medical Services Bill and its commitment to equal access across all health boards, including our islands.  The provision of support from the Taskforce to assist with creating and enhancing facilities to allow this to happen is also reassuring.#While some iniduals may still prefer to access services where, for a iety of reasons, what is key is that this is a matter of choice.“Hopefully, NHS Orkney working with local partners will now be able to build on the progress made to date so that we have a robust and sustainable local self-referral service in line with other parts of the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That legacy, in a way, is still here.#For us, coming to Orkney is a bit like coming home and I hope people will take that in a good sense.

The skies are grey, it’s getting dark by  o’clock, andit’s not raining, it’s bitterly cold. Most normal people are getting home from work, turning on the lights and the heating, and locking the door behind them.Spare a thought, then, for political campaigners out on the streets trying to win votes. These hardy souls, wrapped up against the rain and the cold, are there performing a public service, trying to persuade you of the merits of their particular candidate and gathering information about voting intentions. Almost entirely, they will be volunteers, not being paid to do this vital job, but out and about because of the passion they feel for their political cause.: General Election : D-Day pipes, otter mix-ups and democracy in action – Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP: Here’s how to escape Brexit-election mayhem – Bill JamiesonThe temptation might well be to refuse to open the door when the bell rings on a dark and cold afternoon, but show some sympathy for the poor canvassers.

However, reading results didn’t reach even  levels, are still far below the  and  figures, and behind those in England.Much more seriously, the scores in both maths and science are dismal. Scotland’s maths score is now at a record low, having dropped in every Pisa survey. Scotland was st overall in maths, below the OECD average, and behind countries like Latvia, Slovenia and the Czech Republic.And, when it comes to science, a skill vital for Scotland’s future economic development, there has been another drop, with scores falling in every Pisa survey since . Scotland now ranks th overall in science, with England th. For a country which supposedly once had the best education system in the world, these are deeply depressing statistics.: Pisa: Performance of Scottish pupils in maths and science at record low: The evidence that shows Scottish education’s critics are playing politics – John SwinneyThis fresh data comes on the back of figures which call into question the SNP Government’s approach towards reducing the attainment gap in secondary schools. New figures show the attainment gap between the most deprived and most affluent students is actually increasing in about  per cent of high schools, despite the provision of ‘pupil equity funding’ targeted at students from disadvantaged background.Among  secondary schools that received attainment funding of at least £,,  reported an improved performance by their most disadvantaged pupils, while  schools showed a decline. So there is precious little evidence that the approach being taken by the Scottish Government is paying idends, despite the funds being invested.Union idendThere is concern amongst the educational establishment about the lack of objective data on the performance of Scottish schools. It was the SNP in government who pulled Scotland out of Timss, a long-running, large-scale international assessment of mathematics and science education, and Pirls, which looks at trends in reading achievement. In addition, the Scottish Survey of Literacy and Numeracy has also been done away with, making it harder to measure what progress is being made.But what we can tell from the data that is published is that, far from seeing improvements across the board, and despite some additional resources being put in, there continue to be serious concerns about the performance of Scottish education. We could once compare ourselves favourably to school results south of the Border, but on most measures we are now trailing behind. And this is despite the fact that spending per head on education in Scotland is much higher than the UK average, thanks to the Union idend of nearly £, per person in Scotland – a Union idend which, of course, the SNP want to see taken away.With a general election just over a week away, it is data such as these which should be at the centre of the political debate. The First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, asked to be judged on her record on education. And yet, throughout the election campaign, we have seen a relentless focus from her party on just one issue: independence.Nicola Sturgeon has made it clear that every vote for the SNP in the general election is a vote in support of a second independence referendum. That is the one issue that SNP politicians are obsessed with, and it is little wonder that we see the failures in Scottish education exposed in the Pisa data when it is simply not the priority for Government that it should be.Scottish voters next Thursday have the opportunity to use the general election to send a very clear and simple message to the SNP Government: it is time to get back to the day job. Whether it is health, or the performance of the Scottish economy, or what is happening in our schools, Scotland is being let down. For so long as we have a Government that is obsessed with constitutional change, and refusing to tackle the real issues that affect our everyday lives, we are going to have to put up with second best.Murdo Fraser is a Conservative MSP for Mid-Scotland and Fe©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense. Scots are shrewd people and will not buy it.No, I was absent because I was at sea.#with Rees-Mogg hiding below decks I think she was campaigning in the SW of England.Not surprising. The Brexit party are all at sea.At least you were at sea doing an honest days work Robert, unlike the other candidates.

ministers were limited in what they can say, so as not to prejudice the outcome of those proceedings.However, Mr Wheelhouse said that the government remained fully committed to the provision of safe, effective and reliable ferry services to Shetland and Orkney.Mr Wheelhouse said: “Transport Scotland is liaising with the current operator, Serco Limited, to make arrangements for the extension of the current contract to maintain continuity of service and to ensure full connectivity to and from the Northern Isles.“This will mean that the local communities, passengers and businesses who rely on the services, and the staff who work on them, will not be affected by the legal proceedings and services will be run as normal throughout this period.”Mr Wheelhouse said the legal proceedings would not affect the recent commitment to fare reductions on Shetland routes for islanders, including a  per cent discount on cabin fares and a three-year fares freeze from January .Orkney MSP Liam McArthur said it was deeply disappointing that CalMac had chosen to go down this route. It was not clear what the basis for the legal challenge is but communities in Orkney and Shetland would be appalled at the latest development.He said: “Island residents and businesses depend on these leline services. The letting of this contract has already been delayed by more than  months. Continued uncertainty over the future of the service is the last thing communities in Orkney and Shetland need.“Ministers must do everything possible to resolve this dispute as quickly as possible”.Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart added: “Procurement for the next Northern Isles ferry service contract has been hit by a number of unacceptable delays which does nothing to reassure people in the Northern Isles that the government is committed to improving our leline ferry services.“It is imperative that this dispute is resolved as soon as possible in the best interests of people in Orkney and Shetland.”Highlands and Islands Tory MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston, who lives in Orkney, also weighed in over the situation.He said: “It’s quite incredible that the SNP is being sued by oneits own quangos.“It tells you everything you need to know about the mess the SNP government has made of ferry services that a publicly owned company wants to take it to court, leading to more uncertainty and delay for travellers.“When factored in with the completely unacceptable delays with the two new ferries being built, the delays on reducing fares to Orkney and Shetland and its refusal to meet its pledge on fair funding for inter-island ferries this really is turning into a fiasco.“People in the islands want assurances that these vital links will be secure and that improvements to the service will start to get underway.

Some people only come in one day, some come in two, some come in three. It depends on inidual needs.ldquoIrsquove been looking after older people from I was in my twenties. It doesnrsquot get any easier when they pass away.Wendy, whose twin sister Gilly also works for Age NI, is full time with the organisation while many others lend their support on a voluntary basis:ldquoThe volunteers are worth their weight in gold.

Set in an old theatre in the s, the former St Genevieve’s pupil’s take on the festive and timeless classic will take families of all ages through a journey as they watch all the characters come together to show Ebenezer Scrooge the error of his ways.“The MAC’s Christmas audience is quite young so to introduce three ghosts can become quite scary so you have to work with that,” she said. “They always say write what you know and I know the theatre. I’ve set the story in a theatre where Scrooge is a producer, along with Jacob Marley they were the big theatre producers of the day. There is a term in threatre called the ‘ghost light’ this would have been turned on through the night so that people, who were still working through, wouldn’t have fallen through the trapdoor. I loved that idea and thought this would work as a way to introduce our ghosts. “This theatre, which Scrooge is in charge of, isn’t making the profit it used to the ghosts come to le in the hope that Scrooge won’t close down the theatre. The kids who will be in the audience are helping us create this story and it’s a way to introduce such a classic to a younger audience,” she said. Having starred in panto since she was , Tara Lynne will also be starring in Xmas For Dummies at the Grand Opera House with Chris Robinson, “an adult take on the classic ’s film Mannequin,” set in Castle Street.“It’s an hour of a show, either before or after your Christmas party to come in and have a laugh with us. I’m only in one of them so you’ll not be sick of my face,” she laughed.Having wowed audiences with her Shirley Valentine at The Lyric stage earlier this year, Tara Lynne exclusively reveals that her one-woman tour de force is coming back in  for a new run. “I’m really excited to be coming back with the show. The amount of feedback we got from people for a -year-old play was amazing. Everybody was coming up to me saying how they had ‘got a bit of Shirley in me’.“You could’ve heard a pin drop most nights in The Lyric. The support for the piece was unbelievable, it is such a gt of a show.”When not writing, acting or preparing to travel to ‘Greece for a fortnight’, Tara Lynne will be donning ‘Ma’s’ wig again as filming for Derry Girls series three gets underway in April.“I can’t wait to see what Lisa has instore for this series, I don’t think anyone can wait. It’s all very top secret at the minute. The scripts are so good, let’s hope I don’t get killed off or leave in a black taxi as that’s what happened me in Eastenders,” she laughed.

O’Coineen has the ultimate dinner table boast – more people have been to the moon than have sailed around the world .This lonesome boatman’s ticket to sail came in the form of the Vendée Globe, the effectively year-long, round-the-world yacht race in which there is as much focus on finishing as in winning.It’s a risky business sailing into the tempest and braving both elements and unwelcome contact at night or in fog from fellow-vessels from military warships to cruise liners — one of which turned around at the insistence of worried passengers to check on the safety of our hero in his tiny skf.Replete with end-of-chapter tips and an introduction by President Higgins, Journey to the Edge is a lively and luminating read the perfect companion to his ’s business-primer memoir, The Unsinkable Entrepreneur.Now that he’s at the wheel of the Sunday Business Post — reborn as the Business Post at the weekend — O’Coineen is sure to have many adventures ahead, both on the high seas and on terra firma.Let’s leave the last word then with this Irish-speaking voyager proud to be flying the flag for the great seafaring nation of Ireland: “In a bizarre way, after achieving my sailing goal and dream, I can now set new horizons and get real joy, satisfaction and fulfilment in helping others achieve theirs.

Now, after waitingnearly a quarter-of-a-century for a correct diagnosis, she’s been told it’s too late for her to be cured of the spinal disorder spondylotic myelopathy.Margaret’s story began in  when she suffered a bad fall and was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra in her neck after a visit to the Mater. Days later, she was referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital who put the pain she was suffering down to an extra congenital rib that she was born with. Her chronic battle with pain took its toll to the extent that she had to quit her job in the Civil Service.Speaking to the North Belfast News in her Cedar Avenue flat, Margaret explained her long and painful journey to the truth began  years after her first fall.“I started having a series of bad falls in ,” she said. “In short, I was passed around dferent neurologists. I knew in my heart that something was wrong.“I was breaking bones all over my body. I just couldn’t balance. I was a patient of Dr Michael Watt. He diagnosed me with epilepsy, but I never took the medication because I never believed I had epilepsy.”On being recalled by Dr Watt last year, Margaret found out for the first time what a scan from the past had revealed.“It wasn’t until the recall that I was told a scan in  showed I had chronic spondylotic myelopathy, but now it was now too serious to be cured. I had been passed between neurology wards and GPs for over  years and the reality was that my diagnosis was known in  but nobody told me.“I only found out I had this condition because I was a recall patient for something .“How many more people are out there similar to me who haven’t been diagnosed with myelopathy “It is estimated that one in four people could have it. I would say to anyone who suffers from compression in the back, slipped discs, oryou are dropping things or have tingling in the hands, that you may have myelopathy.”A tearful Margaret added: “I will end up in a wheelchair. I will lose the power of my arms and not be able to feed myself because my diagnosis went on so long.“I feel very alone. I don’t know anyone  with it.“The sad reality is that this condition can be preventedit is discovered early enough.”Margaret wants to use her heartbreaking story to reach out to others and raise awareness of myelopathy to let them know they are not alone.She recently ed from a trip to New York to meet fellow patients and top neurologists from across the world at a myelopathy conference.“Myelopathy is out there but people don’t know they have it,” she added. “I want to focus on the disease and its progressionnot treated. Myelopathy is a degenerative disease and there are guidelines on when to operate.“Unfortunately for me, I wasn’t treated sooner and it may have slowed the condition down.“I suffered for years not knowing what was wrong with me.“There is no support here in Northern Ireland. I don’t know where I would be without the support of myelopathy.org, Spinal Injuries Association and AOSpine as well as Cambridge University who are pioneering more research and work into the condition.“We need to talk about myelopathy. If I was living in England I would have been treated quicker.“I am worried about the future because it has been left to deteriorate for so long.”Margaret said she wanted to thank Belfast Back Care for their treatment and Archie Coogan for his holistic therapies.If you suffer from, or believe you suffer from, myelopathy, you can get in touch with Margaret Reeves atMargaret-@hotmail."},{"url":null,"title":"dissidents santa with rifle image condemned by the psni","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

The SDLP were out in force on the ground in the Lower Ormeau and the Markets this week.SDLP’s Claire HannaAs her partys most high-profile MLA on broadcast media, and with personal and family links to the constituency dating back decades, Hanna has a strong hand generally.She is also fortunate in her main unionist opponent. In neighbouring East Belfast, DUP MP Gavin Robinson has kept a relatively low-profile. He hasnt antagonised those who didnt vote for him.The same cannot be said of Little-Pengelly in South Belfast. When she was elected, she had the opportunity to build bridges with nationalists and others in this most erse constituency - as an act of self-preservationnothing .DUP’s Emma Little-PengellyInstead, she became involved in rows over bonfires and UVF flags. It was unwise to antagonise those who otherwise might have developed a civil relationship with a reconciliatory and progressive DUP MP.Yet Little-Pengelly certainly cant be written off in next months poll. She has a fine electoral track record in this constituency. She increased her partys vote by an impressive % between  and , something for which she is given insufficient credit.She is a prodigious constituency worker. Despite Ulster Unionist Michael Henderson standing, she should secure a massive unionist vote.DUP Balmoral councillor David Graham is running her campaign, and doesnt think it is a lost cause.\"Emma got over , votes last time, and there is room for growth in our core area,\" he says.\"If you compare our  bestboxes in the constituency with the top  nationalist boxes in  - when we did exceptionally well - there was still a far higher proportion of people in our best areas who didnt vote or werent even registered.\"Weve done a lot of work on the ground to change that, and unionist voters are very motivated for this election. Emma grew unionist turnout in , and we need to do that again. I think we will as people realise it has never been more important to defend the Union.\"Graham also cites the outgoing MPs grassroots endeavours: \"Emma has dealt with over , cases in her office in her two years as an MP. Christopher Stalford is a hard-working MLA and we have an excellent council team locally. That helps us hugely.\"Alliance Party’s Paula Bradshaw The key to the DUPs chances is how Alliance fares. If the Remain camp is fairly evenly split and Hanna doesnt pull signicantly ahead of Bradshaw, then Little-Pengelly should win.Support for Bradshaw next month is dficult to predict. The SDLP was , votes ahead of Alliance in . Yet the Naomi factor and the partys extraordinary success in the EU election may have changed the dynamic.Alliance surged ahead of the SDLP in Mays council poll. But the fact Bradshaw stood as an Ulster Unionist Conservative candidate in  might limit her reach more than it would an Alliance candidate without such a history.Ray Kennedy was the SDLPs election guru in South Belfast for two decades. He ran Alasdair McDonnells campaigns. He says: \"This seat is now Claire Hannas to lose.

It has raised fears that the poorest Egyptians, already squeezed by economic austerity measures, will shoulder the bulk of the burden.“I’d rather work as a thief than pay for this minivan,” said Ehab Sobhy, a -year-old who earns  Egyptian poundsa day plying the densely packed district of Shobra in his weathered black-and-yellow tuk-tuk, sporting a decorative Islamic sticker in place of a licence.“If they take this away … how is my family going to eat ” asked Mr Sobhy. Even with a government loan, he said he would not be able to afford the , pounds he estimates he would need for the new minivan.“They’ll bring money to the banks, all at the expense of the people,” declared Mohammed Zaydan, a -year-old father of five who started driving a tuk-tuk after struggling to find work as a painter. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Tuk-tuk drivers make their way on a street in a slum area of Cairo “If they ban the tuk-tuk, they trample on the poor.”Former president Hosni Mubarak’s government tried to stem the tide of tuk-tuks, banning them in most of Cairo’s affluent neighbourhoods, but it also allowed tuk-tuk parts to flow from South Asia to Egypt, where vehicle manufacturers legally assembled and sold the unlicensed vehicles.It was a classic example of the state’s contradictory approach towards the informal economy, which accounts for as much as % to % of Egypt’s GDP, according to the International Labour Organisation.“Because of its limited capacities, the state lives with deeply embedded informality,” or do-it-yourself infrastructure, like unauthorised housing, which saves the government from providing mass services to the poor, said Amr Adly, a Cairo-based political economy expert.The business exploded, with rickshaws becoming especially popular with disabled people, the elderly and women who want to avoid harassment at crowded bus stops.But that could soon change.Now President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi’s government, which has spent the past five years trying to revamp Egypt’s image, is taking aim at the unregulated vehicles.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A tuk-tuk driver washes his vehicle Last year, it passed a traffic law requiring that all new buyers license their tuk-tuks. Ghabbour Group, the country’s largest vehicle producer, was hard hit, its tuk-tuk sales dropping by %.In September, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly announced a sweeping plan to phase out tuk-tuks in  governorates, swapping them for seven-seater minivans. The proposal, offering drivers a payoff period of up to five years, bars all tuk-tuks from cities and main roads but allows new and licensed tuk-tuks to continue operating in narrow alleys and rural villages.Egypt’s finance and military production ministries, along with three major vehicle manufacturers, have opened an economic review to hammer out the details and expect the microbuses to hit the streets within a year.El-Qassim, the spokesman for the development ministry, said the tuk-tuks contribute to congestion, air pollution and fatal car crashes – even terrorism, since the government cannot trace unlicensed vehicles. He described them as a drag on Egypt’s economic productivity, keeping teenagers out of school and depriving the state of revenue from registration fees and taxes.But sceptics question the logic of changing a tuk-tuk prized for its tiny size, high manoeuvrability and cheap fare for a microbus that manufacturers expect to be four times the size and price.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A driver manoeuvres his tuk-tuk in a narrow alleyway “It’s a reflection of how the state is more obsessed with appearances than investing in the infrastructure of where people actually live,” said Rabab el-Mahdi, a political scientist at the American University in Cairo.Since taking power in , Mr el-Sissi has focused on ambitious mega-projects, building high-end housing complexes and a sprawling  billion dollar new administrative capital in the desert outside Cairo. The bigger goal is to revive tourism and attract foreign investment as the country recovers from the turmoil of the  Arab Spring uprising that toppled Mr Mubarak.Meanwhile, much of Cairo has spiralled into disrepair and decay. The official statistics agency recently reported that one third of Egyptians live in poverty.Tough austerity measures imposed to stave off economic collapse have slashed subsidies and dramatically hiked up prices of everything from subway fares to drinking water, taking a heavy toll on working-class Egyptians.In September, sharp economic discontent and allegations of government corruption marshalled small but rare protests against the president. Security forces arrested thousands, escalating a long-running crackdown.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Citizens help tuk-tuk drivers manoeuvre in traffic “The state is much more willing and able to go down with a heavy hand,” said el-Mahdi, adding that the military mindset has created a government-wide sht.Still, observers note that enforcing the new plan will pose a challenge. Much remains uncertain, including how the government will guarantee registration among those more accustomed to bribing police than obeying traffic laws.“People will be trying to resist, to circumvent these developments, to go on living,” said Yasser Elsheshtawy, professor of architecture at Columbia University. “This is something very Egyptian.”"},{"url":null,"title":"498784","story":"A Castledawson woman celebrated her th birthday by raising cash towards a special Talking Book service for those living with severe sight problems.By asking friends and family for donations, Margaret Brown raised an amazing pound towards the Mid Ulster Talking Book Challenge for the Royal National Institute of Blind people .Margaret has enjoyed Talking Books for many years since her central vision started to deteriorate in her s due to age-related macular degeneration. When her family suggested the alternative gt idea Margaret was delighted, saying: “That’s a great idea. Sure I don’t need anything!”Margaret’s daughter Irene said: “Friends and family were very generous and we had a lovely get together in the home for mum. “Of course she got other little things as well, but mum really appreciated the donations towards RNIB.“She’s had a lot of support from RNIB’s local Community Access Worker Jackie Cotton, and Mark Waterman from sensory support over the years, making sure she has anything to make le that bit easier and more enjoyable. “She’s been stocked with Talking Books and newspapers, has a talking watch and clock and lots of other things they’ve suggested.“She also really enjoyed attending the local Insight visually impaired group, facilitated by Jackie, for many years. “I would have accompanied her on trips and dinners. She loved them. “With her more limited mobility now she loves her talking books, particularly biographies in these later years, and listening to gospel music and speakers.”Jackie Cotton, RNIB’s Community Access Worker for the Mid Ulster Area said: We’re so grateful to Margaret, Irene and their family and friends for supporting the Mid Ulster Community Talking Book Challenge.“In the past year we’ve seen a % increase in RNIB Talking Books subscribers so we know this service is in demand from people in the local community.“Their donations will help us create even more books for people of all ages to enjoy for years to come.“RNIB is committed to making every day better for blind and partially sighted people across Northern Ireland, but we simply cant do it alone. “Right now, we can only support one in three people affected by sight loss, but together, we can smash the barriers that stop people with sight loss thriving.”If you’d like to join the community effort to sponsor RNIB Talking Books, don’t hesitate to contact RNIB NI’s Area Fundraising Manager Hazel Stirling onhazel.stirling@rnib.org.ukor  .

The main political parties’ repeated failure to stand up for nurses is responsible fo the unacceptable conditions in which they have to work, and responsible, therefore, for the ‘unprecedented’ industrial action.“We need to stem the steady drip of skilled nurses emigrating, because, along with inequality in pay, the shortage of nurses here results in an unacceptable, sometimes unsustainable workload. “Recently, the paediatric ward in Derry lost one of the best young nurses I have ever had the pleasure of working with, leaving her family and friends in the mouth of Christmas for better working conditions and a decent wage in Australia. “We must act before the steady drip becomes a tide.  Aontuacute is committed to supporting all healthcare workers. They are there for us when we need them we are there for them when they need us.”Dr McNicholl says he also wants a New Ireland which will “unite Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter”, offering economic and social justice and providing housing, health and social care for those most in need.Aontuacute is opposed to the cyanide gold mining in the Sperrins and Seaacuten is particularly concerned about the risk to the health of the local people, the destruction of the natural habitat of our native animals and the ravaging of the beauty of the landscape.The current uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the likely reality of Brexit are a great source of concern for Ireland North and South, but Seaacuten moves forward with Aontuacute towards the creation of a borderless and free New Ireland. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

That is the hub where everything comes for sorting and distribution to the other shops but we decided to open it up to the public.”Christmas fundraisingChristmas is a busy time for the hospice fundraising team with annual events such as Lights of Love where people can sponsor lights on a large Christmas tree at the hospice which is provided by Derry City and Strabane District Council.Hampers are also a big part of the hospice’s fundraising at this time of year. Pauline McGuinness, a volunteer, helps prepare  Christmas hampers to go out to shops and businesses across the north-west for a draw with each one raising about pound.“This is an old-fashioned fundraiser,” community fundraising officer Ailbhe Temple says.“It’s a big fundraiser for us. We go out at Christmas and Easter with  hampers and do a few Halloween ones as well.”Coin HuntHundreds of collection boxes are part of the hospice’s fundraising activity. The Coin Hunt boxes are emptied at the Fundraising Centre and counted five days a week. A total of over pound, in coins was counted last year.A reduction in loose change due to the increase in card transactions has seen a drop in the income from the coin boxes, Damien Brown who counts the coins says.“It used to be over pound,. We are aware that more and more people are going cashless and are looking at ways how we might best address that to ensure continued support,” he said.Unique serviceThe importance of fundraising to the hospice is that it allows it to provide the unique service it does, Ailbhe Temple, Community Fundraising Officersays, not just in terms of specialised medical care but the time and attention patients get.“We have time here. Our nurses have time to speak to patients, time to spend with patients and time to spend with family members. That is an important part of what we do, especially at end of le when you are not going to get it back again. Our focus is the patient and that the patients needs are met.”Those needs have included the hosting of a number of weddings for patients and providing whatever home comforts they desire.“It’s about making people comfortable at that time because it is such a dficult time. It’s a nice place and everyone can get involved in the care. It’s not just medical, medical, medical.”The funding comes from weekly draws, the shops, coin hunt, male and female walks and fundraising events like the London Marathon, the Great North Run and other local events and donations.FundraisingFundraising is getting more dficult in terms of events, Ailbhe says.“I think it goes back to the fact that so much goes on in the city. It is a struggle to raise money and we are always trying to think of something dferent but not too dferent because you want people to get involved.“But the people of Derry and Strabane and the surrounding areas are amazing. “We get over poundm a year andwe didn’t have that support, we would not be here and would not be able to support the , patients we have supported in the last  years.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The lecture examined the history of Gaelic in the context of Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man, plus the wider backdrop of Celtic and other languages in Western Europe. Island Voices is an annual series that explores the languages, cultures and heritages of these islands with a particular emphasis on the Irish and Ulster Scots traditions. The theme of this year’s series was‘Irish and Ulster-Scots: Language and Belonging’ and there were three talks in the programme. googletag.cmd.push A range of themes are covered including the interplay between the languages of English, Irish and Ulster-Scots in our place names Ulster-Scots identity as expressed in the language and literature of the North of Ireland and the development and expansion of the Gaelic language throughout these islands over two millennia.

So, what is the connection between Hippocrates the father of medicine, an ancient oriental tree, a Greek born medical consultant and the section of Derry’s Walls that the terraced houses of Nailors’ Row once nestled under  Every week, hundreds, maybe thousands of us, walk through historic Bishop’s Gate to and from the city centre. But how many of us pay more than a cursory glance to the beautul patch of sculpted greenery that lies on the right-hand side of the road just outside the walled city  googletag.cmd.push In your mind you may have fleetingly admired its prettiness and thought it a vast improvement on the strip of plain grass that used be there. Just around the corner from the end of the garden, it gives way to steep green slopes that roll downwards the Bogside. It is a site that has seen its fair share of trouble over the decades standing as it does right on the boundary between the Fountain and the Bogside. The at times, serious sectarian clashes there have seen it labelled with one of those cold and condemnatory Northern Ireland terms – interface. However, since November  that small piece of land right in the middle of the often wrongly maligned trouble spot has stood as a quiet beacon to something that should truly uny us all – the gt of good health. googletag.cmd.push It is known as the New Le Garden and is a place of reflection for those who have been given a second crack at existence through organ donation. Whilst the garden is dedicated to all those who have both received and given all transplantable organs either as living donors or through donation after death, a local group based at the city’s hospital has championed the garden and the spirit in which it was created. The words on a stone monument in the heart of the garden erected by the Altnagelvin Renal Support Group state: “This Garden of Le celebrates the gt of new le through organ donation and gives thanks to all organ donors, both living and deceased, for their tremendous generosity and empathy in providing new le through their selfless sacrice.” When the garden was opened six years ago, the official ceremony was attended by representatives of all the city’s main churches, the Northern Ireland Kidney Patients Association, the Fountain and Bogside communities, residents of nearby Alexander House and many people from the then Derry City Council who backed the project. The commemorative garden was also integrated with St Columba’s Peace Garden which occupies the same space. On a chosen Sunday each Christmas time since , as people with arms weighed down with shopping bags in preparation for the festive period hurry by, a group of people gather at the garden to do what it says on the monument – give thanks and remember. The annual ceremony isn’t one that pays attention to either pomp or circumstance. Instead, it’s conducted quietly and reverently, consisting mainly of a few meaningful, heartfelt words by someone who has faced the crushing ordeal of facing leaving le before the inexpressible and joyous relief of having it prolonged by those who have been kind and brave enough to donate. Prayers and a few well-chosen hymns and songs only add to the poignancy of the occasion. With each passing year some of the faces are no longer there, but their families are. New faces are also there – new because they have been added to the list awaiting a new kidney, a new heart, liver or lung. Those who already have done or are waiting to provide a new lease of le are also there, as are the families of those who by their passing handed on extended le to many others. The garden is also where those awaiting a transplant can visit and gain strength. What however, has that got to do with Hippocrates, an ancient oriental tree and specialist medic from modern Greece  The Plane Tree of Kos, or the Tree of Hippocrates according to legend, is the place where in ancient Greece the father of medicine taught his students. The current -foot high tree in the centre of Kos is only around  years old but is believed to be a descendant of the original tree which stood there over two and a half thousand years ago. Seeds or cuttings from the tree have been transported all over the world and one will soon be planted at the New Le Garden in Derry. It will not be the first time a cutting of the famed tree has been placed in Northern Ireland. The practice was first initiated by an intriguing doctor who landed on these shores in the s and who sadly passed away in . Dr Dimitrios Oreopoulous was born in Alexandroupolis and was one of five brothers who grew up in impoverished circumstances. However, he managed to get admitted to the medical school at the University of Athens and received his specialist certicate in . He then moved to the City Hospital in Belfast as a renal registrar where he completed his PhD in nephrology. Upon completion of his studies in Belfast Dr Oreopoulous was recruited by the Toronto Western Hospital where he continued his research at the Metabolic Renal Unit. It was in  whilst studying at Queen’s that the Greek medic presented seeds from the Plane Tree of Kos to both the university and Erskine House at the City Hospital where it continues to thrive to this day. In fact, in , the Erskine House Tree was nominated and won the Woodland Trust’s Tree of the Year competition. In turn, Dr James Douglas, former consultant Nephrologist at Belfast City Hospital, took several cuttings from the Erskine House Tree and these have now matured into saplings ready to be transferred to the New Le Gardens across Northern Ireland. Outside of Derry, other gardens can be found at Kiltonga in Newtonards and at Botanic Gardens in Belfast next door to Queen’s University. Patron of Northern Ireland Kidney Patients, Eamonn Holmes said of the tree at Belfast City Hospital being named tree of the year: “The Erskine House Tree means many things to many dferent people throughout the world, especially the transplant family. I am delighted that the tree has received prestigious accolade and will forever remain a symbol of the ‘Gt of Le’ and a representation of our brave organ donors.” According to the Department of Health, around  people are waiting for an organ transplant, and sadly, around  people die each year while on the waiting list. If you want to add your name to the NHS Organ Donor Register you can either register online at the Organ Donation NI website at https:www.organdonationni.info  or telephone    . A lesser known option is the possibility of becoming a living donor and the most common type in this respect is kidney donation. This takes place when one kidney is removed from a healthy person and transplanted into someone , often a relative. Quite rightly, the NHS point out that this is a major decision to make and everyone who comes forward undergoes a thorough assessment. All live donors and recipients are reviewed by an independent assessor who makes sure there is no pressure or coercion involved and that all parties understand the risks of complications. To make the distinction, the Organ Donor Register is only for those who wish to donate after death – to become a living donor, you must contact a transplant centre directly. The Living Donation Kidney Transplant Team can be contacted at Belfast City Hospital also on    . The team have also released a strategy paper on live kidney donation which can be viewed at https:www.odt.nhs.uk odt-structures-and-standards key-strategies living-donor-transplantation-strategy- . The annual service of remembrance organised by the Altnagelvin Renal Support Group, including the planting of the Plane tree sapling, takes place this year on Sunday, December  at the New Le Garden, Nailors Row at pm.

Last week, with victory over St Killians Garron Tower, they annexed the Liatroim Fontenoys Cup for the first-time in the schools history. St Colms lost to four time winners St Pius Magherafelt in the  final but this time, they went one better. Despite inclement weather at Bellaghys Drumanee training complex, St Colms dug deep to see off a fancied St Killians side in the closing stages. googletag.cmd.push Just two points separated them at the break and the teams were level as the clock ticked towards full-time but late points from Sineacutead McGuigan and Aoe Doyle edged St Colms over the line. It was a victory built on a solid defensive footing. St Killians bagged four first-half goals in their semi-final replay win over Loreto but Clodagh McPeake and Niamh Grahamwere kept under wraps. St Colms had a five week lay-off since their last competitive game, due to  of coach Fiona Devlins squad being involved in the schools musical production of Oliver. googletag.cmd.push “The girls remained focused but could have been frustrated but I didnt allow this mentality to set in as we knew the final was in the very near future. It was a matter of keeping the head down and working hard on the training field,” Devlin outlined. “With the assistance of Ballinascreen club, we played a mix of St Colms seniors and other girls from the club of a similar age the Sunday before the final. “This collective meeting was absolutely essential, from a mental perspective, to get the team focused and be ready for the match situation.” In the end, their battling qualities came to the fore to force them over the finish line with captain Aoe Doyle thwarting McPeake in the closing stages when a St Killians goal would have turned the tables. In the final analysis Doyle proved the dference and St Colms move forward into the All-Ireland series in the new year, armed with the experiences gained from last seasons run. Doyle, was marshalled well by Orla Donnelly when she began the game at full-forward, before a reshuffle changed the shape of the St Colms team. Ciara Scullion, with illness, was a doubt going into the game and only lasted to half-time. Doyle went to midfield, and with Erin Kelly putting a tremendous sht on Scullions opponent, it left Doyle free to impose herself on St Killians. THREE NIL Conditions were dficult and heavy underfoot following some heavy showers just before throw-in, but both teams worked hard from start to finish and most of the scores at both ends came from placed balls. Draperstown got off to a quick start with three Sineacutead McGuigan frees within the opening six minutes and with St Killians getting four first-half goals in their semi-final replay, this was a positive start from St Colms. Niamh Graham, who bagged - in their win over Loreto, pointed three frees to level the game after  minutes. St Killians then hit Draperstown for a goal. A long ball into the danger area wasnt cleared and Clodagh McPeake finished to the net. St Colms reply was instant and almost a carbon copy. An Aoe Doyle free caused panic in the St Killians defence and Mary Jo McEldowney was on hand to nab a goal and level the game once again. The Tower controlled much of the half and will rue not being further in the lead, despite Graham and Sine Woodhouse giving them a slender lead. Half-time:St Killians -St Colms - “Excellent pressure from our defence resulted in possible scores for St Killians going wide.” Devlin admitted. “So essentially we were going into the second-half believing that this final was in our grasp, one score would make the dference and with dogged determination those girls delivered inside three minutes of the second-half with a magnicent goal.” A free from Doyle was finished to the net by Grace Kelly and St Colms were back in front. Seconds later, St Killians had a chance to regain their lead but Niamh Graham saw her penalty saved by Rhiannah O’Neill. For the rest of the game, as the weather and conditions worsened, the game transformed into a battle and both teams were well matched. With eight minutes remaining, Niamh Graham brought the sides leveland a draw wasnt out of the question but Aoe Doyle had other ideas. She gathered a loose sliotar before slotting over St Colms first and only point from play, putting them back in front. She then won a free, allowing Sineacutead McGuigan to pop over the insurance point but St Killians werent finished yet. They mounted one last attack but when Clodagh McPeake attempted to conjure a winning goal it was Doyle who tracked back to cut out the danger. It ended St Killians comeback hopes and ensured another piece of silverware was on its way back to St Colms. Fiona Devlin hailed the work-rate and the intensity her side operated at, evening in those crucial closing stages. It epitomised their spirit. “When St Killians went on that final attack in injury time, the girls were exhausted with the heavy under foot conditions but they dug deep and you could see leaders all over the pitch taking responsibility, to ensure no goal was conceded,” she explains. “Aoe Doyle was back helping out her defence in true style at the finish. The heroic save young Rhiannah ONeill made, in nets, followed by her full-back line putting their bodies on the line and got ball the out to Aoe - epitomised the determination and resolve of all the girls.” The win puts them on the All-Ireland trail in February, something Devlin feels is bonus territory for her side. However, it is something they will relish and the experience quite a number of the squad have from last year will be an advantage. “Moving up a grade this year never phased them, they looked forward to each game and as the competition progressed they believed they were in with a chance of lting the Liatroim Fontenoys Cup for the first time in the schools history,” Devlin stressed. “Even though this journey so far has been remarkable for these girls at St Colms High school, it must be remembered they all hail from the Ballinascreen camogie club and together with their families,  and the wider community - they have all played a massive part in achieving this Ulster title.” MATCH STATS: St Colm’s: Rhiannah O’Neill, Leanne McCullagh, Shannon Scullion, Niamh Hamill, Rachel McCullagh, Cliodhna Hickson, Ciara Scullion, Erin Kelly, Cara Donnelly, Anna McDaid, Sineacutead McGuigan , Mary Jo McEldowney , Shannon Burns, Aoe Doyle , Grace Kelly .

Sub: Cara O’Boyle for A Donnelly . Ref: Sean McGuigan . PLAYER OF THE MATCH Aoe Doyle - There were outstanding performances from Shannon Scullion, Cliodhna Hickson, Erin Kelly and Sineacutead McGuigan. However, Aoe Doyle was the stand out player. She won frees inside in the early stages which were crucial. Her second-half performance was immense. From setting Grace Kelly up for the goal to finding the legs to retreat and help her defence, especially in injury time. TURNING POINT Second-half start – St Colms trailed by two at the break and need a hell of a start to the second-half. Grace Kellys goal was vital, in that it lted St Colms but when St Killians were awarded a penalty in the next attack, they needed a vital save on the line from Rhiannah O’Neill, before Cliodhna Hicksons clearance. A massive moment. SCORE OF THE GAME Kelly goal – Three minutes into the second-half, Aoe Doyle was fouled at midfield but she didnt stand on ceremony. Instinctively, she delivered a perfect ball to Grace who caught it, turned and she had only one thing on her mind – goal. It was an almighty score from such a young player.

Laura Kelly took part in a special session with Lisa Lavery, who has twenty years’ experience in the industry, through the ScreenWorks programme which offers specialist training sessions. Like all ScreenWorks sessions, the Costume Design programme gave students a real insight into what it’s like to work in the industry. The young people taking part visited the Ulster Museum to see real period costumes andwas able to create a mask to their own design. The aim was to allow the young people to explore their creativity and gain a good understanding of the job. googletag.cmd.push “The industry has changed massively from when I started, said Lisa. There was so little work then but there’s been an explosion of opportunity here in Northern Ireland and it’s so important that we share our skills with young people. It took me a long time to learn the nuances of the job and I think it’s essential to share what I learned with people like Laura,” she said. Since the programme started in ,  young people have benefitted from the teaching and guidance of highly successful industry professionals. In , there are  more sessions available in a range of topics such as production accountancy, location scouting, catering, hair and make-up and animation. googletag.cmd.push The aim is to help students explore career options, develop skills that will help them in their careers and courses and to continue to build a highly skilled talent pool to benefit the industry. Sean Boyle from Into Film explained that the courses are a great opportunity for young people to learn tips and techniques from professionals in the industry. He said: “There are so many dferent jobs available in these industries but often young people and their teachers and parents aren’t aware of the opportunities available right here in Northern Ireland.” There are several ScreenWorks sessions coming up in Derry.

Whilst they did come from behind to eventually win, they could well have made the game safe, even before half time, such was their dominance in possession, but their decision making when it mattered cost them several points and allowed Bangor to remain in the game right to the last. City of Derry were left grateful that Bangor missed what would have been a game winning penalty from m with just three minutes to go, but ultimately this was a deserved victory for the visitors who now have that poor away record off their backs. googletag.cmd.push Early scoreDerry started well on Saturday and got their reward in the opening minutes as full-back David Graham touched down in the corner and with McDonnell converting, the visitors had a - lead.Rather than build on that however, Derry found themselves on the back foot and they conceded within minutes as their lead quickly disappeared – second row Declan Horrix crashing over and with Rhys Larmour converting the game was tied at -.From a strong early lead, Derry then found themsleves chasing the game as Bangor built on that momentum to score a second try - Ally Lockhart feeding Jamie Clegg who released Mark Widdowson to score in the corner. Larmour again converted and Derry were chasing the game at -.The score stayed that way into half time, which was bizarre given the dominance of Derry for the majority of the half – the visitors dominated possession and territory but were guilty of too many unforced errors in the Bangor , with a missed penalty just before the break also not helping matters, the ball striking the post to keeping Bangor ahead.Derry continued to apply pressure in the early stages of the second half and that eventually told as they finally got their second try – Stephen Corr scoring, but a missed conversion meant that they still trailed by two points.A penalty by McDonnell minutes later put the visitors back into the lead however and with less than  minutes on the clock it was Derrys to lose. They continued to dominate but couldnt add to their tally and that could have cost them as they conceded a scorable penalty with three minutes left on the clock – Larmour stepped up to win the game but his effort was off target, much to the relief of the Derry players, who had done more than enough to win this game in the  minutes previous. googletag.cmd.push City of Derry: J Hamilton, R Harkin, S Duffy, G Doherty, Q Warmerdam, S Corr, T Thorton, R Baird, M Rankin, A McDonnell, T Cole, D Posternak, D Lapsley, C OHagan, D Graham.

The property also benefits from an integral garage.A key feature of the island is the direct road access to the mainland via Castle Island Road and onto Strangford Road which connects Strangford with Downpatrick.The new owners will share the island with Quoile Yacht Club, which offers some of the finest facilities in Strangford Lough, and the Quoile Pondage Nature Reserve and Bird Hide.The enclosed garden and grounds at the house extend to . acres and slope from the house to Castle Island Road and include manicured lawns and mature trees which provide shelter and amenity. There is also a small gravel area next to the house with trees and shrubs.An extensive block of farmland lies within a perimeter fence and is well suited for the grazing of livestock and production of silage hay.Estate agents Osborne King say that while nestled in private surroundings, the island conveniently lies a short distance from several towns including Downpatrick.While there is an abundance of amenities on the island including wildle, and sporting opportunities, there are also plenty of interest points nearby, including Castle Ward and Delamont Country Park.Gavin Clarke, from Osborne King, says the property has been on the market for over a week and is already generating interest from potential buyers.ldquoThis delightful property would make an ideal second home or, alternatively, a main family residence, given its tranquil location and magnicent views, with the Mournes to one side and Strangford on the other, he said.ldquoThe current owners have lived there for around  years and while they are very sorry to see it go, they look forward to seeing others benefit from it. The bungalow is ready to walk into as it has been well maintained down through the years.Gavin added: ldquoWith a couple of viewings in the pipeline, it would be nice to sell this side of Christmas.Further information is available from the Osborne King office, Donegal Square South, Belfast on    or email property@osborneking..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Businesswoman.jpg","title":"Businesswomen mentor Assumption students  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH students have taken part in their first management programme that promotes womenrsquos capacity for leadership.Over  sixth form girls at Assumption Grammar School spent the day recently shadowing female leaders in a range of industries including financial services, recruitment, law, media, construction and health, last month.SistersIN Female Leadership Programme, was launched this year to help foster girlsrsquo confidence in leadership roles.Organisers say it gave those taking part an opportunity to work alongside a female mentor at CEO, director or partner level across several trades in which women continue to be underrepresented at the top.Projects and communications assistant Hannah Magorrian said: ldquoAfter spending the day with mentors, the students develop their leadership skills in school, leading initiatives including mental health, peer mentoring, photography, sport, music, drama, debating, literacy, creative writing, religion and coding.ldquoThe school hopes these pupil-led initiatives will provide a legacy that benefits the whole school and wider community.ldquoIn line with the ethos at the heart of Assumption Grammar School, the pupils have already spent time with female leaders in local charities.She continued: ldquoThe school is currently working with its sister Assumption schools in South Africa to develop a parallel initiative with the aim of empowering African girls to become future leaders.ldquoThis global aspect of the SistersIN programme is reaching out to a country where females are vastly underrepresented at senior management and executive levels.The SistersIN Female Leadership Programme is being piloted in Assumption Grammar School this year, in association with Women in Business.Pupils will have two further leadership experience days, working with female leaders, on February  and June  when they will gain a dferent experience of leadership from one of over  partner industries..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Celebration.jpg","title":"Celebration time for Aughlisnafin  ","story":"AUGHLISNAFIN GAC held their annual presentations and dinner in the Burrendale Hotel last Saturday evening with Armagh and Crossmaglen Rangers legend Oisin McConville as the special guest.Major awards were as follows: seniors mdash managerrsquos player of the year, Donagh Steele managerrsquos sportsperson, Sean Fitzsimmons playersrsquo player, Donagh Steele.Minors mdash managerrsquos player, Morgan Croskery managerrsquos sportsperson, Peter OrsquoHare playersrsquo player, Ben Ogle.Senior players Oran Flanagan and Oisin OrsquoToole, received a commemorative league winners shield, on behalf of the squad, which has the names of every player and the management team engraved on it.The senior  and management team were also presented with league and championship medals and the minors were presented with their All County league medals.There were two recipients of the club person of the year award mdash chairperson Sheena Murray in recognition of an outstanding first term in her role and also Gerard Lenaghan in his role as coaching officer and PRO.The final award of the evening was presented to club vice-chairperson and senior player Rory Murphy in recognition of his outstanding contribution over the past  years.Oisin McConville was then invited to say a few words and spoke well with excellent advice for the future and encouraging rank and file members to put their shoulders to the wheel.There is much to do in a growing club and help is vital to sustain the clubrsquos development.

Many from Kilmegan and the surrounding areas tragically paid the ultimate price on a foreign field and are remembered in the book.Chapters on the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, the Troubles, the loyalist and IRA ceasefires and the Good Friday Agreement take the history of the parish into the modern age.Hundreds of hours of painstaking work researching historical documents and the archives of local newspapers, including those of the Down Recorder, were involved in the production of this book which will undoubtedly be regarded as an important point of reference for current and future generations.In a typically noble and generous gesture the Kilmegan and Maghera Historical Group have decided proceeds from the sale of the book will go to the Childrenrsquos Heartbeat Trust.Copies are now on sale at Walkersrsquo newsagents and JRrsquos Discount Stores, Castlewellan, with details of further points of sale on the Grouprsquos Facebook page, Kilmegan Maghera..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Jasmine.jpg","title":"Jasmine\u0027s first Christmas without a home  ","story":"JASMINE Carbery is one of the many unseen homeless people in Northern Ireland.She looks like any other young woman you may notice walking along Market Street in Downpatrick mdash bright, full of le and full of chat.Yet, at the young age of , she will spend Christmas at the Simon Community house in Saul Street away from her family for the first time.She moved into Saul Street in August after staying in the Newry Simon Community hostel a few months before that.Jasmine is one of three young women living in the Saul Street house. So far she is doing well and enjoying her new le in Downpatrick.Jasmine was asked her to leave her home earlier this year. Her parents have not been in her le for some time.ldquoLiving in Downpatrick is alright. Irsquove actually made a few friends outside the hostel which makes me happy, said Jasmine.ldquoThere was a breakdown in the family relationship. I was working but then I needed to have some serious surgery on the back of my neck and I wasnrsquot able to work. Thatrsquos what led to the breakdown and I was asked to leave.What Jasmine says next is said in a calm, non-emotive manner.ldquoBecause I hadnrsquot been working, I didnrsquot have much money to contribute to the house. Also because I have two rare medical conditions, I had been on preion painkillers for them for over a year now. Irsquom actually addicted to them. It was probably another factor in why I was asked to leave.Jasmine was born with whatrsquos known as a Chiari malformation, a condition in which brain tissue extends into the spinal canal as well as Syringomyeli, another condition where a cyst or cavity forms in the spinal canal.Her recent surgery was to correct the growth of her brain into the top of her spine.She adds: ldquoWhile I was living in Craigavon, I was going out with a guy who was a drug dealer but I had never taken drugs before that. When I became homeless, I started taking drugs, mainly cocaine and tablets, as they were all around me.ldquoI suppose itrsquos a bit of an escape as well as many people see homelessness as rock bottom. But the prescription painkiller addiction would be my biggest problem and I suffer really badly with my mental health.Jasmine relationship with her relatives is still fragile, although there has been some infrequent communication between them.Living in a hostel has had some high and low points for her.ldquoSimon Community hostels are used as bail hostels but they are not exclusive to just prisoners, she said. ldquoI have never been in jail, never been arrested and would be classed as a vulnerable person.ldquoYou donrsquot really know who you are living with in a hostel as therersquos all sorts of people. That makes you more apprehensive.ldquoMy experience is that there have been predominantly male residents in the two hostels I have lived in. I was the only girl in about - fellas in the Newry hostelrsquos main building, so that took a bit of getting used to and was quite scary. Here is smaller, so itrsquos not as bad.ldquoBut the staff are amazing here. They go above and beyond their job description for you. They will sit and talk with you, watch the TV with you, play a board game, cook for us, everything we need.Jasmine left school at  with some qualications and has been told she is bright, but she has not been able to complete other educational courses, mostly due to her medical condition.However, she has recently been working with the human rights charity, Participation and the Practice of Rights, to help others know their entitlement in seeking social housing.She is being supported in the hostel for her problems and will be soon working with an Community Addiction worker.Jasmine has some goals for the New Year ahead which she hopes to achieve, again with the support of the Simon Community team.ldquoI would love to get my own place, thatrsquos my number one priority, she said. ldquoI would like not to be taking drugs and I also would like to reconnect with my family and get back into some education..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Lecale.jpg","title":"Lecale and Downe Historical Society launches annual publication  ","story":"THE Lecale and Downe Historical Society launched its th annual journal at the Down County Museum last week.Lecale Review No , has proved to be another excellent mix of compelling articles of local interest, published just in time for Christmas.The latest annual charters the history of one of the oldest racecourses in the world outside Downpatrick.The story penned by Joan Magee, lsquoHorse Racing At the Flying Horsersquo tells how a handful of gentry held a horse race around  but little  is known of the occasion.Within  years, the Earl of Ardglass and other noblemen petitioned King James II to set up a Royal Corporation of Horse Breeders within the county.All its members were to be known as Freemen and it had the power to meet in Downpatrick or some other Co Down town every Tuesday of Easter week.As well as having permission to race, the corporation was also permitted to hold a horse fair too.Joan explains that a race transpired at the Flying Horse, Downpatrick, on March ,  and is especially signicant as this race marked the beginning of what is one of the earliest flat racing courses in the world.The winner was Colonel Byerley, who fought at the Battle of the Boyne four months later against the platersquos donor ndash King James II.Another interesting article written by Colm Rooney charts the history of cinema within Downpatrick.Colm reveals that while Belfast had over two dozen cinemas, Downpatrick finally welcomed its first, the Pavilion Picture Theatre in St Patrickrsquos Avenue, at a glitzy opening ceremony on Wednesday June , .It was a huge event for local entrepreneur, Downpatrick man, William Tweedie who watched as locals queued up to pay over one shilling to see the Prisoner of Zenda, the first movie ever shown in the cinema.The cinema later moved to Market Street in the early s with the Breen family taking over the running of the business around , which ran until the s.Another article, Downpatrick by Gaslight, written by Andy Gilmore, reflects on the journey of natural gas over the centuries in Downpatrick.Andy points out that the use of town gas in Ireland dates back to  when gas for lighting streets and homes began to be produced from coal.However, it wasnrsquot until , and a concerted effort by the townsfolk that led to the foundation of a gas company that brought the energy source to Downpatrick.A site on Market Street was agreed for the gasworks in  and it opened later that year.

To continue with the horse racing analogy, Alliance might just be worth a punt at the bookies this time around.Mr Brown said that most importantly, voting isnrsquot about keeping anyone out and is not about having to choose between two parties you donrsquot really like that much.ldquoFrankly,all a party can offer the electorate is lsquo you donrsquot vote for me, yoursquoll get themrsquo, they shouldnrsquot be running in the first place, he continued.ldquoI am standing for election because Alliance represents the values and ideas I want to see in politics here mdash liberalism, a shared society, environmentalism, human rights, transparency, internationalism and economic justice.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/buil1.jpg","title":"nine storey office scheme for belfast city centre","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew A new proposed nine-storey office building in the heart of Belfast city centre could house up to  workers once completed, Ulster Business can reveal. There are now plans to build the grade A office building at Victoria Street. It would see the current Chancery House building knocked down to make way for the development. In , the building was sold off in excess of its guide price of £.m following a competitive bidding process. Chancery House, which is located on the edge of Belfast’s Law Courts and opposite Victoria Square Shopping Centre, was purchased by a local private developer. The fresh planning application has been made by Chancery House Investments Ltd, which includes Northern Ireland businessman Darren Donnelly as a director. Its being designed by Todd Architects alongside planning consultancy Turley. The building would include more than , sq ft of grade A office space, and those behind it have said it “would assist in addressing an identied need in the marketplace for small office floor plates to primarily serve indigenous businesses which are expanding and want a city centre business location”. It also says the design of the development “has been carefully formulated and responds to the immediate context of the site and its surrounding”. “The proposals improve the setting of the Old Town Hall and define its location with a building which adds vibrancy to this important nodal point”. A design statement says the development could accommodate between - office workers. Speaking at the time of the sale of Chancery House, Neil McShane, director at Lambert Smith Hampton, who the sale process, said: “Chancery House represented a unique opportunity in that it is an income-producing investment property with exciting development prospects. The prime location and secure tenant means that it will continue to perform well as an office investment but,redeveloped, will attract signicant interest from potential occupiers.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff.

The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
