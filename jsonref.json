The Government simply couldn’t believe what it was hearing. If Mrs May’s deal is to be put before the House for a third time, the Speaker ruled citing a Commons precedent from 1604, then it would have to be substantially different to the one MPs voted on last week. She could not simply ask members to vote on exactly the same deal.Bang! An Exocet rocket straight to the core of what remained the Prime Minister’s Brexit strategy. No wonder Bercow was smirking.Chief whip Julian Smith was so stunned his lower jaw was hanging open. Someone on the front bench really needed to lean over and pop it back up again.              It was obvious this was to be no mundane procedural announcementOnce again the Government had been done over by the chair. Frustrating ministers and torpedoeing Brexit. These are what get John Bercow out of bed in the morning. Rules? Procedure? The chap just seems to make ’em up as he goes along.The Speaker had been on unusually boisterous form for a Monday moments before making his statement during Pensions Questions.He bantered with backbenchers. He joshed with his clerks. Plonked in the Speaker’s throne, his stumpy legs hammered up and down his footstool excitedly like a naughty toddler in a highchair.When news emerged he would be making a statement once the session had finished it was swiftly obvious from his giddy behaviour the little goblin planned to drop a howitzer on the Government.The House quickly filled as MPs rushed to hear what he had to say. How he seemed to enjoy that. He then rose to feet, clutching a stack of paper half an inch thick. Oh heck, we weren’t getting out of here in a hurry.       Once again the Government had been done over by the chair. Frustrating ministers and torpedoeing BrexitHere was the Speaker at his despotic worst. Putting himself at the centre of events and turning it into the John Bercow show, painting himself as Parliament’s fearless defender.‘Part of the responsibility of the Speaker is to speak truth to power and I have always done that... I have never been pushed around and I am not going to start now... I am not a stickler for tradition but…’ I, I, I. Me, me, me. His oration became so florid and absurd at one point, works and pensions secretary Amber Rudd had to stifle her matronly giggles. The arch-Brexiteers were delighted. Sir William Cash (Con, Stone in Staffordshire) congratulated the Speaker on his judgment, saying his decision ‘made an awful lot of sense’.Bercow returned the compliment, praising Mr Cash for always trying to act in the national interest. Priti Patel gave a beaming Cash a ‘well done’ pat on the back. Pass the sickbag stuff.Jacob Rees-Mogg (Con, Somerset North) commended the Speaker for following protocol, quoting from the Bible: ‘There is more joy in Heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.’ Bercow grinned and nodded his head enthusiastically. I’m not sure he realised this was a dig.         Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May is seen at Downing Street, in London today Sir Hugo Swire (Con, East Devon) asked not unreasonably why the Speaker had made this call now, and not last week when it was clear Mrs May was going to try again. Tsk. And give the PM the weekend to adjust her preparations? Where would the fun have been in that?Leader of the House and Bercow nemesis Andrea Leadsom briefly punctured his balloon when she coolly implied he couldn’t be trusted to treat colleagues with courtesy and respect. Cue collective sucking of wind around the chamber.‘I treat the House with respect, I treat members with respect!’ The Speaker boomed, jabbing his forefinger at his accuser. Background: Bercow once called feisty Leadsom a ‘stupid woman’. Funnily enough, a caller to Rees-Mogg’s phone-in show on LBC earlier that morning had pre-empted Bercow’s ruling.Samina from Tooting she was called. She had phoned to enquire why Mrs May was being allowed a third crack at her vote, asking: ‘Isn’t this tactic specifically barred to stop the Government from bullying the legislature. Shouldn’t this be ruled out of order?’‘A brilliant question,’ purred the Moggster, referring her to page 397 of the Parliamentary rule book, Erksine May.Samina certainly seemed to know her way around Parliamentary procedure rather better than your average LBC punter, traditionally a forum for London cab drivers and the over-opinionated.

The DfT said it has no immediate plans to legalise electric scooters, and advised retailers to be clear to customers about where they can use them.But Nicholas Lyes, the RAC’s head of roads policy, said: ‘Clearly, much needs to be thought through before electric scooters can be allowed to use UK roads legally.‘The convenience and affordability of electric scooters should not be overlooked, but the vulnerability of riders in a collision is arguably even greater than those on bicycles. Care needs to be taken to ensure the safety of all road users, including pedestrians and cyclists, as new modes of transport gain popularity.’         Departmental minister Jesse Norman claimed Britain was on the verge of a transport revolution. He said the shake-up would have the most profound implications since the advent of affordable motoring in the 1950s. Picture: stockThe review of transport laws is part of the Government’s Future of Mobility: Urban Strategy.Ministers are also launching a competition for up to four new ‘future mobility zones’ which will receive a share of £90million to test ideas to improve journeys.This is expected to include smoother payment systems, more accurate service updates and the use of innovative forms of transport, with the aim of making travel in built-up areas more convenient, reliable and cheaper.Several firms such as Lime and Bird offer scooters for hire in major cities around the world, often in competition with bicycle schemes. They are available in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east London because it is private land and Bird can get around the restrictions imposed on electric scooters.Cheap models can cost less than £200 to buy but high-spec versions are priced as high as £1,800. "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3822891.1552386853!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tastier crisps to cheaper flights how the irish became shorthand for consumer glory","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIt is hard to imagine how low cost flying would have grown so fast without Ryanair.For the weekend that is in it, we thought we’d look at just some of the ways Irish people have shaped the consumer world in which we live.

Video: AccuWeather\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Chicago River as it winds its way through downtown after being dyed green. Photograph: Scott OlsonGetty ImagesIf you suffer from chlorophobia (fear of the colour green), downtown Chicago is not the place to be around St Patrick’s Day. But if you happen to be a chlorophobic unionist, it must be a nightmare.The worst part is the mysterious powder with which the locals famously dye the river every year. It starts out orange, of all colours, before being miraculously transformed on contact with the water. Then, before you can say “Mary Lou McDonald”, the orange turns to a green so intense, especially when the sun shines on it, it’s like the 40 shades combined.Not even the most devout Catholic nationalists in Chicago would claim the river contains holy water. But the formula for the dye, said to be vegetable-based, environmentally friendly, and of a kind once used by plumbers for detecting leaks, is the closely kept secret of two local families, the Rowans and the Butlers, who have been performing this sacrament for more than half a century.So it retains an air of mystery, even though the process is itself an annual spectacle. Three hours before the St Patrick’s parade, two boats take to the river, the first crew distributing “40 pounds” of the magic powder, the second mixing it. It takes a while to achieve the perfect consistency. But the boat crews know their trade, and by the time the marchers pass, the effect is at its height.Toxic substanceBack at the start of the parade this year, meanwhile, there was another colour change – subtle but noticeable – going on. It affected the demeanour of the official Irish delegation, who were left red-faced by the unforeseen addition of a toxic substance called “Conor McGregor” to the guests of honour.McGregor absorbs attention in the US like the Chicago river absorbs powder, so the official VIP Leo Varadkar was badly upstaged. The box-office mismatch aside, the Taoiseach was also forced into uncomfortably proximity with a man who seems ever-more intent on justifying the nickname “Notorious”.At one point, only the Chicago mayor, Rahm Emanuel (who may have had some explaining to do), separated his two guests. Thereafter, the number of buffers grew to something more comfortable.Varadkar was diplomatic about the encounter afterwards. Asked how he felt about McGregor representing Ireland in the parade, he showed deft footwork, worthy of the fighter himself. McGregor was not representing Ireland, he said: “That’s kind of what I was doing.”He was back on safer ground by then, or rather water, as guest of a river boat tour hosted by Tourism Ireland. Having launched the boat, they also launched a book called Ireland’s Greening of the World, marking 10 years of the ingenious national marketing campaign by which multiple global landmarks are colonised by coloured lighting every March 17th, at very little cost.This year the list included everything from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to Dubai’s Burj al Arab. But the piece de resistance, arguably, was the stuff by now under Varadkar, and all around him.Picture yourself in a boat on a river, rendered bright green by a tangerine dye. The effect was psychedelic. With the sun glinting on the water, and off the surrounding skyscrapers (including the local Trump Tower), it was like an Irish-themed LSD trip: Leo in the Sky with Diamonds.An Irish weddingAn experience of a rather earthier kind had awaited the Taoiseach when he was chief guest at the annual Irish Fellowship of Chicago dinner the night before. His speech included a joke about the belated official pardon for Mrs O’Leary’s Cow, long blamed for starting the great fire of Chicago, which Varadkar then developed into a serious point about the scapegoating of immigrants generally.But it was not an occasion for subtlety. Speakers had to shout to be heard by the huge, raucous gathering. Only the priest who gave the pre-dinner invocation was heard in silence. Otherwise it was like the advanced stages of a very large Irish wedding, or wake. Or both. The Taoiseach would have needed a loudhailer to be heard.Long-time observers thought the occasion more suited to the oratorical talents of Michael Ring, who was also part of the visiting delegation. He was not among the speech-makers, but he was certainly in his element. Noting the high numbers of Mayo emigrants present, and in Chicago generally, he was even thinking of a late career change. “If I ran for mayor here, I’d be elected,” he told us afterwards.

Photograph: Parliamentary Recording UnitEPAThe intervention by House of Commons speaker John Bercow on Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement motion came as a “surprise”, the Tánaiste said tonight.Speaking at an Irish Embassy St Patrick’s Day event in Brussels on Monday night, Simon Coveney said Mrs May can still ask for an extension to the Brexit process and the EU can still discuss the issue at a two-day meeting beginning on Thursday“A number of us listening to Westminster today were somewhat surprised that a procedure of the House has been used to potentially prevent a meaningful vote happening before the summit. That’s a matter for Westminster to resolve,” he said.“There was always the potential for the PM to come to an EU summit and seek a longer extension. She made it very clear last week that if she wasn’t able to have a meaningful vote that endorsed the withdrawal agreement she would request a longer extension of article 50.“So that’s what we can expect will happen now on Thursday and Friday.”‘Significant intervention’His comments were echoed by the Irish commissioner Phil Hogan and Irish MEP Mairead McGuinness, although she insisted the British prime minister may have difficulty providing the justification for an extension needed by EU leaders.Meanwhile, Fianna Fáil’s Brexit spokeswoman, Lisa Chambers, portrayed the speaker’s move as a “significant intervention”.“It has increased the possibility of the UK seeking a longer extension of article 50 and the uncertainty that comes with that,” she said.David Cullinane of Sinn Féin said that, in order for that to happen, the British would have to get agreement from the European Union on legal changes to the withdrawal agreement, and he said there was “no chance” of that happening.Referring to Mr Bercow’s invocation of the rule that dates back to 1604, Mr Cullinane said: “A 400-year-old rule, very rarely if ever invoked, has potentially derailed her last chance to get the withdrawal agreement through.”Fine Gael spokesman Senator Neale Richmond said it was an unexpected development. “It’s very interesting but it is another instance of an internal Westminster issue that we cannot impact. The withdrawal agreement cannot be reopened,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

The speaker didn’t alert the government to his statement in advance and Downing Street was clearly nonplussed. Photograph: PA WireThe prospect of a vote this week on Theresa May’s Brexit deal was already receding before Commons speaker John Bercow delivered his dramatic statement to the House on Monday afternoon. Although negotiations with the DUP appeared to be going reasonably well, the prime minister’s efforts to persuade Brexiteers to back her deal seemed to have stalled. Bercow didn’t alert the government to his statement in advance, much less what he was about to say, and Downing Street was clearly nonplussed. Although the speaker said May’s Brexit deal could not be put to a vote if it was substantially the same as the proposition MPs rejected last week, he was imprecise about what might constitute a substantial change. LifelineDowning Street acknowledges that the deal itself cannot be changed and the concessions the prime minister secured in Strasbourg last week were the last the EU will offer. The negotiations with the DUP could offer a lifeline, however, in the form of a promise to put into legislation a promise that if the backstop requires Northern Ireland to adopt new EU regulations the rest of the UK will follow suit. If May attempts to put her deal to a vote next week, the addition of that promise to the DUP could help her to make the case that MPs would not be voting on the same proposition as they did last week.ExtensionSo too could the conditions attached to an extension of Britain’s membership of the EU beyond March 29th. Before Thursday’s EU summit in Brussels, May will write to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to the article 50 deadline. Although all 27 other EU leaders must agree unanimously to an extension, they cannot impose conditions on it. This is because the European Council cannot legislate and because if Britain remains in the EU beyond March 29th, it will enjoy all the rights of a member state. So Britain will volunteer to abide by certain conditions, including staying out of discussions about the future of the EU and the next multi-annual budget and promising not to obstruct EU business.OfficialThen the EU can agree to offer an extension of up to nine months, with EU leaders sketching it out at the summit and making it official in a simplified written procedure next week.If Bercow allows a vote and MPs approve May’s deal next week, Britain can leave the EU as soon as it is ready. If it is staying in the EU for more than a few weeks, Britain will have to hold European Parliament elections towards the end of May. To do so, May’s government will have to set the ball rolling by April 11th, yet another deadline on the long, unpredictable road to Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Video: ParliamentTV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSpeaker of the House of Commons John Bercow said Theresa May must present new wording to her Brexit deal for any third meaningful vote. Photograph:  AFPGetty ImagesPrime minister Theresa May’s Brexit plans were thrown into turmoil on Monday when the speaker of parliament said she could not put her orce deal to a new vote unless it was re-presented in a substantially different form.Speaker John Bercow said the government could not bring forward proposals for a vote that were substantially the same as had already been defeated twice before, in January and last week.According to precedents stretching back to 1604, parliamentary rules say that substantially similar proposals cannot be presented for a vote more than once during the same session of parliament.“This is my conclusion: if the government wishes to bring forward a new proposition that is neither the same, nor substantially the same as that disposed of by the house on the 12th of March, this would be entirely in order,” he said.“This ruling should not be regarded as my last word on the subject,” Mr\u0026nbsp Bercow said. “It is simply meant to indicate the test which the government must meet, in order for me to rule that a third meaningful vote can legitimately be held in this parliamentary session.”‘Constitutional crisis’Robert Buckland, the UK’s solicitor general, said the ruling by Mr Bercow would have “huge reverberations” for the Brexit process.“We are in a major constitutional crisis here,” he told BBC News. “There are ways around this – a prorogation of parliament and a new session. We are talking about hours to March 29th. Frankly we could have done without this.“Now we have this ruling to deal with, it is clearly going to require a lot of very fast but very deep thought in the hours ahead.”The British government is likely to need to win changes to its Brexit deal with the EU in order to be allowed to put it to a further vote in parliament.Asked by an MP\u0026nbsp whether further changes to the deal itself would be needed, Mr Bercow said, “in all likelihood, the answer ... is yes”, adding that a change in opinion would not constitute a change in the deal on offer.“Fundamentally, for something to be different, it has to be by definition, fundamentally different. Not different in terms of wording, but different in terms of substance and this is in the context of a negotiation with others outside the United Kingdom, ” he said.The pound fell to its day’s low against the euro and the dollar.Earlier on Monday it had appeared that Mrs May was winning some support for her Brexit deal, but Mr Bercow’s ruling will leave the prime minister scrambling for options.As it stands, Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29th. But parliament has voted for a delay and Mrs May is expected to seek an extension to that deadline when she meets EU leaders at a summit on Thursday.To add to her problems, Mrs May appeared unlikely to reach agreement this week on her Brexit plans with the Democratic Unionists, whose support is vital if she is to get her EU departure deal through parliament.Mrs May had earlier warned lawmakers that unless they approve her Brexit orce pact, Britain’s exit from the EU could face a long delay which many Brexiteers fear would mean Britain may never leave.After two and a half years of negotiations with the EU, the final outcome remains uncertain – with options including a long delay, exiting with Mrs May’s deal, a disorderly exit without a deal or even another EU membership referendum.Mrs May’s blueprint, an attempt to retain close trading and security ties with the EU while leaving the bloc’s formal political structures, was defeated by 230 votes in parliament on January 15th, and by 149 votes on March 12th.– Reuters,Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

However his strong performance has given hope to Democrats, who have taken control of the House of Representatives. Video: Reuters \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer Texas Congressman and Democratic party presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke: The 46 year old offers the politics of feelings. Photograph: Stephen MaturenAFPThe heavens part. The light shines down. The rise in the oceans begins to slow. The world is once more bathed in the mystical glow of a messiah. Our redemption from Donald Trump is at hand.We have The One again, a New One – another lanky, bookish, handsome man with an attractive young family, a thin résumé, an exotic name, a hip affect, a rock star aura, an enticing smile, a liberal press corps ready to fluff his pillows and a frothing Fox News.Let Elizabeth Warren knock herself out with policy proposals. Let Kamala Harris be the adult in the room. Let Bernie Sanders bellow away.The magical man-boy, Beto O’Rourke, has come back from his 40 days in the desert – vlogging, contemplating, floating in and out of a funk – to share his gifts.He has given us the blessed news: “Man, I’m just born to be in it.” He told Vanity Fair that his words at a Texas campaign stop when he was trying to unseat Ted Cruz were pulled out of him “by some greater force”, musing: “Everything that I said, I was, like, watching myself, being like, How am I saying this stuff? Where is this coming from.”Annie Leibovitz advised Beto to wear a blue button-down shirt for her Vanity Fair cover shoot if he was going to run. And now we can hear, as Hillary Clinton noted sardonically about Barack Obama in 2008, “celestial choirs”.Beto floats above the fray, staying vague on nettlesome issues. The 46 year old offers the politics of feelings.“I don’t have a team counting delegates,” he told Vanity Fair, adding, “It’s probably not the most professional thing you’ve ever heard about this, but I just feel it.”Joe Kennedy built his family’s political myth on good hair, white teeth and glossy star quality. Why shouldn’t Beto?Afterall, during his 2008 campaign, Obama merely went back to Chicago to see Malia perform in The Odyssey. Beto loved the epic so much, he thought about naming his son Odysseus, settling instead for Ulysses.Cult of personalityWandering alone, as Jesus, Barack and Beto did, is part of the hero’s journey defined by Joseph Campbell. Beto loves Joseph Campbell and Star Wars, which was inspired by Campbell’s work.The last One, about the same age when he jumped into national politics precociously aiming to usurp his elders, was also a uniter who went on an odyssey of self-discovery in New York while at Columbia.The last One also sold a cult of personality, offered himself as a symbol of modernity, sparked Oprah’s interest and had a preoccupation with being cool.Indeed, Obama told David Axelrod recently on The Axe Files that Beto reminded him of himself.The One anointing the New One. Joe Biden, pushed aside by Obama in the last election, was understandably irritated.Just as reporters once swooned when Obama made like Jay-Z and brushed imaginary dirt off his shoulder after a tough primary debate in Philly in 2008, reporters were entranced when O’Rourke air-drummed Baba O’Riley by The Who at a Whataburger drive-through after his debate with Cruz.To many, Beto’s appeal is his persona as a quasi-rebellious 1990s suburban teenager, a skateboarding punk rocker who seems to have modelled his campaign logo on the spicy ketchup logo at Whataburger.But others are less charmed. A satirical video on Twitter by skaters mocked “bad-skater Beto” as the kind of middle-school poser who “went to Zumiez and spent $27 on stickers”.‘Psychedelic Warlord’In a new Reuters story, Joseph Menn reveals that while O’Rourke was still a teenager, he was a member of the Cult of the Dead Cow, a stealthy hacking group named after an old Texas slaughterhouse. A kind of Neo-lite, he used the handle “Psychedelic Warlord” looking for free video games. (Socialist alert!)A hacker might be refreshing after a president who refers to Tim Cook as Tim Apple. Still, Menn writes, “it’s unclear whether the United States is ready for a presidential contender who, as a teenager, stole long-distance phone service for his dial-up modem, wrote a murder fantasy in which the narrator drives over children on the street, and mused about a society without money”.The 15th entry in the Democratic race is at the nexus of many tricky issues for a party desperate to oust Inidual 1 from the White House.Is it better to nominate a celebrity like Obama with a slight record that cannot be targeted or someone with established credentials? Should the nominee spring from the far left, the vector brimming with electricity and fight, or is that suicidal in a national election?Can white men jump in, or is this post-#MeToo era the time when Democratic and independent women will demand a woman at the top of the ticket? Will Democratic voters longing for another Obama and the minority voters who strayed from Hillary want an African-American?Can pugilistic progressives stomach a rich kid like Beto at a time when the country is in an eat-the-rich mood? Will they tolerate candidates like Beto and Biden, who speak well of Republicans and have a history of working with them?As the Wall Street Journal reports, O’Rourke tried to please Texas Republican business leaders when he “opposed Obamacare, voted against Nancy Pelosi as the House Democratic leader and called for a raise in the social security eligibility age”.The fever is running high in his party. Will Beto turn out to be born for it or borne away by it?"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/10/TELEMMGLPICT000051671687_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO65TkrT7BriBrd3fK6VEg2oOnP5Tf-6BsL77M1adEXU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sir philip green staff told wear revealing clothes visited","story":"Sir Philip Green in 2014 with models, left to right, Suki Waterhouse, Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Sienna Miller and Naomi Campbell.

However, a partially crushed pen was found within the fuselage.The damage to the pen indicated that it was the probable cause of the control restriction. “The pilot reported that, prior to the incident flight, a pen top had been recovered from the rear cockpit of the aircraft during the pre-flight loose article check but no other articles had been seen.As a result of the incident, the pilot has introduced more rigorous pre- and post-flight inspections of the aircraft for loose articles and only allows pens to be carried if they are securely tied to the pilot’s or student’s flying suit.  Please review our commenting policyReplace tulips with daffodils to avoid gardens being blighted by urban deer, say horticulturalistsBribes, queue jumping and theft: the scale of corruption in healthcare revealedIGCSE exam board denies tests are \u0026#39easier\u0026#39 than GCSEs as they say private school pupils tend to do betterComment: Leave MPs must take responsibility for the horrors of a long Brexit delayBritain is now importing more doctors than it trains, figures show  Comment: Believe me, the Civil Service is trying to sink Brexit.

But stepping away from Jo Malone, the company she created at her kitchen table, proved harder than she thought.The Estée Lauder deal included a “lockout clause”, which meant she was contractually prevented from being\u0026nbsppart of the beauty industry and forced into a five-year exile. Such was\u0026nbspher influence, this meant she wasn’t even allowed to purchase items from a beauty counter in case it appeared to be an endorsement.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.“I missed the industry so much. Believe it or not, it never really felt like a business to me. When I’m creating and working I literally come alive, it’s something that’s in me,” she tells\u0026nbspThe Independent.This might be why those\u0026nbspclose to her\u0026nbspwere not surprised when she told them about her idea to launch a second global fragrance brand.Nearly half of business people ‘miss family when travelling’“My family knew because I’ve been such a nightmare to live with for five years. They knew I had to get back there, it was inevitable.“But some of my friends did tell me: ‘I know you’ve got another business in you Jo but should it be fragrance again?’” she adds.Sometimes in business you know you’ve made a big mistake but you don’t have the money to put it right straight away, so you have to salvage as much as you can and that’s what I did“I still love Jo Malone, of course, even if I don’t identify with it creatively anymore. I’m still proud of it and Estée Lauder has done an incredible job. But Jo Loves doesn’t feel like a business, it’s an extension of who I am,” she says.Being a household name, you might assume building a start-up would have been easier the second time around, but Malone laughs out loud as soon as she hears the question: “I’ve got to be honest with you, the first two years were just excruciating.\u0026nbsp“Now I can say this because we have passed that stage, but I’m not sure I could have told you this at the time, I felt so embarrassed. I’m afraid – and I say this to all the people that are building their businesses today – if success does land on your doorstep on day one, you’re one in a million.”Espresso shot mochi ice cream balls unveiled at Selfridge’sAccording to Malone, she made every mistake possible, from packaging to distribution, when launching her new brand.\u0026nbsp“We were about to launch our capsule collection in Selfridges over Christmas, a fantastic opportunity. We were building the pop-up the night before opening day and I just knew I had made the biggest mistake with the packaging, it just wasn’t right.“Sometimes in business you know you’ve made\u0026nbspa big mistake but you don’t have the money to put it right straight away, so you have to salvage as much as you can, and that’s what I did in the first two years. What I knew was I had a product that could still be global and that’s what drove me.”“During these two years, I just kept thinking, I have to get through the week, the month, Christmas. The thing that motivated me the most were the people working with me and the salaries I was responsible for. At one point when there was not enough coming in, I started doing speaking engagements across the country. I knew these engagements would give me a fee that would guarantee a month’s\u0026nbspsalary.”At the time, Malone operated from a creative studio in west London. Customers from all over the world would have to call and make an appointment to order a candle or a fragrance, buying 10-15 bottles in bulk. She had a thriving little business, but she knew it needed a home.After an 18-month delay, which allowed her to replace the initial red packaging with a more subtle white, she launched with a single shop on Elizabeth Street in London’s Belgravia in 2013 – in the very same space where she started her shopkeeper journey more than 30 years ago.\u0026nbsp“Sometimes life will bring you back to where you started,” she says.Malone’s business philosophy comes from a continual desire to innovate and inspire, which is why her shop was always going to be different.\u0026nbsp“I didn’t want to do another candle store. So I thought of a new way to present everything. It’s about changing the way that the industry looks at cosmetics and fragrance,” she adds.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThe store itself is a delight to the senses the second you step into it. The elegant white design of the shop allows your eyes to relax and the door is always kept closed, enabling customers to be stimulated by the scents in the air – the perfect setting for Malone’s “Fragrance Brasserie Bar”, where customers can try out a complimentary fragrance “tapas” experience.\u0026nbspDuring the experience,\u0026nbspshoppers can start by selecting their desired fragrance to create a palate of scents – similar to a food tasting, but for the nose. Bath cologne is first warmed in a tagine before being presented to you as a cloud of steam\u0026nbspa cleanser is then shaken over ice and strained into a Martini glass. Lastly, lotion is whipped and foamed before being painted onto your skin.\u0026nbspSometimes when you’re on your own and you start your business from your spare room, it can be isolating. I want to inspire the next generation but also tell them that they’re not on on their own“In the same way we all remember our first kiss, I wanted my customers to remember their first experience with my brand. It adds value to the brand with no costs and translates into a sale 97 per cent of the time,” she says.For Malone, perfume is strongly associated with memories. Her bestseller scent Pomelo – a fresh, citrus smell with hints of rose and patchouli, reminiscent of a summer holiday – is now one of 14 fragrances inspired by her own experiences. Other products include bath and body lotions, and candles of course.In 2017, Malone started using a paintbrush as part of the brand’s fragrance tapas\u0026nbspexperience, which inspired her to change how her customers applied scent. Although very few believed in the idea originally, it’s now her flagship product.“Whenever someone says ‘no one is going to use that’\u0026nbspor ‘it’s never going to work’, it always goes into my head. These paintbrushes became my golden ticket, the product that got me all over the world telling creative stories. So, if someone tells you you can’t do it, stick to your guns. Don’t always listen to the voices around you.”Jo Loves was always designed to be a global brand and Malone is planning to open new stores soon, both in the UK and across the Atlantic –\u0026nbspalthough she doesn’t want to discuss the exact locations just yet.Jo Malone launches new collection with Poppy Delevingne“I can see the potential in my business and it’s something I would never take for granted,” she says.For any young entrepreneur starting their business, Malone’s story is an inspiration. Perhaps\u0026nbspbecause she was repeatedly told she would fail, she’s keen to give back to the next generation and tell them that they are not alone.With that in mind, Malone has recently taken part in Secret Leaders – a business podcast that es deep into the stories of top CEOs, their brands and their personal lives.“Sometimes when you’re on your own and you start your business from your spare room, it can be isolating. There’s a lot of self-doubt. I want to inspire the next generation, but also tell them that they’re not on on their own.”“So Secret Leaders is a way to share my story with them – the good the bad and the ugly. Sometimes hearing someone else’s story might inspire you to think differently.”Malone cites\u0026nbsppassion, resilience and respect for the currency of creativity as the three most important values in developing a new brand.\u0026nbspWhen I ask what advice she would give to a young business owner in doubt, she quotes the catchphrase from the movie The Imitation Game,\u0026nbspin which\u0026nbspBenedict Cumberbatch plays British mathematician Alan Turing: “Sometimes it’s the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.”\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

The shares debuted at 164p and rapidly added a pound of weight, before swiftly losing it, and a lot more, in a manner that would have some of its 20 something shoppers going green with envy.\u0026nbspA couple of profit warnings in quick succession will do that to you.JD Sports to buy Footasylum in £90m dealJD Sports weathers high street storm with sales growthThe company blamed tough conditions on the high street and delayed openings for a plunge into the red at the half year stage (£4m loss before tax compared with profit of £2.3m in the previous interims).Another alert followed in a January trading statement.They left the company looking like a mid morning snack for someone like Sports Direct’s Mike Ashley.\u0026nbspCowgill had, however, taken note and a month later was sitting on an 18.7 per cent stake enough to make Ashley’s life difficult should he have taken an interest in between butting heads with the Debenhams board, its lenders, and just about everybody else.\u0026nbspNow JD, which had said it didn’t plan to make an offer not that anyone’s really complaining today, is proposing to buy the rest of the shares for 82.5p, which is\u0026nbspa better result than some of those who bought in before Footasylum\u0026nbsptripped up\u0026nbsphad any right to expect.\u0026nbspThe purchase price is more than 80 per cent above\u0026nbspthe level at which the bombed out shares closed out Friday. It is also a lot higher than the prices (50p to 75p) JD paid to build up its existing stake.According to Edison Research, Cowgill\u0026nbspis paying a multiple of 30 times forecast earnings for the year to February 2019, 16 times the following year’s profits.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Of 80 evidence submissions to its inquiry, close to two-thirds related to ticket abuse.\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspcommittee said it notes the significant progress by enforcement agencies in “bringing a number of secondary resale platforms into line with consumer law following actions by the CMA and the Advertising Standards Authority, as well as changes within the industry itself to limit the resale of tickets for profit”.Woman paid ‘£3,000 on Viagogo to take dying father to BBC Proms’But it called for more action from the government. MPs said in a statement: “We believe that Viagogo has yet to prove itself a trustworthy operator given its history of resisting compliance, court orders and parliamentary scrutiny, and flouting consumer law.“We are concerned that while that work takes place, consumers remain vulnerable to the site’s misleading sales practices. It is imperative that the CMA acts promptly and decisively to bring Viagogo into line with consumer law and, until it does so, we advise the public not to buy or sell tickets via Viagogo.”Committee chairman\u0026nbspDamian Collins\u0026nbspsaid that, despite a “boom in live music” in the UK, it is also facing “stark challenges”, with “bad experiences with ticket resale platforms damaging trust in the industry”.He said: “We’re calling on the government to review the effectiveness of the law intended to prevent consumers being ripped off when buying tickets for live concerts.“The government shouldn’t rely on the work of voluntary groups to take on the giants in the ticket resale market but make sure there is effective action to end exploitation, and greater transparency and redress for ticket buyers when things go wrong.“The DCMS committee has taken today the highly unusual step of issuing a warning to the public against using a major secondary ticketing site until it complies fully with consumer law.”A spokesperson\u0026nbspfor Viagogo said it was disappointed to have been singled out and claimed that it provided an “invaluable service”.“Hundreds of thousands of British citizens use our service to buy and sell tickets to their favourite live events every day and never experience any problems,” the firm said.“For those transactions that fall into the 1 per cent\u0026nbspannually where customers do have an issue, the overwhelming majority of cases are due to the unfair and potentially illegal restrictions the event organisers pose simply because customers have chosen to purchase tickets from a competitor of theirs.“We have been complying and will absolutely continue to work constructively with the CMA to make further amends where necessary, all the while putting all of the buyers and sellers who use the platform first.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Entrances to fields and farms were blocked with disinfected straw members of the public were not allowed to enter them.Humans are usually safe from the disease, but at least one person died from the epidemic some of the worst outbreaks were in Cheshire, Shropshire and Wales.The disease was later reckoned to have been virtually eradicated throughout the European Union after a campaign of vaccination and slaughter. That makes yesterday’s action, in which the EU banned all meat, milk and livestock exports from the UK, understandable.After slaughter, farms had to be scrubbed twice a day with special disinfectant and animals were not allowed on to the land for at least six months. Restricted entry signs stood over the entrance to farmland, bearing warnings including: “You are now entering an infected area.”Horse racing was suspended in Britain after the 1967 outbreak and the official Shrovetide football game in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, was cancelled in 1968 because of continuing restrictions.The outbreak was finally linked to frozen lamb carcasses imported from Argentina.Although Britain did suffer another foot-and-mouth outbreak in 1981 on the Isle of Wight, it was easily isolated. A total of 200 cattle and 369 pigs were destroyed.This article first appeared in The Independent on 22 February 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

In nine days, Scottish farmers and dealers reach the more important deadline when they can apply for a resumption of overseas exports, because then they will have been free of the disease for 90 days.The auction at Kirkwall, capital of the Orkneys six miles off the mainland, was seen as a trial run for the resumption of trade in other unaffected areas of the United Kingdom.Though no more than two dozen buyers, many of them mainland farmers from Aberdeenshire, made the ferry trip for yesterday’s sale, only auction and government veterinary officials, and representatives from the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, were allowed close contact with the livestock. The buyers, dressed from head-to-toe in hats, clean boiler suits, rubber boots and white plastic raincoats, had to forgo the usual close inspections of the cattle before the sale began.For the Orcadians, the resumption of the weekly cattle mart was more than just a lifeline for business. The social effect of the closure has been devastating. Since the beginning of the crisis, movement on the island has been curtailed because friends and neighbours fearful of spreading the disease kept their distance from other farms.Created with Sketch.How the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak brought Britain to a standstill Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Around 150 dead cows that may have come in contact with foot-and-mouth disease are burnt on a funeral pyre at Great Warley Hall farm in Great Warley, Essex, 27 February 2001.

There’s much still to do to get out of the mess that foot-and-mouth has caused and get the farmers back to a kind of normality.”Steven Metcalf, chairman of Orkney Auction Mart, said: “The social effect of the mart reopening is good news. Early in the outbreak people were frightened to move around and weren’t visiting neighbours or friends. It is a good boost for the morale of agriculture and it is a step nearer to normal trading and normal life.”Although the slaughter of more than 800,000 animals north of the border has so far limited the number of confirmed cases to 187, Maria Limonci, spokeswoman for the NFUS, said Scottish farmers needed to see export bans lifted. “Around 40 per cent of the sheep produced in Scotland usually go out of the country and at present they have nowhere to go,” she said. “More farmers deal in sheep than cattle, and this was only one sale. It’s a huge step in the right direction but it doesn’t mean things are now OK.“We have to hope nothing goes wrong in next few days. Having 90 clear days would give Scotland grounds to put forward the proposal to Europe to allow exports to restart.”In England, continuing restrictions prompted 600 farmers yesterday to demand a public inquiry into the handling of the crisis.David Handley, head of the pressure group Farmers For Action who spearheaded last year’s fuel blockade, led a protest march from Hyde Park to Downing Street to hand in a petition condemning the government’s policy on dealing with the crisis and the failure to implement a vaccination strategy to prevent the spread of the disease.Although the turnout was lower than expected, protesters included farmers from foot-and-mouth hotspots in North Yorkshire, Cumbria and Devon and Cornwall.Up to 3,000 civil servants at the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs held a one-day strike on 20 August 2001 over pay inequalities that followed formation of the new departmentThis article first appeared in The Independent on 21 August 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

Oh, give it up!Created with Sketch.The best albums of 2019 (so far) Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 418 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.518 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1318 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1418 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.1718 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in.

Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1318 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1418 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.1718 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.After walking off camera for a moment Daltrey returned and said: If you want to be signed up to be ruled by a f***ing\u0026nbspmafia, you do it. Like being governed by Fifa.In an interview with\u0026nbspThe \u0026nbsplast year\u0026nbspDaltrey\u0026nbspclaimed many people failed to distinguish that he was anti-Brussels, not anti-Europe.\u0026nbspThat\u0027s why I\u0027m so angry about it, he said. I want someone at least answerable to me that I can say: \u0027F*** off, you\u0027re useless!While Daltrey\u0026nbspmay be confident about the impact (or lack of) that Brexit will have on the music industry, a number of prominent industry figures have been airing their concerns over the past year.\u0026nbspWhat will happen to the UK music industry after Brexit?In December 2018, artists including Annie Lennox, Paloma Faith, Pink Floyd\u0027s Nick Mason, Nadine Shah, Billy Bragg and Blur\u0027s Dave Rowntree, plus\u0026nbspmusic companies including Kilimanjaro Live and Beggars Group, and\u0026nbspindustry bodies like AIM, the Musicians Union and the Music Producers Guild, all signed a letter seeking more concessions against Brexit\u0027s potential impact on the industry.\u0026nbspThe letter was drafted by the pro-Europe group Music4EU, and stated: Brexit represents a significant threat to the UK\u0027s music industry. Leaving the EU customs union, single market, VAT area and regulatory framework (in whole or part) could devastate our global market leadership, and damage our freedom to trade, tour and to promote our artists and works.It continued: The music industry contributes £4.5bn to the UK economy, and our world-beating artists helped to create exports of over £2.5bn, which is growing fast in a global digital music business. Live music is at the heart of every artist\u0027s business and contributed around £1bn\u0026nbspto the UK economy, and freedom of movement is core to an artist\u0027s ability to tour and promote their art.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But what, asks\u0026nbspJon Stone, is the reality?Click to followThe IndependentItaly has had its own disagreements with the EU in recent monthsCould the EU veto an Article 50 extension?Theresa May will go to Brussels on Thursday to ask EU leaders for an Article 50 extension. This would have happened irrespective of John Bercow\u0027s dramatic intervention in parliament to start the week.There has been some speculation that the EU could decide not to permit\u0026nbspan extension, either collectively or because some members are not keen.Do inidual EU leaders have the power to veto Britain\u0027s\u0026nbsprequest for more time?Yes – because any extension has to be unanimously agreed by all 27 other EU member states, any one of them dissenting could block it. It has been suggested that Italy might be tempted to pull rank.Created with Sketch.

Could populists like Italy’s Matteo Salvini or Poland’s Law and Justice party block an extension? Some Brexiteers – who don’t want Brexit to be delayed – have asked sympathetic EU leaders to prevent\u0026nbspthe Article 50 period from being extended.Bercow’s Brexit ruling is mistaken, but May’s deal is doomed anywayIn January, Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski formally asked the Polish government to block any delay. This doesn’t appear to have been taken seriously by Poland and no response has been given.More recently, this month leading Brexiteers Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore visited Italy. Shortly after, Mr Wigmore said it was “time for Matteo Salvini to help us and veto an extension”.This led some Remain campaigners to suggest there was a plot afoot to block a delay. Mr Salvini – who is notably Italy’s interior minister, not its prime minister, and so has no personal vote – has had his\u0026nbspown battles with Brussels and is\u0026nbspsuspected to be sympathetic.A far more likely reason for a blockage would be if EU leaders collectively decided it was against the bloc’s interest. They might see value in giving Britain a deadline to concentrate mindsNotably, many Brexiteers themselves don’t appear to believe it\u0026nbspwill happen.“They won\u0027t, there\u0027s no hope of us getting a veto, they\u0027re not going to spend their political capital in the EU on a country that is about to Leave,” Tory MP Jacob Rees Mogg said on LBC radio on Monday.Does anyone else have cause to veto an extension? A far more likely reason for a blockage would be if EU leaders collectively decided it was against the bloc’s interest. They might see value in giving Britain a deadline to concentrate minds. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspEmmanuel Macron has said any extension would have to have a “clear objective” and be based on “a new choice” by the British.Michel Barnier summarised their position\u0026nbsplast week: “Why would we extend these discussions? The discussion on Article 50, that is done and dusted. We have the withdrawal agreement, it is there.

We’ve been speaking about it for seven years.”Facebook has removed 1.5 million videos of New Zealand attackOldham man arrested for Facebook post ‘supporting’ New Zealand attack Mr Mughal accused social media firms of taking a “racialised” approach to extremism and letting the far-right slip through the net.“We’re dealing with lives here and these guys are dealing with profits,” he added. “This is appalling.”Golding also paid for two adverts that ran on Facebook in recent days.Seen by up to 100,000 people, one advert urged viewers to follow Golding’s “official Facebook page”, and the other linked to a Britain First petition.Golding’s two new pages, including one that had been online for more than four months,\u0026nbspwere deleted after The Independent requested comment from Facebook.The internet giant has said it works to remove extremist content of all kinds using human moderators and artificial intelligence. But it has faced renewed calls to increase its efforts following the New Zealand attack.Ben Wallace, the security minister, told MPs the government would shortly be publishing draft laws against “online harm” that will set out clear expectations for internet firms.“Social media platforms should be ashamed that they have enabled a terrorist to livestream this evil massacre and spread this mantra of hate to the whole world,” he added, in response to an urgent question over the New Zealand attack.Britain First supporter who drove van at curry house jailed“Enough is enough. We’ve been clear that tech companies need to act more quickly to remove terrorist content and ultimately prevent new content being made available to users in the first place. This must be a wake-up call for them to do more.”Britain First’s adverts were permitted despite its official Facebook page and those of Golding and co-leader Jayda\u0026nbspFransen being deleted in March last year.The pair had just been jailed for religiously aggravated harassment, and pressure to remove Britain First pages mounted after its posts were linked to the Finsbury Park terror attack,\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspmurder of Jo Cox and a car ramming that targeted Muslims.At the time, a spokesperson for Facebook said the official Britain First page and those of Golding and Fransen had repeatedly broken its community standards.“There are times though when legitimate political speech crosses the line and becomes hate speech designed to stir up hatred against groups in our society,” a statement said.“They have repeatedly posted content designed to incite animosity and hatred against minority groups, which disqualifies the pages from our service.”Britain First styles itself as a “patriotic political party” and is applying to register with the Electoral Commission in Northern Ireland, while candidates campaign for English council seats.Founded in Swanley as a splinter group of the British National Party, members became known for launching so-called Christian patrols and mosque “invasions”, while campaigning against immigration and Islam.Britain First forged links with extreme nationalist movements across Europe, with Fransen attending a march in Poland where she called Islam a “cancer moving through Europe”, adding: “Our children are being bombed, our children are being groomed and our government does nothing.”The Finsbury Park terror attacker, Darren Osborne, read Britain First posts while planning his attempted massacre of Muslim worshippers, while neo-Nazi Thomas Mair repeatedly shouted “Britain first” while murdering Labour MP Ms Cox.The group gained international notoriety after videos posted from Fransen’s Twitter account were retweeted by Donald Trump in 2017, sparking a diplomatic row between Downing Street and the White House.After being released from prison last year, Golding and Fransen focused their activity on Northern Ireland and have been charged with several other offences relating to protests.Fransen announced she had left Britain First to start an “exciting new chapter” in January, and retains a personal Facebook page.A Facebook spokesperson said: “Hate speech of any kind is not allowed on Facebook and Paul Golding’s pages have been removed for violating our policies.\u0026nbspHowever, there is always more we can do to disrupt people wanting to spread hate online which is why we also collaborate with policymakers, civil society, and others in the tech industry, to help us improve the effectiveness of our approach.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

fresh referendum supporters delighted - while minister floats extraordinary plan to suspend parliament and start a new sessionClick to followIndy PoliticsTheresa May’s hopes of forcing MPs to back\u0026nbspher Brexit deal by staging repeat votes are in tatters, after speaker\u0026nbspJohn Bercow dramatically blocked the tactic, citing rules dating back to before the Gunpowder Plot.The prime minister was left stunned by the shock announcement – which torpedoed her hopes of a third “meaningful vote” while threatening MPs with a long delay to leaving the EU if they refused to give way.The dramatic twist, outlawing fresh votes without substantial changes, left ministers scrabbling for solutions – including an extraordinary proposal to suspend parliament and start a new session.It also achieved the remarkable feat of uniting supporters of a no-deal Brexit and a second referendum, who both believed it made their favoured option more likely.The solicitor general, who warned of “a constitutional crisis”, put forward the escape route of ending the current parliamentary session early to get around the 1604 convention invoked by the speaker, which lapses after a fresh Queen’s Speech.Here’s how Theresa May can get around Bercow’s dramatic Brexit ruling“There are ways around this – a prorogation of parliament and a new session,” said Robert Buckland.Created with

12-day session to pass legislation to reduce the power\u0026nbspof the House of Lords.No 10 is also mulling a possible vote to overturn the speaker’s ruling – but this seemed only likely to succeed if there are enough supporters of the deal in the first place.There was no immediate official response from Downing Street, other than to express its fury that Mr Bercow gave no warning of his bombshell announcement, made in the Commons chamber.The speaker said a further meaningful vote\u0026nbspwould be ruled out of order if the motion was “the same or substantially the same” – under a 1604 convention to stop the government bullying parliament on issues MPs have rejected.Ms May has already admitted that the negotiations with the EU are over, making it hard for her to argue that a further meaningful vote will be on a different question.Crucially, the speaker suggested something would have to be renegotiated with the EU to constitute a “change”, rather than, for example, a clarification of legal advice by the attorney general.Is Matteo Salvini going to veto a Brexit extension?French EU minister names cat ‘Brexit’ because of its indecisive natureMr Bercow told MPs: “What the government cannot legitimately do is resubmit to the house the same proposition – or substantially the same proposition – as that of last week, which was rejected by 149 votes.”The Independent revealed in January that pro-EU MPs believed that Ms May’s tactic to bludgeon her deal through, despite heavy defeats, was barred by parliamentary rules.Senior Tories were livid, believing the speaker had once again laid bare his anti-Brexit bias while twisting constitutional rules to suit his purpose.Rory Stewart, the prisons minister, taunted Mr Bercow by tweeting: “‘When I use a word,’\u0026nbspHumpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, ‘it means just what I choose it to mean.’”He added: “In the normal course of events, as the speaker says, parliament says no, and the issue is dropped.“But in this case, this is not an option, because these votes respond to an instruction in a referendum, endorsed by parliament, which rules out dropping back to the status quo.”Supporters of a Final Say referendum were delighted, with former Tory MP Anna Soubry telling\u0026nbspThe Independent: “It puts a second referendum very firmly at the top of the agenda –\u0026nbspit must do. We need a way out of this and this is the only way out.”Guto Bebb, a former Tory minister and People’s Vote supporter, said: “It is inconceivable now for ministers to carry on trying to force this broken Brexit deal on the people of the United Kingdom.”And David Lammy, a Labour supporter of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain group, said: “If the prime minister wants us to vote on her deal again, she should add an amendment allowing for her deal to be put to the people.”In the short term, the speaker’s intervention killed off any prospect of a third meaningful vote this week – already in doubt as the Democratic Unionist Party failed to switch sides.It appears certain that Ms May will have to ask EU leaders for a long\u0026nbspextension – anything between nine\u0026nbspand 21 months – to the Article 50 process at a summit in Brussels on Thursday.The new departure date will then be put to a “take-it-or-leave-it vote” in the Commons and Lords next week, just days before the 29 March Brexit day.For that reason, it increases the chances of a crash-out Brexit, which the Treasury has predicted could\u0026nbsptrigger a near 10 per cent GDP decline.However, a long extension could also open up the space for a further referendum, which some believe the prime minister might yet embrace if it is the only hope of passing her agreement.Speaking to a silent Commons, Mr Bercow said repeat votes had been blocked on 12 occasions up until 1920 – a situation only not repeated since because of “general compliance”.“This convention is very strong and longstanding, dating back to 2 April 1604,” the speaker said.“It’s a necessary rule to ensure the sensible use of house time and the proper respect for the decision which it takes.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Of 80 evidence submissions to its inquiry, close to two-thirds related to ticket abuse.\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspcommittee said it notes the significant progress by enforcement agencies in “bringing a number of secondary resale platforms into line with consumer law following actions by the CMA and the Advertising Standards Authority, as well as changes within the industry itself to limit the resale of tickets for profit”.Woman paid ‘£3,000 on Viagogo to take dying father to BBC Proms’But it called for more action from the government. MPs said in a statement: “We believe that Viagogo has yet to prove itself a trustworthy operator given its history of resisting compliance, court orders and parliamentary scrutiny, and flouting consumer law.“We are concerned that while that work takes place, consumers remain vulnerable to the site’s misleading sales practices. It is imperative that the CMA acts promptly and decisively to bring Viagogo into line with consumer law and, until it does so, we advise the public not to buy or sell tickets via Viagogo.”Committee chairman\u0026nbspDamian Collins\u0026nbspsaid that, despite a “boom in live music” in the UK, it is also facing “stark challenges”, with “bad experiences with ticket resale platforms damaging trust in the industry”.He said: “We’re calling on the government to review the effectiveness of the law intended to prevent consumers being ripped off when buying tickets for live concerts.“The government shouldn’t rely on the work of voluntary groups to take on the giants in the ticket resale market but make sure there is effective action to end exploitation, and greater transparency and redress for ticket buyers when things go wrong.“The DCMS committee has taken today the highly unusual step of issuing a warning to the public against using a major secondary ticketing site until it complies fully with consumer law.”A spokesperson\u0026nbspfor Viagogo said it was disappointed to have been singled out and claimed that it provided an “invaluable service”.“Hundreds of thousands of British citizens use our service to buy and sell tickets to their favourite live events every day and never experience any problems,” the firm said.“For those transactions that fall into the 1 per cent\u0026nbspannually where customers do have an issue, the overwhelming majority of cases are due to the unfair and potentially illegal restrictions the event organisers pose simply because customers have chosen to purchase tickets from a competitor of theirs.“We have been complying and will absolutely continue to work constructively with the CMA to make further amends where necessary, all the while putting all of the buyers and sellers who use the platform first.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

This led other cities across Japan, including Tokyo and Osaka, to develop tactile paving in the following years.Seiichi Miyake\u0026nbspinvented tactile paving, also known as tenji blocksHowever, it was not until the 1990s that Miyake’s invention became commonplace in western countries such as the UK, US and Canada.The most common types of tactile paving include raised lines or domes. The former design indicates that it is safe to walk on a particular path, while the latter acts as a ‘stop’ sign to alert users to potential dangers.Created with Sketch.

The Kumbh Mela is a series of ritual baths by Hindu sadhus, or holy men, and other pilgrims at Sangam that dates back to at least medieval times. Pilgrims bathe in the river believing it cleanses them of their sins and ends their process of reincarnation.

One man is seen kicking the boy while he is on the ground. On Sunday, the prime minister Scott Morrison told reporters: “The full force of the law should be applied to Senator Anning.” Victoria Police has said it is investigating the actions of the senator and his supporters as well as those of the teenager.One of those who tackled the boy was far-right activist Neil Erikson, who was controlling access to the building. During the scuffle to apprehend the boy, he shouted for reporters to be removed from the area. “Get the journalists out of here ... If you don’t like, get out,” Erikson said, according to The Sun-Herald newspaper. While the child was being held in a chokehold, one of Mr Anning’s supporters is heard telling him: “You are nothing but a weak human f***ing being, you f***ing prick.”New Zealand attacker’s gun club was reported to police, man claimsDeath toll from New Zealand terror attacks rises to 50Egg a day may increase heart attack risk, study saysThe teenager has won considerable support for egging the far-right senator. A crowd-funding page set up to help pay for any legal fees he may face has raised almost 30,000 Australian dollars (£16,000). The page initially said: “Money raised will go to EggBoi for: Legal fees. More eggs.”But it was later updated to say the 17-year-old “is committed to sending a majority of the money to the victims of the Christchurch terrorist attack.”In a video posted after the egging incident the boy urged people not to follow his example. “Don’t egg politicians. You get tackled by 30 bogans at the same time,” he said in the video, using Australian slang for an unsophisticated person. “I learnt the hard way,” he added. Mr Anning caused outrage after the attack in which 50 Muslims were killed in two mosques, with a statement calling Islam “the religious equivalent of fascism”.He said: “The real cause of bloodshed on New Zealand streets today is the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place.“Let us be clear, while Muslims may have been the victims today, usually they are the perpetrators. World-wide, Muslims are killing people in the name of their faith on an industrial scale.”He added: “The truth is that Islam is not like any other faith. It is the religious equivalent of fascism. And just because the followers of this savage belief were not the killers in this instance, does not make them blameless.”A Change.org petition to remove him from parliament has accrued almost a million signatures and has made it the biggest and fastest-growing petition ever hosted on the platform.

The Kumbh Mela is a series of ritual baths by Hindu sadhus, or holy men, and other pilgrims at Sangam that dates back to at least medieval times. Pilgrims bathe in the river believing it cleanses them of their sins and ends their process of reincarnation.

And this week will\u0026nbspsee a possible third rejection of Theresa May’s Brexit deal by the House of Commons.“He wakes me up every morning meowing to death because he wants to go out, and then when I open the door he stays put, undecided, and then glares at me when I put him out,” Ms Loiseau\u0026nbspsaid.Ms Loiseau is set to be the top candidate for Emmanuel Macron’s party in the upcoming European Parliament elections, where she will go head-to-head with Marine Le Pen, who is hoping to lead a far-right insurgency.France would block Brexit delay ‘without clear objective’, Macron saysThe minister has taken a tough and sometimes provocative line in Brexit negotiations so far, proactively shooting down UK proposals and warning of the risks of a no-deal Brexit.In October she controversially suggested that a no-deal Brexit would be better than Theresa May’s Chequers proposals for the EU, taunting the prime minister\u0026nbspher own phrase: “No deal would be better than a bad deal”.Her approach has echoed the tone set by her president Emmanuel Macron, who has warned he could block an Article 50 extension if the UK does not come up with new choices to justify it.The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has taken a minister tone, asking: “Why would we extend these discussions? The discussion on Article 50, that is done and dusted. We have the withdrawal agreement, it is there. That is the question asked and we are waiting for the answer to that.”Created with Sketch.

I got my two best friends to record me reading a scene from the movie and we stupidly decided to do it after a bottle of wine for Dutch courage.When I sent my audition tapes through I sounded more Irish than American and I missed out on a potentially huge role.I just wish I had put my mind to it more, but I didn’t really have an interest in acting back then.Kelly Rohrbach got the lead and looked amazing in it. The film wasn’t actually that great . . . but it would have been pretty cool to work alongside Zac Efron and The Rock.SET the controls for the best day of my childhood – Saturday July , , a glorious day of sunshine and showers when England won the FIFA World Cup Final against West Germany.Every second of it is etched in my mind – Nobby dancing, Bobby Moore’s golden aura and Kenneth Wolstenholme’s commentary.“There are people on the pitch – they think it’s all over – it is now!”It was a day to make you believe in magic.I watched it, aged , with my mum – my dad worked every weekend – and I squeaked “F***” when the Germans equalised to make it - at the end of normal time.It was the only time in my le that I ever said “F***” in front of my mum.She forgave me immediately “as it’s the Germans,” she said, the Blitz still fresh in her memory after  years – and went to put the kettle on as we settled down for extra time.It was a day of excitement, pride, patriotism, passion and pure, undiluted drama.WHEN I was a kid I wanted to be an astronautand also an RAF fighter pilot.I was lucky enough to be taken up in a Phantom jet in September , when I helped launch the annual air show at RAF Leuchars, in Fe.Awesome is an overused word, but not in this case.I was given training, poured into a G-suit and for the next hour I had the thrill ride of a letime.Obviously I did nothing but sit there enthralled while not touching any important buttons.We pulled three Gs, which was a bit like being cuddled by a gorilla, but women withstand G-Force better than men and, unlike Jeremy Clarkson, I managed not to throw up.At one point I was upside down and flying so fast I felt I had left my body behind.I wish I could go back in time to relive that moment again and again.I HAVE done a lot of really stupid things – often on purpose. When I told my mum I was leaving college to join a band she told me not to be stupid. But that actually worked out OK.For sure I’ve taken plenty of bad advice over the years and committed countless, colossal clangers.If I could go back in time I absolutely would but not to sort out any of my messes.I’d like to make something that was totally brilliant even more mind-blowingly brilliant than it was to start with.It would be to the summer of . I’d just got my new racing bike. That bike was my first true taste of freedom.I spent the whole summer tearing all over Dorset with my two best friends.I’m not sure anyone ever felt quite as free in the moment as that -year-old boy racing a new bike down a massive hill as fast as possible in the sunshine.There’s no way I’d let my kids do it now. Far too many cars on the road. But I can remember exactly how it felt, clear as anything. Woo-hoo.I WOULD go back to the autumn of , when I was living in New York.My flatmate was in real estate and he had got wind of an apartment building, jointly owned by the residents, that had gone bankrupt.He said you could now buy two-bedroom apartments in this building for as little as ,. It was a risk, sinceit didn’t come out of bankruptcy I’d lose everything.But the upside was thatit came out of bankruptcy, the flat would immediately multiply in value. He was going to buy one. Did I want to buy the one next door I owned a flat in London and could have drawn down on my mortgage to borrow the money.I ummed and ahhed about it and, eventually, chickened out. You can probably guess the rest.My flatmate bought an apartment for ,, the building’s finances were restored and it’s now worth .million.I would like nothing more than to use a time machine to buy the flat next door. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Starting over is just not an option — andNo Deal is unpalatable toMPs, then the obvious solution is to support leaving with a deal.Secondly, a y delay puts us in the awkward position of having to stand candidates for the European Parliament election.This would be a humiliation and the public would be right to be furious.Worse still, as part of an offer for a long extension, the EU may require us to hold a second referendum.Thirdly, we came dangerously close to a backbencher coup — where those who did not win the right to govern wish to take over the role of government, in an extra-ordinarily unconstitutional move that would overturn years of parliamentary conventions with the sole aim of stopping Brexit.Make no mistake, their motives were not to deliver a dferent Brexit or to honour the result of the referendum — it would be to stop Brexit in its tracks. All the while, our hard-working voters and our long-suffering businesses just want to get on with le beyond Brexit.In a survey by market researchers Survation, the majority of Conservative voters said they would take Theresa May’s deal over every other option — No Deal, a long delay or another referendum.There is, however, an obvious solution to all this — and every parliamentarian can choose to take it.I spend my days at the legislative coalface as Leader of the House of Commons. I know what we need to get done to leave the EU in a smooth fashion — and I also know that we do not need is a y extension.While the negotiators have been hard at it in Brussels, I’ve been preparing for and delivering the legislative changes needed for Brexit to make sure our laws work when we leave.So I know thatwe get this deal passed next week, we can deliver Brexit quickly — and potentially much faster than the end of June.If both Houses — the Lords and the Commons — acknowledge the country’s desire to get this settled, we can crack on with passing the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.A short extension to get the legislation finalised is far better than a long one — which would come with unacceptable conditions we have no control over.In setting out the parliamentary timetable, I will, as I always do, fully respect Parliament’s desire to scrutinise and debate.But I will also be looking to move quickly, so Parliament can turn its attention to the wealth of opportunity that awaits us when we leave the EU.As I said at the dispatch box this week, this is an important time for Parliament and there have been dficult decisions to make.With such strongly held views across the House, it’s vital that we continue to listen to each other with respect and understanding.Over the centuries, the country has looked on as Parliament has faced historic decisions.Even in the most challenging of times, we have pulled together and put our duty above all .So I hope the House will now find a consensus that delivers on the will of the people to leave the EU as close to March  as possible.We can then, finally, turn our eyes to the bright future ahead of us and seek to reinstate confidence in British politics.Let’s do our duty — and do our country proud.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We all stand united as brothers and sisters”.Her defiant words are a fitting epitaph for the New Zealand victims: “We must tell them you will not win.”ENOUGH is enough on the Brexit shambles. We want out as soon as possible.A poll today shows that  per cent want PM Theresa May to ignore MPs and leave the EU without a deal.Buther exit plan does not get past Parliament, Britain’s departure could be postponed for two years. As Andrea Leadsom says, a y delay would be humiliating.MPs must unite behind the deal on the table — or waste the chance of a letime to wave goodbye to Brussels.Sort it. Anything  is a betrayal.TRAGIC Jade Goody’s most worthwhile legacy is sadly being squandered.The -year-old’s death from cervical cancer ten years ago was a wake-up call for millions of women. But the smear test rates that shot up after she lost her le have now plummeted to record lows.Backed by this newspaper, the NHS is urging women to take the le-saving test.So our message is don’t delay, go today.

The whole process they’re doing is running down the clock.“I think that point a confidence motion will be appropriate. I think at that point we should say there has to be a general election.”Tory MP Sir Christopher Chope last week told the Commons he could go for the nuclear option and back a no confidence motion to kill off the deal.He branded the Brexit delay an “act of national humiliation” and said he would “seriously consider” backing a no confidence vote in the PM.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It would be an Establishment stitch-up, with serious consequences for the public’s faith in democracy for decades to come.For those Labour supporters who voted to leave, it’s a reminder that the party’s MPs are desperate to overturn the result of the ‘People’s Vote’ in June .There are some notable exceptions. But the vast majority are determined to frustrate Brexit, regardless of the result of our biggest ever democratic exercise.Labour is now far more interested in north London than the north of England.The threat of Remainers wrecking our departure gets more pressing by the day.Brexiteers must accept reality and back the best Brexit possible: the PM’s deal.MIKE Thalassitis’ suicide is a wake-up call for Britain’s TV companies — and the country at large.Suicide is the single biggest killer of men under  in the UK.

It just keeps going on and on, of course, because of not knowing what happened and it is the not knowing which has always been the worst part about it.Sometimes it seems an eternity and other times it just seems as though it wasnt very long ago at all.March  - Miss Lawrence speaks with her parents over the phone and, at .pm, sends her friend a text. She has not been seen or heard from since.March  - Miss Lawrences father, Peter, contacts North Yorkshire Police after his daughter fails to keep an arrangement to meet a friend at the Nags Head pub. She also fails to attend work.March  - Mr Lawrence describes his daughters disappearance as a living nightmare during a news conference in York.April  - Detectives say that Miss Lawrences disappearance is being treated as a suspected murder investigation. A £, reward is offered for information that could lead to the conviction of those responsible.May  - Mr Lawrence calls for an urgent independent inquiry into the police investigation of his daughters disappearance and suspected murder.July  - Police confirm they are reducing the number of officers dedicated to the inquiry into Miss Lawrences disappearance.October  - A new forensic search of Miss Lawrences home is announced as police launch a fresh review of the case.March  - Five years on from Miss Lawrences disappearance, officers discover at her home the fingerprints of people who have still not come forward to the investigation.May  - A -year-old man is arrested on suspicion of murder. He is released on police bail and eventually released without charge on November  .March  - A man in his s is arrested on suspicion of murdering Miss Lawrence and is released on police bail the following day.April  - Three more men, all in their s and from the York area, are arrested on suspicion of murder and are released on bail.September  - A file of evidence on four men arrested on suspicion of murder is sent by North Yorkshire Police to the Crown Prosecution serviceso it can consider whether to bring charges.March  - Police say the CPS has decided the four men will not face charges.January  - Mr Lawrence says he is hugely depressed and disappointed as the investigation into his daughters disappearance is scaled down.March - Nearly a decade on from her disappearance, Miss Lawrence has still not been found. Her father says its very dficult to conceive of her still being alive."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000476867864.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"aldi monster claw crisp packet one snack","story":"Jade Amy had been making her sons packed lunch when she picked up the bag of Monster Claws and realised it felt light.But the -year-old was stunned when she opened the pack of own brand snacks and found just one solitary claw inside.Her hilarious reaction was caught on camera as she furiously asked: They taking the p**s Jade, who bought the crisps from the store in Baguley, Manchester, on March , said: I was grabbing my toddler a bag and as I picked the packet up it didn’t feel right this is why I recorded it.“I laughed with shock.

One of Barto’s victims was just two weeks old when he assaulted her.Lee Ann Berkebile, , was one of the two girls involved in the  case, having been molested by the doctor when she was four.Speaking of her relief at Bartos upcoming sentence, she told The Associated Press: After -some years, I’m just glad it’s finally over, and he can’t do it again. He’s a real sicko. He just makes me really disgusted.Barto appeared before the Pennsylvania Board of Medicine, accused of molesting two girls in the s, back in .The board dismissed the case against him at the time by a - vote, describing the allegations against him as incongruous to his reputation,” reports The State.Barto received mass support from the local community in the wake of the allegations, with hundreds of people attending a rally held at a local restaurant in which he denied the accusations.After getting his medical licence back, Barto went on to molest at least a dozen more victims until his arrest in January .In a letter to parents addressing the allegations against Barto, Laurel Pediatrics said: “Please know that, while this is a very dficult time for all of us, our first priority remains ensuring that your family continues to receive the very best care.We ask that you continue to reassure your children that our doctors and staff are here to take care of them whenever they need us.”The Pennsylvania Department of State, which provides legal and administrative support to the board and prosecutes administrative cases of doctor misconduct, said last year that the Board of Medicine takes allegations of sexual misconduct by professional licensees very seriously.Regulators have not commented on the boards  decision.The attorney general’s office is asking for  to  years in prison."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000476674908.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sheep semen stored 50 years impregnates 34","story":"Samples were taken from four rams back in , and still worked just fine, despite reportedly being the world’s oldest frozen semen.Australian researchers defrosted the samples, taken by scientists from the University of Sydney.They inseminated  Merino ewes – and  became pregnant.The  per cent success rate was higher than that of sperm frozen for only a year - which impregnated  per cent of inseminated ewes.The team said that their research revealed there was “no dference between sperm frozen for  years and sperm frozen for a year”.University of Sydney associate professor Simon de Graaf said: “This demonstrates the clear viability of long-term frozen storage of semen.”“The results show that fertility is maintained despite  years of frozen storage in liquid nitrogen.”The semen had been stored as pellets in vats of liquid nitrogen below -C.The lambs appear to display the body wrinkle that was common in Merinos in the middle of last century, a feature originally selected to maximise skin surface area and wool yields.This characteristic had been largely bred out of Merinos, because it made shearing harder and increased the chance of fly strike.Because the new offspring are from old-stock, it will allow the researcher to compare whether the old characteristics were beneficial or not.The success will bolster hopes that plunging eggs and sperm into the deep freeze is a credible long-term way of providing endangered species with a leline.The original semen samples were donated in the s from sheep owned by the Walker family of Yass Plains."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000475949346.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ally ross on all star musicals","story":"John Barrowman had flagged it up at the previous week’s skating final.“If you like Dancing On Ice, you’ll love.Andyou don’t . . .Nothing could still probably prepare you for what went down, over two hours, at the London Palladium.A show that, much like Popstar To Operastar, Soapstar Superstar and X Factor: Battle Of The Stars before it, took seven minor celebrities out of their sacred “comfort zone” and allowed them to murder some of your favourite West End standards.This being an ITV show, there was also a theatre audience vote and a  of mealy mouthed, over-scoring judges, Strictly’s Kevin Clton, Trevor Dion Nicholas, from Aladdin, Elaine Paige, with the death gurgle laugh, and a new one on me called Kristin Chenoweth, who is unusual in that she not only sounds like a helium balloon but looks a bit like one as well.Host for the night was Barrowman, whose every link carried a fairly hefty threat: “Still to come, Alan Titchmarsh reveals his romantic side.”Before we came to that pretty pass, however, there was an unfolding catalogue of other singing horrors.Tessa Peake-Jones hit the bottle during her Mamma Mia routine, Joel Dommett took an eternity to beat the le out of The Nicest Kids In Town, from Hairspray, and Emmerdale’s Amy Walsh said there would be “expectations”, about her Fanny Brice number, because she’s the sister of Girls Aloud’s Kimberley Walsh.There would indeed, Amy.Clear the building.

But he ended up doing Any Dream Will Do, from Joseph, and oh-my-s**tting dachshund he was bad. Talking point of the night, evenCorrie’s Daniel Brocklebank won, was Alan Titch-marsh singing Some Enchanted Evening, from South Pacic, on a stretch of thoughtfully placed decking.A man overcome with emotion. The main one being anger by the look on his face.Like next door’s kids had just punted their football straight into his prize begonias, it was.The audience went nuts for it, though, the judges were in floods of overwhelmed tears and, must admit, even I was aware I was watching something that would be played again and again, for both good and bad reasons.But I must urge caution here. Antony Cotton got his own ITV chat show after winning Soapstar Superstar.It just needed Simon Cowell tuning in on Sunday, and, before you know it, he’s got Titchmarsh back in the white blazer trying to Dream The Impossible Dream for the Christmas No.Still, we have to look for the positives, and what I’ll ultimately take from All Star Musicals is the fact John Barrowman appeared on telly, for two entire hours, and didn’t shout: “FAB-U-LOUS!” once.Progress. FRIDAY.

expected to be between nine and  months.If the Commons does pass her deal in the coming weeks then the UK can then leave swtly afterwards and not see out the full Article  extension.The date of the next elections to the European Parliament, May , is seen by No as a crucial milepost.If Mrs May’s Brexit deal isn’t passed by that time, then Britain will have to elect MEPs for a full five years, and Remainers in Parliament will be able to keep enforcing extensions to the Brexit delay right up until .Seething ministers accused Mr Bercow of trying to sabotage Mrs May’s plans by conspiring with rebels to enforce a softer Brexit.A Government source said: “It seems clear that the Speaker’s motive here is to rule out a Meaningful Vote this week, which also stands in the way of securing a shorter extension.“It leads you to believe what he really wants is a longer extension, where Parliament will take over the process and force a softer form of Brexit.“But anyone who thinks that this makes no deal more likely is mistaken — the Speaker wouldn’t have done itit did.”The Speaker cited convention dating back to  as he defended his bombshell move – in an unexpected statement to stunned MPs at .pm.Amid a tense silence, the Speaker said that aware of rumours of the PM’s deal could come back a third time he wanted to let the House know his thoughts.And he said that the Government could not in his view bring forward a deal that “is neither the same nor substantially the same” as the one crushed by  votes last week.He insisted the convention dated back to the th century and had been confirmed again many times – including , , ,  and .But he was immediately accused of rank hypocrisy given that he had torn up the rule book just two months ago when allowing Tory ‘Remainer’Dominic Grieve to amend a Government motion on Brexit.At the time, the Speaker said: “I am not in the business of invoking precedent.”Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke stormed: “The Speaker has just tried to kill Brexit.“He knows without Meaningful Vote again Article  will be extended as per the vote in the House on Thursday.”Neil O’Brien, a Tory MP and former aide to the PM, told The Sun: “The Commons wants to decide how to honour the referendum result.“If one of the main options is taken off the table by one man deciding for himself, then my constituents will be absolutely furious.”Prisons Minister Rory Stewart appeared to compare the Speaker to Humpty Dumpty.In a tweet he said: “He tweeted: “When I use a word, Humpty Dumpty said, in a rather scornful tone, “It means just what I chose it to mean.”Tories immediately demanded whether the Speaker would also rule out ‘repeat’ Brexit amendments – such as calls for a People’s Vote or the ‘Cooper-Boles’ push for Parliament to take control of Brexit.The Speaker said he would take a judgement on each at the time.He insisted he allowed Theresa May’s second stab at a Meaningful Vote last week as there had been meaningful change to the proposed deal in the form of new ‘legally binding’ agreement with the EU.And he signalled that “in all likelihood” such a change would again be needed – setting a high threshold for the PM to reach.Amid furious exchanges he further incensed the Government by appearing to mock Commons leader Andrea Leadsom by snarling at her for using her phone during the debate.The one-time Tory leadership contender hit back by accusing him of failing to show “courtesy and respect”.While dismaying No., Mr Bercow’s verdict was met with jubilation by hardline Brexiteers bitterly opposed to the PM’s deal – and keen to push for a ‘No Deal’ exit on March .One source said a group of Eurosceptic Tories were whistling the theme tune to ‘The Great Escape’ in the Westminster tea room.Veteran Bill Cash stood up and praised the Speaker – saying the decision “seems to make an enormous amount of sense”.Meanwhile ‘Remainers’ in Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP pushing for a People’s Vote lavished praise on the Speaker.SNP’s Pete Wishart tweeted: “Devastating.”Labour’s Chris Bryant – one of a number who called on the Speaker to rule on a third vote last week – said the intervention meant the Government had to stop “faffing about”.He said: “We can’t keep on going round and round in ever decreasing circles. If she really has a new plane we can look at it.Constitutional experts said the PM could now take the nuclear option of winding up Parliament altogether – a process known as “prorogation”.It could ‘re-start’ with the Queen’s backing and put the Meaningful Vote back before the Commons with a clean slate.Solicitor General Robert Buckland admitted the Government would find a way around his order and press on with another Meaningful Vote on MrsMay’s deal anyway, evenit meant closing down Parliament for a day and beginning a brand new session.Mr Buckland said: “We are in a major constitutional crisis here that we want to try and solve for the country.“I simply ask the question, what can Parliament do to end the uncertainty ”The senior law officer added: “There are ways around this - a prorogation of Parliament and a new session. We are talking about hours to March . Frankly we could have done without this.“Now we have this ruling to deal with, it is clearly going to require a lot of very fast but very deep thought in the hours ahead.”Academics also said the Speaker had got his ruling wrong.Emminent lawyer Sir Stephen Laws QC, a senior fellow at the Policy Exchange think-tank, added: “If there is a majority for the deal, preventing the vote would be to frustrate the will of the House.It would be deeply concerning to see a Speaker act in such a way.But independent MP Frank Field said he believed odds of Government taking the nuclear option were tumbling by the minute.“I think it means we’ll be entering the next session of Parliament rather quickly. They can bring this Parliament to a close and start a new session with a Queen’s Speech after Easter.“The Speaker can’t stop the Government doing that … yet!”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I under­stand these talks were broadly positive. One Cabinet minister close to the process tells me the chances of the DUP backing the deal are, “a bit better than :. I’d put it at :”.What is winning round the DUP is the promise of putting into the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which puts the deal into UK law, a requirement that there be no ergence between Northern Ireland and Britain.The Withdrawal Agreement Bill would be so-called superior legislation. This would mean it would trump any other bill, giving the DUP some reassurance that the next Prime Minister couldn’t let regulatory dferences emerge between the rest of the UK and Northern Ireland.Parliament will also be given a scrutiny power over the backstop, allowing it to vote every few years on how it is operating.At the same time, the UK Government will seek to offer the DUP some reassurance about this country’s ability to get out of the backstop. I am told thatAttorney General Geoffrey Cox’s legal advice had been dferent, then the DUP would have been on board this week. One Cabinet minister tells me:“Geoffrey did cost the DUP.”To sweeten the deal for the DUP, there will be money and ladles of respect. The DUP want a new “policy package” to replace their confidence and supply deal with the Tories which runs out in June.To say that these negotiations are delicate would be an understatement. I am told, “ people put too much pressure on them, there’s a danger that they’ll bolt”.But with this Speaker and this Parliament any hopes for a better one, or for a clean break, seem for the birds.As James Forsyth says, the “big beasts” of the backbenches must show some leadership.Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and Iain Duncan Smith were leading lights of the Leave campaign, but by not backing the deal they are now imperilling the whole project. They won’t be forgiven.Good card players know when to hold ’em and know when to fold ’em.Wise politicians must be no dferent.Butthe Government can get the DUP, it is confident that Jacob Rees-Mogg will then come on board.Despite voting against the deal on Tuesday, European Research Group chairman Rees-Mogg left himself a ladder to climb down, repeat­edly declaring that the only reason to vote for this deal wasBrexit was in genuine danger.After the Commons voted against No Deal and for an extension, it clearly is.The big question is how many Brexiteer rebels climb down Jacob’s ladder. Downing Street think there are  to  Tory diehards who won’t vote for the deal even with the DUP on board.The precise number is absolutely crucial. As one senior Downing Street source explains: “If it is at the lower end of that scale, it can be made up with Labour. If it is at the higher end, it can’t be.”There are, I’m told, between  and  Labour MPs prepared to back a deal but onlyit has a realistic chance of passing. Influential figures in the Cabinet are urging No to make the vote on Tuesday a free vote, to make it easier for Labour MPs to support it.If the deal doesn’t pass on Tuesday, then Mrs May will have to go to the European Council on Thursday and beg for a full-on extension to the Article  process. I am told she is dreading this personal and national humiliation.The Commons should spare her and, more importantly, the country, that.RIGHT now there is little sign that either Boris Johnson or Dominic Raab are going to move and back the Brexit deal.Both feel that their reservations about it are still too strong.But there is a danger for them both –  Tory Eurosceptics voted against the deal on Tuesday night.Whatever happens with the DUP, that number will drop a bit when the meaningful vote comes back for a third time.The danger for Boris and Raab is thatthey walk through the lobbies with this shrinking group, they will start to be seen as purely factional candidates, and purely factional candidates rarely win leadership contests.Already some of those who backed Boris last time and had been planning to do so again are peeling away.Now is a moment that calls for bigness.If either Boris or Raab were prepared to say that – despite their reservations – they were going to try to get the deal over the line, because Brexit is only going to get softer otherwise, they would show they have the selflessness necessary to lead.WHEN your voice is going, what’s the last thing that you want  A meeting with a heavy smoker.But that is what Theresa May had to contend with on Monday after she flew to Strasbourg for last-minute talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.By Wednesday, Mrs May’s voice was so bad that No had a plan for Andrea Leadsom,  to take over halfway through PMQsher voice gave out completely.TO get people to do things you need both a carrot and a stick.But the problem for the Government is that its warnings to Brexiteer rebels are all stick.It is pointing out that Brexit will only get softerMPs don’t vote for the deal. This is right, but these MPs need a positive inducement too.One Tory who carries messages from Theresa May’s Downing Street to the Brexiteer rebels tells me: “If she offered to go, she would get very close and possibly do it.“It unlocks those people whose self-perception is that they don’t give in to blackmail.” This source continues: “If the DUP move, Jacobmoves,Jacob moves others follow, but you don’t quite get there without the carrot.”Mrs May could leave with dignity, having secured an orderly Brexit and having managed to avoid a split in the Tory party.She wouldn’t need to leave the next day, either.But just in time to ensure that a new Prime Minister had their feet firmly under the desk before a new European Commission comes into office this autumn.One reason why an indication that May will go is so important is that there is assumption she will try to staythe withdrawal agreement passes.One Cabinet minister tells me: “If she gets a deal through, she won’t be able to resist clinging on.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But what does that actually mean, and where does it leave us  What has John Bercow said  Hes told the Government they cant keep bringing Theresa Mays rejected Brexit deal back to Parliament and hoping for a better result.In a bombshell for the Prime Minister, he said Commons rules say the same motion in substance...may not be brought forward again during that same session.

Bercow has ruled that the motion to pass the deal can only be brought back to the Houseit is substantially dferent from previous versions. The second Meaningful Vote was fine because the Prime Minister went to Brussels and secured extra concessions to go alongside the previous deal. But Bercow says a new motion will only be properit is neither the same, nor substantially the same as the one MPs voted down on March th. Is there a loophole the Government can use   There is, but its a risky move. The ruling only counts until the end of the current Parliamentary session - so theres already been talk of the Government scrapping it and starting a new one. Of course, theres no guarantee MPs will be any more inclined to back her deal after theyve been through the rigmarole of turning Parliament off and on again. Especially since it would scupper all the legislation currently in progress for Brexit just days before we leave the EU.  We dont know. To cancel Brexit would theoretically require a vote in Parliament to withdraw Article . Bercow suggested any member of the House could bring forward an emergency motion under Standing Order  of the House of Commons to do exactly that - but whether MPs would vote for it is another story. Does this make a long delay more likely   The plan the Government set out last week was thatshe doesnt get a deal through by Wednesday, the Prime Minister will go to Brussels and ask for a longer delay. In all likelihood, this delay would take us beyond June th, and that means we will have to take part in European Elections.  Not necessarily. It just means it would either have to wait for the Government to come back with a substantially dferent motion for MPs to attach it to, or for the Government to bring it forward themselves.

JobCentre staff will be able to refer claimants for treatment under the scheme by Tory Amber Rudd - with vulnerable people even assessed in the Jobcentre itself. The Work and Pensions Secretary said the scheme, to be trialled in Milton Keynes, will spot those in need and get them help quicker. But Mind, one of Britainaposs biggest mental health charities, told the Mirror Jobcentres are completely inappropriate for treatment. Policy manager Paul Spencer said we need to see improvements for mental health but these plans are not the way to do that.    He added: Mental health services should be delivered in a calm and therapeutic environment by people with knowledge and expertise about the complex and ying nature of mental health, and how it can impact someone’s le. Jobcentres are completely inappropriate environments to talk about mental health. They are usually busy, noisy and open-plan, causing anxiety and leading people to worry that private conversations can be overheard. He added: People with mental health problems repeatedly tell us they dread any encounters at Jobcentres because of a lack of trust and concerns that their benefits will be stopped or cutthey can’t do what’s asked of them. Even when Jobcentre initiatives are described as voluntary too many people still fear losing their benefitsthey’re not able to engage for any reason.  If people feel pressure to receive or undergo treatment which is not right for them, that risks damaging their trust in mental health services and willingness to seek help in the future, increasing the chance of people reaching crisis point. And he said: If the Government really wants to improve the support for people with mental health problems in the benefits system then they should remove the threat of sanctions altogether, and overhaul the culture of Jobcentres. Another charity, Rethink Mental Illness, said more specialist support for jobseekers was a positive thing. But policy chief Gillian Connor warned: We have also heard many upsetting accounts from people with mental health problems who felt pressured by the DWP to get working before they were ready, which only made them more unwell. Many people have also told us that a lack of understanding of mental illness among JobCentre staff has made every step of accessing benefits they rely on incredibly dficult.  Having more mental health trained specialists in job centres generally could help improve things, and it will be interesting to hear from those involved in the pilot how the trial goes to assess people in job centres and refer them for treatment. It’s good to trial new ideas but decisions need to be based on what’s best for the people the benefits system is meant to be there to support. The policy, unveiled over the weekend and confirmed today by Ms Rudd in the Commons, will see Department for Work and Pensionsand NHS staff test a new approach to treatment. Under the trial, DWP Work Coaches will be given new abilities to refer people for treatment. An initial mental health assessment would then take place in the Jobcentre itself - cutting out the current -day wait. DWP officials insisted the trial is entirely voluntary and designed to help people access support. Anyone taking part will be offered support by “trained healthcare professionals” in an area away from the main floor of the Jobcentre.Ms Rudd said: I know that the security of a regular wage, the camaraderie of the workplace and the self esteem you get from being in work can vastly improve the mental health of so many people.“That’s why providing people with mental health conditions with as much support as possible, so they can get back into work, is one of my top priorities.Health Secretary Matt Hancock added: The move is expected to signicantly improve waiting times for access to psychological therapiesservices and enhance the Jobcentre’s support so it reaches the most vulnerable people.  "},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn reveals love kebab","story":"NewsJeremy Corbyn reveals he love kebab shops despite being vegetarianThe Labour leader gave a short speech at the British Kebab Awards, which has become a popular event on the Westminster calendar.ShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video jeremy-corbyn-speaking-british-kebab-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJeremy Corbyn professed his love for kebab shops tonight, despite being a vegetarian.The Labour leader gave a short speech at the British Kebab Awards, which has become a popular event on the Westminster calendar.Speaking from the stage he said: It’s strange really, as one who chooses not to eat meat and chooses not to drink, I love kebab shops for what they do.

The man, who wishes to remain anonymous, says he started dogging in his early s. Speaking to the Liverpool Echo he slammed prudes who stereotype doggers as mac-wearing perverts. He claims that the x-rated activity shouldnt be a problem for non-doggers. He said: In the main, doggers are not mac-wearing perverts, or social misfits. Many drive nice cars, have regular jobs and live in suburbia. They are the type of people who live next door to you or work with you. What they all have in common is that they are turned on by the thrill of having sex in public. There really is no one stereotype. They are of all ages, shapes, sizes and backgrounds. I never came across an instance where a couple didn’t insist on condoms being worn - those involved in the scene practice safe sex.   This is not a social scourge that is causing distress to unsuspecting locals. It is a minority sport, taking place at remote beauty spots away from residential areas, mainly late at night. I understand why it mightn’t float most people’s boat but the prudes shouldn’t be allowed to spoil the fun for others because of their own sexual hang-ups. There are two types of dogging - pre-arranged and the spontaneous meet-up. Couples put on a show having sex in their car while letting others watch. There are dferent ways of letting voyeurs know its OK to come closer. Flashing headlights and switching interior lights on and off are two of the accepted signs. An open passenger door means come on inside, according to our former dogger.It tends to be a seasonal activity with the majority of it happening in the warmer weather and dogging almost exclusively takes place after dark.It was the internet that first alerted me todogging, the man said.   Ive always been a voyeur and the thought of meeting random couples to have sex was a real turn on. Then I found a website with a list of locations. I must admit to being sceptical when I parked up on a midweek summer evening. But after a while my attention was drawn to a group of men gathered around a car about  yards away. He says that the couple ended the show because they were put off by the number of men. That experience prompted a decade of dipping in and out of the dogging scene. The man said: I found it attracted people of all ages and social classes. Some couples make arrangements to meet by posting on internet forums, but I always preferred the spontaneous meet. He says he had many memorable moments during his decade on the dogging scene. He said: My most memorable moments included sex with a woman in the back of a BMW X while her partner sat in the front listening to the radio. The time a couple knocked on my window claiming they had a flat battery and askingthey could sit in my car for warmth which led to me having sex with the guys missus. There was the couple who invited me to follow them back to their flat in Wallasey before I bottled out on the stairs as I thought it was a set up . I vividly recollect when I was invited by a young couple to get involved in a sex session in their estate car on a private road near the oil refinery at Eastham, which came to an abrupt end when a security guard arrived. Alongside the spontaneous meet-ups the man says he also got to know couples who would become regular partners. More often than not people can find themselves sitting in car parks alone rather than enjoying a night of passion, he claimed He said: Looking back, I wasted many hundreds of hours of my le sat in car parks where nothing happened - afraid to leave in case a couple turned up minutes after Id left. Driving fromdoggingsite todoggingsite, up and down the Wirral, in search of action that never came. Sitting in vain next to a couple who werent looking for stranger sex but were just having a takeaway in their car on the way home from a night at the cinema. Fellow doggers would also get in the way, making territorial plays for prospective couples. Some have no patience and will tail a couple in their car from the second they arrive, pulling up inches away from their vehicle, rather than letting them settle in and get down to it at their own pace. Manys the time I saw a couple leave, sick of being hassled. I got to recognise the culprits, and would sit there, silently seething, knowing the night was a write-off, at least until they left. At one point, it was not unusual for me to be out until am, ing home and getting a few hours sleep before staggering, bleary-eyed, into work the next morning. Doggingwas like a drug and the adrenaline rush from the thought of something happening meant it was a hard habit to break. Then there were the risks and not just of being caught in the act by the police. When I started, not many people knew what the term dogging meant, but newspaper coverage of footballer Stan Collymore [and other celebrities] changed all that. Coupled with the internet, suddenly it became much more well-known. This attracted more and more boy racers, usually in battered Vauxhall Corsas, who charged up and down with their headlights on main beam, beeping their horns at doggers. The man says he was hounded by boy racers and threatened by another dogger for approaching a couple the man was interested in. On one occasion I was tailgated out of the site and jeered as they [boy racers] pulled alongside me on the dual carriageway. You are also at risk from aggressive doggers: one guy in a Ford Focus threatened to deck me after I approached a couple, even though I was there before him and had previously witnessed him muscle in on other meets. Now older and wiser, I do recognise that I took risks with my personal safety and it is one of the main reasons I weaned myself off it. But I would defend the right of others to do it, as long as it is done discreetly at a time when the general public are not around, he added.

Derby Crown Court heard how Linakar had in fact been working as an active postman on rounds up to five hours and had a season ticket to attend Manchester City games.He was also spotted on Facebook digging holes on a beach with his family, reports the Derbyshire Live . Surveillance footage taken by the Department of Work and Pensions during their investigation showed Linaker on his rounds.The court heard how he had been claiming disability living allowance since  and had accrued pound,. during that time. Judge Jonathan Bennett, presiding over the case, slammed Linakers down-right lies and jailed him for  weeks.   He said: “You are -years-old and you pleaded guilty at this court on February , to two matters of dishonest representation for the obtaining of benefit, disability living allowance. Benefits are meant for those who need help. “We live in times of austerity, the public purse is extremely tight and sometimes people who claim benefits are disparaged as scroungers. “You are of previous good character, but this not a question of you exaggerating claims, you told down-right lies.“You have a very long-standing condition with your hips and arthritis , but you had a partially-successful operation.“We came across surveillance footage and there are pictures of you on a beach having fun with the family and the kids, which people benefit claiming cant do. “I am going to give you a custodial sentence.” Christopher Jeyes, prosecuting, outlined the case.   He said: “The defendant has been claiming benefits since April  to May . “The  claims began in June  until . They lasted five years. “He had a hip replacement in  and had a leg brace. “He claimed disability living allowance and he said he needed help to get in bed, help going to the toilet, help washing and drying himself, assisted in the bath or shower. “He also said he had dficulty getting out of his chair and his vehicle. “It transpired these claims were untrue. “He was a season ticket holder at Manchester City and attended football matches regularly. He was employed as a postman, but he is no longer working  hours a week. He was given some time off for the hip replacement. He was allowed to sit down when sorting post and he was capable of sorting for . hours and was bending to do so. He also delivered mail five hours per day and was allowed to drive the bigger van.   Footage was taken of him on his round from a surveillance investigation. He was interviewed in June  and in that interview he was worn down and accepted the claims could be untrue. He described it as disgusting and that he couldnt believe what he wrote. In total, he claimed pound,.. On his form he said he was working at the Royal Mail. Nicola Hunter, mitigating, stated that Linaker was sorry for what he had done. She said: He is -years-old and has had deformed hips since his childhood. Coupled with that, he has osteoarthritis which causes him a lot of pain. He is sorry. He did make some admissions at interview and pleaded guilty at his first opportunity at this court. He has a we and a daughter. His daughter is in the middles of her mock GCSEs. He has no previous convictions.   His mother died last year and he has been grieving for her and been stressed about these proceedings. He has lost his job, lost his home and is on ESA and is paying the DWP back pound a week off his own back. Following the sentencing of Linaker, now of Languard Road, Felixstowe, Suffolk, the Department of Work and Pensions has issued a statement concerning those who dishonestly claim benefits. A DWP spokesman said:“Only a small minority of benefit claimants are dishonest, but cases like these show how we are catching the minority who cheat the system and ert taxpayers money from those who need it. “We are determined to catchthose we suspect of fraudulently claiming benefits by following up on tip-offs, undertaking surveillance and working with local councils.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum shocked finds just one","story":"NewsMum shocked as she finds just ONE crisp in sealed packet of Aldi snacksSupermarket bosses have apologised after Jade Higgins, from Manchester, was given a solitary snack inside her packet of Monster ClawsShareCommentsByKelly-Ann Mills:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video mums-shock-finds-just-one-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman was left shocked after opening a packet of crisps to find just ONE snack inside Jade Higgins recorded herself opening the bag of Monster Claws from Aldi after realising it felt lighter than normal.

They are the thousands of workers in the Philippines charged with cleaning up the internet for as little as p an hour on behalf of tech giants raking in billions. Facebook , Google and Twitter out-source to firms who employ thousands of mostly young content moderators in places like Manila, according to a hard-hitting documentary on BBC tonight. With pressure mounting on the social media firms to clamp down on harmful posts online, there is a lot of filth to filter. Facebook alone removed . million posts in the first quarter of , it has revealed – . million of graphic violence.  Some moderators have a staggering daily target of , posts to delete. As The Internet’s Dirtiest Secrets: The Cleaners shows tonight, it can all take a huge toll on workers, with at least one believed to have killed himself after being damaged by what he saw. One anonymous worker said: “I’ve seen hundreds of beheadings. It’s not really healthy. In this world there’s really an evil who exists. We need to watch for it. We need to control it, good or bad.” The show could not be more timely. Yesterday saw a pre-inquest review into the death of Molly Russell, , who took her own le after viewing disturbing self-harm material online. Directors Hans Block and Moritz Riesewieck claim it was a similar ­situation with the content moderator who killed himself. In an anonymous email a co-worker told them: “He was very close to me. I was worried, why he is not coming to work. My team-mate hung himself. “He was specialised on self-harm live videos. Bad effects of content moderation. The company kept it secret. Business as usual.”  An unnamed psychologist, who claims she saw the worker several times before he died, said he asked bosseshe could stop moderating self-harm videos. She said: “Three times he informed the boss to transfer him. They should do something. This was a cry for help.” Moritz says: “The whole staff were told it had nothing to do with their work but instead he had ‘private reasons’. “But according to his colleagues it was pretty obvious, this guy had to do with all kinds of self-harm videos and asked several times to get a dferent job.” The German directors believe other content moderators have killed themselves after the job became too much. “We were told, but again we can’t prove, that this is not a single case.” Much of the vile content deleted worldwide is sorted by articial intelligence, but some must be double-checked by human moderators, who are paid between p and £ an hour. The directors say in their investigation they discovered a very secretive industry with huge ­pressure put on workers not to talk about their work.  Hans says: “The companies use a lot of private policies and screen the accounts of the workers to make sure that nobody is talking with outsiders. “There’s a real atmosphere of fear and pressure because there are reprisals for the workers. They have to pay a £, feethey talk about what they’re doing. They even fear they will be put in jail.” Sarah T. Roberts, a professor of ­Information Studies at the University of Calornia, says outsourcing gives the firms legal distance from the work. “When Facebook and Google claim they don’t have employees in Manila, they can legitimately do that by using the labour of a third party firm,” she said.  Google said it had no moderators in Manila when the show was filmed, and it provides counselling to its reviewers. Twitter said it has “regular on-site counselling, training, and person-to-person support” for its staff.

There were teachers who would play the videos at school and some people laughed. Unlike his older brother and sister who went to a grammar school, Alex attended his local comprehensive.

Stacey Docherty, , allegedly encouraged Gary Hopkins, , to bludgeon Abdi Ali with a hammer and repeatedly stab him at their home in Enfield, north London, in December . She is said to have helped wrap the -year-old victims body in a duvet cover, clean up the blood-soaked living room and hide the body and murder weapons in the attic after pilfering his drugs and money. Police searched for the teenager for eight months after his family reported him missing. They were tipped off by a friend of Dochertys after Hopkins offered to show her the decomposing corpse.  Giving evidence Docherty spoke of her aggressive partner who was abusing her on a regular basis by the time of the killing. She explained Hopkins, nicknamed the magician by one of his dealers, became more controlling shortly after they met each other on a bus in September . She said Hopkins locked her in when he went out and slept with the keys under the bed next to his kne so she could not leave. Docherty said her partner agreed to let drug dealers sell out of their house to make it easier for themselves to get hold of some. Its known the Abdi, who she only knew as Skeng until after his death, came to stay by the end of . She told the jurors that Abdi was nice and lovely. When asked by her barrister, Bernard Richmond QC, when she was first aware that something had happened to him, she explained: It was in the early hours of the morning, and Gary was acting erratically, but I wasnt sure it was him at first. She said Hopkins walked into the bedroom where she had been asleep clutching a kne in his hand, telling her: We have got to go away because something really bads happened.  He said Ive lost it and he had his hands on his head, Docherty continued. She told jurors she was traumatised by the sight and didnt know what was going to be before me when Hopkins beckoned her into the living room. Jurors heard she walked into the front room to find blood stains all over the sofa and floor where Abdi lay looking like he was sleeping as Hopkins stuffed plastic bags over his head. Describing how Hopkins went about wrapping the teenagers body, she added: He did it like it was normal, and I was like, where was the emotion  That moment my whole le changed forever. She added: I started panicking. I started thinking oh my gosh the children are going to wake up and see this. Docherty helped Hopkins to put the body in the attic and told the jurors that Hopkins was a loose cannon and said the killing seemed like it was a long time coming. She said she was ashamed for not calling the police and giving Abdis family the peace of mind of knowing what happened to him sooner. I was scared, I thought I was going to be in the attic with him, she told the jurors. Jurors were told Hopkins waived his right to be in court for Dochertys defence and he was not in the dock.

They provide essentials like bread and milk that some of us take for granted. Coventry Foodbank is one of the largest in the UK and handed out more than , emergency food packages to people in the city during   - more than  every day. And even more worryingly, , of those went to families with children who would have otherwise gone hungry. Coventry Live chief reporter Katy Hallam decided to live off the same package handed out to people in the city. She also discovered what le is really like when you have no food in the fridge and the cupboards are bare. Here Katy reveals how she go on... Whats in the parcel   The following is what a single person is given as an emergency food supply for three days. The items will y because  per cent of the food is donated by the public.A small box of cereal Two cans of soup Two cans of beans or spaghetti Two cans of tomatoes or pasta sauce Two cans of vegetables Two cans of meat Two small pieces of fruit One can of rice pudding or custard A small packet of biscuits g of pasta, rice or noodles Tea coffee -  bags or a small jar One litre of long-le juice One litre of UHT milkI chose to do my shop at Tesco, as the supermarket has the most drop-off points for the foodbank in Coventry. Day One   I wasnt much looking forward to breakfast on day one of my foodbank challenge - oats and UHT milk. I have to confess Ive never actually eaten oats before and I doubt I will again. They were pretty flavourless. The main thing is they did the job of keeping me full until lunchtime which is the most important thing. And at least I had orange juice to wash them down. By the time Id finished my vegetable soup and lonely apple for lunch, I was still hungry.   Despite cups of tea to fill me up, my stomach was rumbling as I drove home from work. After my lunch, I was getting quietly confident that this challenge wouldnt be as bad as I thought. My first evening meal was an unappealing concoction of pasta, chopped tomatoes and fried spam. I even had to wash out my frying pan and start again when I realised I shouldnt have used oil! The finished product looked bad and tasted worse, so I used up my rice pudding on my first night to take the taste away. I went to bed miserably awaiting my breakfast the next morning. Day Two   I almost considered skipping breakfast completely because I really wasnt looking forward to my second morning of oats and UHT milk. But I knew that without them, Id really struggle to get through my day at work. If Id had some sugar, le would have been a million times better. The only plus was, again, the glass of orange juice afterwards that washed away the taste of the oats. Day twos lunch consisted of a can of chicken and mushroom soup .  Youre probably noticing quite a lot of repetition already - and this was the hardest part of the challenge, not the low quality of the food. My body was craving something - anything - dferent. And by this point the sugar craving had really kicked in. I dont normally drink fizzy drinks but suddenly I had the biggest thirst for Coca-Cola. After yesterdays spam concoction, I wasnt in a rush to make my dinner - even though I was really hungry. But I soon gave in to the pangs and poured out my pasta. This time, I added some sweetcorn and corned beef and mixed away.   This was probably my lowest point of the whole challenge. Corned beef looks like dog food and although Ive never eaten pet food I imagine it tastes worse, especially when its all mushed up into a big pink goo. I also realised that Id nearly made it to the age of  without knowing what the little stick on the top of the corned beef tin is for . Day Three  One good thing about my disastrous dinner the night before was that I was actually quite looking forward to my bland, tasteless oats. Or I was until I realised I had about a tablespoon of UHT milk left. There was nothing to do but add water to the tiny amount of milk. This was not setting me up for a good final day of the challenge. By day three, Id already consumed my two cans of soup and two apples. What was I going to do for lunch  I still had pasta, so I decided to split that between lunch and dinner.  I added in a tin of beans, and the leftover spam I had thankfully saved from day one. It sounds awful, but it was actually my favourite meal of the challenge! Things were looking up... By now, I fear I was starting to look a bit like a piece of penne pasta. But when you have no choice, youre grateful for what youve got so I was quite happy to dig into the carbs again after a fairly successful lunch.  And then I started making dinner. Even though I had no meat left, after my corned beef disaster I wasnt going to add any anyway. So I used my tin of peas and some of the leftover chopped tomatoes to bulk out my pasta. I think looking back this would have been the better option throughout! The tinned meat probably would have been better cold and as a side dish. Overall The food might not have been exciting but I was so relieved I had something to come home to. I struggled with concentration even after my first day on my minimal diet and when I worked out my calories at around  a dayI wasnt surprisied. The foodbank parcel isnt meant to be a long-term solution and relies on the goodwill of the public - more than  per cent of donations come from you. Its more than a shame that we even have the need for them in this country but they do an amazing job of getting you through those dire moments. The parcel tries to include a range of the dferent vitamins and minerals you need, albeit in a simple way. A lot of people were surprised the package included biscuits, but there were just four a day to spread over the challenge and I think I genuinely might have cracked without a tiny bit of sugar - especially after a depressing dinner.

Denise Knoxaposs partner Vincent Fuller, , was taken into custody on Saturday night on suspicion of attempted murder and racially aggravated public order offences. She told the Mirror how she was napping in front of the television when armed police broke down the door of the house she shares with Fuller. The raid came after reports a man was rampaging down a street in Stanwell, Surrey with a baseball bat and a kne around . pm, Locals said they heard a man shouting “kill Muslims” and “white supremacy” before stabbing a -year-old in a nearby Tesco car park shortly after pm. Terror cops last night said the victim was from southern Europe and that they believed his ethnicity was a motivation for the attack.  He was released from hospital yesterday after having an operation on his badly injured hands, police said. Police believe he was attacked in a Tesco car park a short walk from Fuller’s house, before the teen stumbled into a nearby McDonald’s and was taken to hospital by ambulance. Yesterday Vincent’s girlfriend of over two years Denise described the moment armed officers stormed Vincent’s flat where she had fallen asleep after watching comedy film The Hangover with him earlier that evening. She told the Mirror: “I woke up to hear police shouting at me to go downstairs. “Armed officers were already inside the house. They told me Vincent had been arrested. It was terrying, really, really scary.” Speaking from her home near Heathrow Airport, she said she had spent the evening with Vincent and his friend at Vincent’s flat when she fell asleep.  She woke up to find him gone and the police crashing into the upstairs maisonette. But she has vowed to stand by her man, a delivery driver, regardless of the outcome of his arrest. She said: “Vincent is not a terrorist. I have known him  years. He is caring and kind. “I will stand by him and I will still love him and I still want to be with him.” Denise said her Cha fan boyfriend was relaxed in the lead up to Saturday night and denied he was drunk or using drugs. According to eye witnesses a man walked into the Tesco car park and began ‘shouting abuse’, before setting his sights on the teen and slashing at his neck and hands as the victim he sat in a car. One said: “Myself, my partner and my friends went into Ashford Tesco’s to pick someone up. A man approached me and my friends and stabbed him. “We went to McDonald’s to get away from the scene and make sure he was safe. My friend is now at the hospital and is safe. “He is not in a critical condition but has a severe gash on his palm where he defended his neck. Everyone is now safe and home.”  Another added: “My partner told me that the man went up to the boy’s car and said ‘do you wanna die’ whilst twiddling the kne in his hand. “The boy tried putting his window up and he cut his neck and his hand - they drove over to McDonald’s to be safe until police came.” Counter terror police last night continued to probe the circumstances around the stabbing - and insisted it still had the “hallmarks of a terrorist event”. They said the alleged victim was “southern European” and that he “may have been targeted due to his ethnic appearance”. Officers are keen to speak to any witnesses and to anybody with footage of the attack. Detective Superintendent Nigel Doak, from Counter Terrorism Policing South East, said: “Whilst this investigation remains in the early stages, it has continued to show the hallmarks of a terrorist event.It is believed that the offender made racial comments and statements, promoting extreme far right views before carrying out the attack. “We are continuing to work closely with our colleagues in Surrey Police to build a better picture of what happened and to provide reassurance to the community. We believe the victim, a -year-old Southern European man, may have been targeted due to his ethnic appearance. “Extreme right wing investigations are pursued by our officers with the same level of resource and determination as other forms of extremist ideology. Magistrates granted officers permission under terrorism laws to detain the suspect until Saturday.

Rowling drops a major Harry Potter bombshell on her fans. Recently she shocked diehard Potterheads with the revelation that Voldemorts beloved snake, Nagini, is actually a Maledictus - a secret shed been keeping for  years. And now shes done it again, letting slip in a feature on the new Fantastic Beasts DVD that Dumbledore and Grindelwald had an intense and sexual relationship.She said: Their relationship was incredibly intense. It was passionate, and it was a love relationship. But as happens in any relationship, gay or straight or whatever label we want to put on it, one never knows really what the other person is feeling. You cant know, you can believe you know.   So Im less interested in the sexual side – though I believe there is a sexual dimension to this relationship – than I am in the sense of the emotions they felt for each other, which ultimately is the most fascinating thing about all human relationships.Unsurprisingly people on Twitter had a lot of thoughts about her confession. Many began trolling the writer and a hilarious new meme was born, with people joking about Harry, Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, Dobby, Dumbledore, Draco and more having some rather unusual sexual preferences.  One person wrote: Dumbldore and Grindelwald actually met on an app called WizrD. Another posted: Dumbledores patronus is the Grindr logo. A third commented: Cant wait for the J.K. Rowling E.L. James crossover,  Shades of Greyffindor, in which we learn that the greatest safeword is friendship.  Others compared J.K.s late revelations to fan fiction. Fanfiction writers walked so that J.K. Rowling could run. Semper Fi, tweeted a dferent user. However one person did very rightly remind everyone that J.K. Rowling created all of the characters so she can imagine all the weird and wonderful things she wants - whenever she wants. They said: I dont know anything about Harry Potter, nor do I care. But here is a reminder for anyone who is upset with J.K. Rowling commenting on the sexuality of character she invented... THEY ARE HER CHARACTERS IN HER STORY THAT SHE IMAGINED OUT OF NOTHING. They will be what she wants.

After facing off against Zlatan Ibrahimovic for Scotland in  and seemingly having the world at his feet, he now finds himself turning out for local junior side Lochee United.However, the big defender hopes to make his own history. vw, px\"  After winning the Scottish Cup with the Tangerines at Hampden in , Kenneth has designs on lting the junior version while, at the same time, go unbeaten over the course of the season with his team-mates at Thomson Park.The Dundonian was at the heart of the Bluebells’ defence as they won - at Troon in the quarter-final to set up a two-legged semi-final against holders Auchinleck Talbot – a repeat of last season’s semi.Kenneth spoke of his time away from the professional game and how he even came close to walking away from the sport.He said: “We want to go a step further this year and to get to the final and go on to win it.“I don’t think we should fear anyone – with the talent and the togetherness in the dressing-room we believe we can beat anyone.“There was a similar atmosphere in the Dundee United dressing-room when we won the cup, so I don’t see why Lochee can’t go all the way.“There’s no reason we shouldn’t be walking away with three or four trophies this year, we’re aiming to go unbeaten this season.“It would be nice to add a junior cup winner’s medal to the collection.“I’m not actually surea lot of people have done that before – winning both the pro one and the junior cup – so it would be really nice to get that.“We’re under no illusions here, we’ll just take it one step at a time but I’m ready for the challenge and looking forward to it.”Kenneth also added how grateful he is to Lochee for helping him rekindle his love for the game again after a dficult period which involved moves to Australia, Latvia and a spell at Brechin City.He admits he was close to walking away from the game in the summer.He continued: “I thought football was done for me after last season, I won’t lie about it.“It was really hard watching other guys getting chance after chance and you’re only getting the one, no matter how well you’re playing.“Sadly, that’s what happens in football and I’ve got no grudges about it and I’ve moved on from that.“In the summer I got a call from Lochee asking to come in and help out with a few friendlies and it’s kind of rolled on from there really. I’d played in the friendlies and was mixing with the boys really well. We’ve got a good bunch of lads here so that’s really helped at what already is a great club.“Sometimes it’s a risk taking a gamble on somebody who’s taken a bit of time out of the game.“I’m just happy to be back playing and training and, most importantly, I’m enjoying it again.“A break is needed sometimes, maybe so you can see how much you miss playing or even the buzz in and about the dressing-room and, most importantly, how much you love it.“When you’re playing full time and when you’re playing for so long, you kind of take it for granted.“You become immersed in it and you realise how dependent you are on the game as it’s always going to be there.“It’s when you take that step back it really hits home how much you need it in your le, that what’s happened in my case.“You just need to play for as long as you can and enjoy it for as long as you can, or until, unfortunately, your body gives up on you.“I’ve always been the type of person who wants to win every game and every duel –you’re playing football and you don’t want to play and win every game then you’re most likely in the wrong profession.“I’ve still got that hunger that I’ve took everywhere with me, it’s just the type of person I am.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sam stanton says dundee united need to block out doubt and focus again","story":"Dundee United need to ignore everything that’s happening around them and just concentrate on winning matches between now and the end of the regular season.As the Tangerines head for in-form Dunfermline today, that’s the view of midfielder Sam Stanton.On paper it looks a task that could prove easier said than done.Championship leaders Ross County are in action again tonight and,they come out on top in the Highland derby at Inverness Caley Thistle, their advantage over United will be stretched to a massive  points.With nine games to go, for many that would mean the race for automatic promotion was effectively over.Most in the Tannadice dressing-room don’t see things that way and, with two games against the Staggies still to come, for the time being at least, there’s no way boss Robbie Neilson and his players are conceding anything.Stanton, though, is happy to leave such discussion to others because he knowshis team are not winning on a regular basis, that alone will extinguish hopes of ato the Premiership this year.“Everyone can see it’s a big lead Ross County have over us now so, obviously, all we can do is try to put pressure on them and you do that by winning games,” he said.“But the big thing at this time of the season is to build momentum and that’s what we have to do, whether that’ll be to catch County or to go up through the play-offs.“And there is no point in looking at them, it’s completely on us and what we do.“We can narrow the gap because we play them twice. We can beat them in both of those games, we know we’re capable of that but we’d need to win all the other games as well.“What’s important is that we go on a winning run because that’s a massive thing going into the end of the season, whether you’re going for automatic promotion oryou are going to be in the play-offs.”The -year-old’s experience of the second tier tells him how dficult that’s going to be and,anything, he believes putting together a winning run this term is harder than it’s ever been.“I think when you look at the league right now you see that any time you’re playing, there is no guaranteed games you are going to win.“Everyone in the league has something to play for, whether it’s the teams up at the top or the ones down at the bottom.“I think this is one of the tightest seasons I’ve seen for a few years.”That view is backed up by the progress of today’s opponents.Until a five-game winning streak, the Pars were looking over their shoulders and worrying about being dragged into a relegation dogfight.Now they’re in a play-off spot and,they can make it six wins on the trot today, they’d be challenging United in the race for second place.That makes this game almost as vital as the looming clash with Ross County at Tannadice on Tuesday.Stanton knows he and his team-mates will have their work cut out today but stressed the aim is to maintain an unbeaten East End Park record that stretches back to .“As a club we’ve had a good record against Dunfermline and we want to keep that going.“They are on a good run right now but we believe we can go there and win.“If we do win this one we keep a gap to the teams below us.“That’s important but we just have to look to be winning games as often as possible.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"taking-your-car-abroad-after-brexit-looks-like-youll-be-needing-a-green-card","story":"THE prospect of a no-deal Brexit, meaning no transition period, will mean insurance lsquogreen cardsrsquo will be required for UK drivers venturing across the Channel or into the Republic of Ireland from March , ."},{"url":null,"title":"craigholme-school-glasgow-girls-school-to-close-over-dwindling-pupil-numbers","story":"A GLASGOW school ndash one of the last private girlsrsquo secondaries in Scotland ndash is set to close as a result of falling pupil numbers."},{"url":null,"title":"princes-street-evacuation-suspicious-package-found-day-after-glasgow-university-on-lockdown","story":"BREAKING:Glasgow Universityrsquos Dumfries campus evacuated after lsquosuspicious packagersquo found.

In my time here, we’ve had loads of games where we’ve not been at our best for whatever reason.“But we’ve had loads of - McGinn, - Rooneys.“To concede the type of goal we did from a free-kick so far out – it wasn’t a free-kick by the way, the referee’s got it badly wrong.“We should still see that offwe defend with the same authority and calmness we’ve been doing of late. But we gt it, we get sucked towards the ball, we don’t win the header and allow our man to work off us, and then they get the goal.”The draw was a missed chance to make up ground on second-placed Rangers – who also drew, - at home to Kilmarnock.McInnes said: “We knew with Rangers and Kilmarnock playing something had to give and we could’ve gained on both of them or one of them, but we haven’t.“We’ve come through a tough spell, wanted three points and the first goal should’ve been enough to get that.“We haven’t lost any ground, but it could’ve been a better day for us.”McInnes also revealed he’d been forced to tackle Livi with the walking wounded, including centre-back Scott McKenna – who now looks set to miss Scotland’s first Euro  qualier against Kazakhstan on Thursday with a thigh problem.He had planned to speak to Dark Blues boss Alex McLeish saying: “I’m not a medical expert, but having spoken to the physios and doctors, they would have a real concern for him being fit for Thursday.“I think he’ll be fit for the Sunday game .“We’ll need to make a decision between us and Scotland whether he travelsor stays behind for treatment so he’s more fit for the second game.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/MPU-offers.jpg ","title":"aberdeens miss selfridge launches closing down sale","story":"A popular fashion brand has slashed prices ahead of its Aberdeen store shutting.Staff at Miss Selfridge in the St Nicholas Centre were seen posting signs advertising price cuts of up to % as part of their closing down sale.Customers have been advised they will still be able to purchase items from the brand at Outfit in Union Square.The retailer was the first shop to open in the centre, shortly after construction was finished in .Miss Selfridge has been contacted for comment.Centre manager Craig Stevenson said: “We can confirm that Miss Selfridge have made the decision to close the store located in the St Nicholas mall, Bon Accord.#"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/MPU-offers.jpg ","title":"bomb disposal squad called to incident near aberdeen beach","story":"Bomb disposal crews have been called after an object was discovered at the mouth of an Aberdeen river.Police Scotland and coastguard teams are also in attendance at the mouth of the River Don.Emergency services were alerted by a member of the public shortly after pm today.A police spokesman said: “We received a call from the member of the public saying they had found an object washed up on the beach near the mouth of the River Don.“Explosive Ordnance Device teams have been called as a precaution.”A coastguard spokesman added: “We are assisting Police Scotland after an object was discovered.“A cordon has been set up in order to protect the public.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/03/5c8f43416c5a50.94140696.jpg ","title":"north east residents say area unsafe after new street lights installed","story":"Residents in a north-east community believe new street lights have made the area unsafe.Aberdeenshire Council has replaced lighting in Portlethen as part of a scheme to improve efficiency and reduce costs.However, residents claim the new LED lights are much dimmer than the previous versions and have voiced concerns over community safety. vw, px\"  A resident, who lives on Ninian Place, said: “The old lights were taken out without any warning and the new ones are just not bright enough.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal.

The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder.

The cash injection could double the  aerospace jobs in Ayrshire to . The money has been announced as part of the Ayrshire Growth Deal, which was agreed last Friday. Plans for two new aircraft hangars have been revealed. There will be a purpose-built ,ft² aerospace and space innovation centre for research and business development in partnership with universities. A visitor centre promoting science around space and aviation is also included in the bid. And up to to ,ft² of industrial manufacturing space is to be developed. Publicly-owned Glasgow Prestwick Airport has made a loss in the past. A transport assessment is taking place to weigh up the impact of expansion on rail and road links. The airport vision was revealed on Friday when the Ayrshire Growth Deal heads of terms agreement was signed by politicians. Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell said: “From a UK perspective Prestwick is one of the most important sites for aerospace and a potential spaceport.” Transport secretary Michael Matheson said the plans would see the public and private sector join forces with academia to grow the aerospace and space sector. The deal sees £ million invested by the UK Government, £ million by the Scottish Government and £ million from South Ayrshire Council in the airport. South Ayrshire Council leader Douglas Campbell said the deal overall ensured Ayrshire “punches well above its weight in terms of what we contribute to the economy”. He described the signing of the heads of agreement as a “truly historic occasion” and the “pinnacle of more than three years of hard work.” Councillor Brian McGinley, local economy and culture chief, said: “To make the most of this investment we are determined that the benefits are shared by all, bringing quality training and jobs that will pay good wages.” Overall the £. million Ayrshire Growth Deal aims to generate  jobs. The investment will be delivered over  years.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrshire primary school blasted hm","story":"NewsAyrshire primary school blasted in HM Inspectors report cardAdditional support is needed to help schoolShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsShared campus of Patna and St. Xaviers primary schools.\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA primary school has been slated in an HM Inspectors report card. Panta Primary School, which also incorporates an Early Childhood and Support Learning Centre, was rated “weak” across two quality indicators following a recent visit. A team of HM Inspectors visited the school, which shares a campus with St Xavier’s PS, in December, but their findings were only made public last week. The school was deemed to have fallen short under the ‘Learning, teaching and assessment’ quality indicators- with the report stating that, in the majority of lessons, children were “slow to engage in their work” and “required encouragement” to start tasks. Inspectors said that children’s “curiosity and engagement” was “not being developed well enough” and they mentioned an “important weakness” in children’s learning. In another body blow, the school was rated “weak” when it came to raising attainment in literacy and numeracy. The report states: “Overall attainment in literacy and numeracy is weak. As a result, HM Inspector, Carol Copstick, said that the school needed “additional support” in to make “necessary improvements.” HM Inspectors willto the school within a year to ensure that progress is being made. St. Xavier’s Primary School, which is based in the same campus, was deemed to be “very good” and “good” across two key indicators during a  inspection. SNP Doon Valley councillor John Bell, said he was initially shocked by the report and said the school had dedicated, conscientious staff and fantastic, hard-working children.” On a positive note the school was praised for its “caring ethos” and the “positive relationships” fostered by the nursery team. Linda McAulay-Grfiths, East Ayrshire Council’s head of education said: “It’s important to remember that a school inspection report is a snapshot in time and many of the recommendations contained in the Inspector’s report are being implemented, or are already in place.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEast Ayrshire CouncilScottish National PartyEducationSchoolsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"end era popular ayr music","story":"NewsEnd of era as popular Ayr music shop shuts downBig Sparra Vinyl in Ayr has announced its closure following a recent flood at the New Bridge Street store.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  MAR NewsIan Wallace of Big Sparra Vinyl \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt’s the end of an era for a much-loved record store which has touched the hearts- and ears- of many across the country.

The application got the go-ahead at the South Ayrshire Council Regulatory Panel last week. Discount store Home Bargains sells budget toys, household and beauty and gardening products. The Food Warehouse has a bigger grocery choice than Iceland as well as bulk buys. Ayr Central operators MG Real Estate lodged an objection to the plan. Representing them, Planner Kathryn Donnelly told the meeting: “We believe the proposals could be incorporated into the town centre.” She added: “There is an urgent need to protect Ayr town centre.” Ms Donnelly, of GL Hern, told councillors: “We need to entice national retailers.”   She said Ayr Central supports  local jobs. Ediston representative Alex Mitchell said Food Warehouse would take up , square feet. Mr Mitchell, of Zander Planning, said: “No units like that are available in the town centre.” Claiming it could bolster the town in general, he said: “Retail parks can draw people in from surrounding areas.” A document said the empty Homebase premises were too big for just one shop. Councillors approved requests to allow planning unit to be ided into two shops, and permit homeware goods and food to be sold from it. Councillor Peter Convery said: “There isn’t one of us here who doesn’t want the town centre to be vibrant again.” Expressing his support for the High Street and Heathfield,  chair Councillor Brian Connolly said: “We want them all to be successful.” But Councillor Andy Campbell said: “This has been an opportunity to attract outlets to the town centre.

And they called for better conditions for workers and customers. It is understood Ayr railway station will never operate from the abandoned building again. Now there are plans for Scotrail workers to move into other portable cabins at the bottom of the car park on Station Road. South Ayrshire Council was forced to take control of the privately owned Station Hotel last year when its dilapidated state made it a danger to the public. Station staff were moved to portable cabins beside the building. Mick Hogg, regional organiser for the RMT union in Scotland, said staff working conditions are unacceptable. He said: “We need a facility that is fit for purpose. “We would rather see the building demolished. We want to start from scratch to ensure our members are working in a safe environment.” He added: “Our members and the travelling public should not be subjected to any health and safety risk as a result of this shambles at Ayr Station. The shambles has been created by the refusal of Network Rail and other stakeholders to take ownership of a building that was falling to bits.” Union representatives want workers moved to the better portacable cabins on the other side of the railway tracks as soon as possible. Health and safety rep Willie Harper said: “It has been very challenging.” Gerry McCann, an RMT official from Ayr, said: “The staff are crammed into a portable cabins. There is no fresh running water.” He said facilities were not good enough for rail passengers. People waiting for trains to Glasgow or bus links to the ferries at Cairnryan have no shelter. He said: “People have to stand out in the rain. We want action.” An exclusion zone is in place around parts of the hotel to keep people away from the structure while work proceeds to make it safe. MSP Colin Smyth met the union and Scotrail to make the case for improvements last week. He said: “While staff had to be moved quickly out of offices which were part of the same building as the Station Hotel due to safety fears, the temporary arrangements put in place don’t deliver for staff o.” The council are in discussions with Transport Scotland, Network Rail and Scotrail about the future of the building. A Scotrail spokesman said: “We are committed to providing the best possible working environment for our people.

Fortunately, blood tests showed she was regenerating her own blood cells.After a tense  hours following surgery, to make sure she recovered, Teal was allowed home.Jim added: ldquoNot only did the owner react very quickly, but the whole team at Border Vets pulled together and stayed behind long after their working day had finished to ensure the best possible outcome for Teal.ldquoIrsquom over the moon with her recovery as she looks great and I canrsquot praise the fantastic teamwork by everyone at the practice enough.Teal lives with Jackie, her husband and their three sons, at their home in Galashiels.Jackie said: ldquoShe is an obedient dog but I think she misheard the command while we were waiting to cross the road.\"Irsquove never been in such a panic in all my le. Although there wasnrsquot a mark on her, she appeared fine for a short while however very quickly she deteriorated and became very poorly and couldnrsquot move very well.ldquoI couldnrsquot see a positive coming out of this situation and was worried about having to tell the children she had been put to sleep because she is part of the family.\"But I knew she was in the right place at Border Vets.

how does a small childs cross pose a risk to anyone \"And from what we were told, they were going to inform familiesa stone required work to make it safe.\"There are now broken gravestones lying all over our cemetery - this wasnt a safety inspection.\"Scottish Borders Council is responsible for  cemeteries across the region.And they have health and safety obligations for all employees, contractors and visitors to each of the graveyards.Although headstones are the responsibility of the lair-holder, due to the age of many graves tracing families is dficult.A five-year rolling programme of safety checks began in September with  cemeteries earmarked for the initial checks.But for several families the heavy-handed testing regime - which has left many memorials broken - has come as a shock.One daughter, who we agreed not to name, said: \"My parents grave is neither old nor what you would describe as large, yet it has been taken from its base.\"I have been really upset by this -I or any of my family had known the stone was loose we would have had it repaired.\"Nobody has been in touch with me or my brother.\"According to the Scottish Borders Councils own guidelines on the testing procedures, an initial sight test would be followed,required, by a gentle hand push.All memorials were to be classed as either stable, slight movement or unsafe.And only memorials found to be in a dangerous condition will be cordoned off and or made safe.The guidance also states that they will ensure the work is undertaken with due respect and only when absolutely necessary.Scottish Borders Council has defended the testing procedures by the contracted company.A spokesman for the authority told us: \"The council took the decision to test all the headstones in the old section of Peebles Cemetery, regardless of size and age, following a risk assessment.\"This is part of a phased approach to testing which sees sections of cemeteries categorised based on estimated footfall, age, location and size of the memorials.\"So far the majority of unstable memorials tested across the Borders have been made safe by socketing, which means keeping the headstone upright with the majority of the inscription still visible for families and visitors to read.\"This is a recognised approach which balances the cultural importance associated with these historic memorials and the need to keep our cemeteries safe for the public to visit.\"Socketing is the preferred technique compared to other alternative methods such as lying flat, staking, banding or full repair, all of which carry signicant consequences to the future stability of the memorials or signicant costs.\"A total of  headstones were tested in Peebles Cemetery with  deemed unsafe.Council bosses have admitted they will discuss issues over stones being broken during the inspection.The spokesman added: \"We accept that during this signicant safety programme, and considering the nature of the memorials that we are dealing with, there will be occasions where a memorial can become damaged while being made safe.\"If anyone notices a memorial which they have a legal interest in and which they believe has been damaged during the process of making it safe, they can contact the council to discuss the matter further.\"Other graveyards which are included in the initial phase of inspections are Innerleithen, Wairds , Shawfield , Ashkirk, Earlston, Heriot, Lilliesleaf, Kelsoand Kelso , Ancrum, Denholm, Wellogateand Wilton , Ayton, Duns, Lennel and Eyemouth.Babies graves, war graves and many brokenWhere a memorial is classied as unsafe and there is an immediate safety concern, thememorial will be made safe.

The objectors also presented evidence to the committee showing how their own planning policies were being ignored by their officials.Peebles Community Council and many residents objected to the land at South Parks site being earmarked for development in the Local Development Plan back in .Mr Turnbull said: ldquoWhat makes objectors particularly annoyed is the notion that once building sites have been included in Local Development Plans, their inclusion cannot be questioned.\"Their views then were ignored just as their views have been totally ignored now. One of the questions that needs to be asked is, why Mr Turnbull said the conduct of the planning committee with the housing application was ldquoappalling and added that the system is loaded in favour of developers.He added: ldquoWell over  dferent objectors submitted some very detailed evidence to planners who ignored it.\"This has brought many objectors to question the validity of the planning process. It would appear that this process is designed to allow developers to build as and when they want and they can appealtheir application is refused.ldquoObjectors on the other hand have no right of appeal given that they have no right of appeal it is surely essential that they are given a fair hearing where evidence is properly considered.ldquoIn the South Parks case, Councillor Fullarton made comments regarding the Caledonian Road being wide and safe, based on his knowledge of over  years ago - no one challenged him.ldquoWhat has caused so much anger was that not a single councillor on the committee knew enough about Peebles to question Councillor Fullartonrsquos assertion. It may be that the planning committee has insufficient time to deal properly with these more complicated and contentious applicationsthat is the case then something has to change.ldquoThey simply failed to understand the issues before them nor the tremendous amount of anger within our community.\"The Scottish Government has launched an initiative called Democracy Matters, which aims to improve the level of involvement of local communities.Mr Turnbull continued: ldquoWhat is the pointplanning officers can write what they want, ignore government guidance and legislation, which is then allowed to stand by councillors who either do not have the knowledge to challenge them or the will to do so. For democracy to matter the peoplesrsquo voice needs to be heard.The community leader says the democratic deficit will be brought into sharp focus with the next Local Development plan, and heeded a warning to elected councillors to be prepared to answer why Peebles is mooted for major development when Scottish Borders Council is not prepared to develop infrastructure first.Scottish Borders Council strongly refutes the claims that councillors and officials ignored the views of the community.A spokesperson said: ldquoAll planning decisions require the delicate balancing of a range of policy objectives and other material factors, including the views expressed by the Community Council.\"The two recent planning applications in Peebles highlighted how dficult that can be and the complexity of the decision making process. Both proposals were subject to detailed analysis, which was reflected in the presentation of the cases by officers and the y debate members had on these applications.ldquoIt is clear that a considerable amount of time was spent considering the points and issues made both for and against the proposed developments. Indeed, both applications were revised to take into consideration the views expressed by local residents and the Community Council.ldquoUltimately, and after considering all of the evidence before them, the Committee came to the view that it could support one of the applications, which was the development at South Parks.

pound for each offence - and there is still a pound bill outstanding for the  original parking offences between April and July last year.Humphries of Bourtree Place, Hawick, pleaded guilty at Selkirk JP Court to a total of  charges.Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser told the court that there was no CCTV in the car park showing who had come to collect the car on the days of the offences and Humphries had never informed the council of the identity of the driver despite the repeated requests.But he pointed out Humphries worked in the Iceland store which is right beside the High Street car park.Mr Fraser also said that failing to reveal the identity of the driver carried a maximum penalty of pound, for each offence.He explained that the council had to go through the laborious process of establishing who the regular keeper of the vehicle was and to find out who the driver was for the penalty to be paid.Mr Fraser said:\"In relation to all these charges he ignored the correct parking penalty which was not paid.\"There were other people who could have used this car parkspace but have not been able to do so.\"The accuseds vehicle repeatedly committed the offences of being parked overtime.\"Who did that we do not know as the accused did not bother to communicate with the council and say who the driver was which is a legal requirement.\"Not guilty pleas to nine other charges relating to the parking offences were accepted by the Crown.Defence lawyer Colin Severin said his client was negotiating with the council about the outstanding parking fines.He added: \"He got to the point where he was bogged down with the volume of letters coming through and did not know how to react.\"Andrew Bramhall JP told Humphries that ulging the identity of the identity of the driver when an offence is committed was an important part of the Road Traffic Act legislation.He said: \"The onus was on you and it has mounted up considerably.\"Mr Bramhall said he would have fined Humphries pound for each offence but restricted the fine to pound due to the guilty plea.As there were  offences, the fine totalled pound -

cut in youth and adult learning, a cut in environmental warden services, which means a focus on more fines but less time for fly tipping and dog fouling and a cut to music tuition in schools.There

Lauder, it is said, was the first place he stopped after fleeing from the Battle of Prestonpans.ldquoI suppose we kind of followed in his footsteps, said my friend, ldquoalthough in a very dferent way and totally dferent circumstances of course. Folk round here donrsquot really know the story, but coming from the Pans it gave us an immediate connection.The actual house on Lauder High Street that Johnnie Cope arrived at is now gone, replaced over  years ago. But Lauder must look much as it did on that fateful day when Cope arrived, with his horse close to collapse with exhaustion.Johnnie Cope was the general commanding the British Army at Prestonpans on that fateful day, September , . The battle was a major victory for the Jacobites. Cope fled the scene of battle, but only when it was clearly lost. He eventually arrived at Berwick-upon-Tweed to give news of his own defeat. Ever since, popular tradition has mocked Cope for running away and not standing his ground and dying lsquohonourablyrsquo, as Colonel Gardiner of Bankton House did.This ridicule was encapsulated in a traditional popular song, and the chorus remains well-known:Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye wauking yet Or are your drums a-beating yet If ye were wauking I wad waitTae gang to the coals irsquo the morning.The song pokes fun at Cope and concludes with a harsh indictment:Now Johnnie, troth, ye were na blateTae come wirsquo news orsquo your ain defeat,And leave your men in sic a straitSae early in the morning.There are earlier versions with slightly dferent words, but the sentiment remains the same: Johnnie Cope ran away and should be ashamed of himself for leaving his men. However, he was later found to have done his duty, and this reputation deemed unfair. But mud sticks, especially when a catchy tune is added to it.This popular song is believed to have been written by Adam Skirving, a farmer at Garleton in East Lothian. There is a story that he visited the battle site a few hours after the fighting. Perhaps he spoke to some eyewitnesses who saw Cope flee up the road to Birsley Brae, and therefore got the idea for the song. The road Cope took as he fled from the battle has ever after been called Johnnie Copersquos Road.Lauder is a short journey from Prestonpansgoing by car. It had been a while since I had last ventured over Soutra Hill and into the border country and I enjoyed the drive despite the wild weather, or perhaps partly because of it.But what was Copersquos journey like as he galloped over Soutra Hill with some of his dragoons  He must have paused at the summit and cast a glance at the view over East Lothian and screwed his eyes to find Prestonpans. The panic and terror by this time would have given way to dferent feelings, I suspect.He rode more or less the same way I took to Lauder but it would have taken him much longer with very dferent emotions. His arrival in the town would have been a bewildering spectacle for the locals. He later continued his flight to Coldstream, which he reached by nightfall.All this was in my head as we headed home to Prestonpans from Lauder the next day. I could almost see the ghosts of Cope and his dragoons gallop past us as we ventured over Soutra.As we drove, I re-told the story to my kids and we sang the song in the car. They know the story and the chorus well, as we have many times ventured along Johnnie Cope Road on the way to the rail station.By the road is Bankton House, once the home of Colonel Gardiner, who did not run but stood his ground, and paid the ultimate price with brutal death.There is a small doorsquocot by the house, and inside you will find a free but almost secret visitor centre created with the support of the Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust.The doorsquocot can only be reached via a walkway through the wood from the rail station during the day, and inside lsquoAuld Archiersquo tells the tale of the battle, and the le and death of Colonel Gardiner. On the wall is a model map of how the area looked at the time of the battle, with the route taken by Johnnie Cope clearly marked.Itrsquos all fascinating stuff which had been unexpectedly brought to my mind by the visit to Lauder to see old friends.But it was the emotions rather than the events that I reflected on most. The hatred caused by this civil war , the loss, suffering and misery of conflict which is so often hidden by a cloak of romanticism.Adam Watters, a Panner who lives and breathes local history, and re-enacts it for children and visitors alike, is clear on this. It is a fascinating period to study, and to have the history on our doorstep brings it alive. But as Adam has said, letrsquos enjoy that sense of history on our doorstep and have fun with it, but let us not glory battle, rather learn from it.I think Johnnie Cope, even though he was a military man, may well have agreed with Adam."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-cockenzie-revised-plan","story":"Inch Cape Offshore Ltd has been given approval to site the building ndash which will bring energy ashore from an offshore wind farm ndash on land at the former Cockenzie Power Station by Scottish Ministers.A planning application was initially lodged with East Lothian Council but was called in by the Scottish Government before a decision was made.That decision sparked anger after it was announced as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on an official visit to China, where she met representatives of Chinese state owned Red Rock, which owns Inch Cape.Now the company has presented a revised plan of the space it intends to use to Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council.The community council posted the new design on social media and revealed plans were under way for Inch Cape to host workshops in the local communities in the coming months.The image shows the substation on about a third of the original .-hectare footprint applied for.One of the biggest concerns raised by communities and the local authority, which owns the land, was that a substation dominating the old power station site would make it a no-go area for other developments.The new plans were welcomed by many on the community councilrsquos Facebook page, with one person saying: ldquoGood news, less sterilisation of the site.Ian Johnson, Inch Capersquos project manager, said: ldquoWe are continuing to engage with East Lothian Council and local community councils on options to signicantly reduce the footprint of the onshore transmission works and moving this to the west of the site.ldquoWhile this detailed design plan is subject to further technical assessments, consultation and approval from the council, we are taking steps to ensure remaining land is available for other developments."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-school-pupils-to-take-part-in-strike-against-climate-change","story":"The NBHS Eco Committee have encouraged students to travel by public transport to attend the rally campaigning for stronger government action to combat climate change.The Edinburgh protest is one of many around the world that are happening tomorrow morning, where school children are walking out of classes to protest climate change.The protest starts at am outside the Scottish Parliament.An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: ldquoWe want to support our young people as global citizens to have their voice and to be able to express their views on important matters such as climate change.\"The safety and wellbeing of our young people is of paramount importance to us.

deer may also want to give up on growing prize roses and instead pick plants they do not seem to like so much, such as Daphne, red hot pokers and butterfly bushes.With sightings of deer in urban areas on the increase, the Royal Horticultural Societyhas surveyed members to see which of the mammals they are seeing in their gardens and what kind of damage they are causing.Nearly  gardeners completed the survey from across the country, with , records of the effects of hungry deer on  popular garden plants.The survey found roe deer were the most commonly sighted, in % of gardens, followed by Reevesrsquo muntjac which were seen in % of gardens,while fallow deer were spotted in % of the gardens of people responding.If they could see deer had tucked into a plant, people were asked to record the amount of damage on a sliding scale from untouched to impossible to grow.Where there were more than  entries for a plant, the researchers used the scores submitted to work out a percentage likelihood of it being eaten.It revealed that some popular plants faced a major risk of damage ndash with a more than % chance of being chomped ndashincluding tulips, roses and holly.But  plants were largely shunned, with a minimal or less than % risk of damage, including daffodils, bay, primula and nerine.In the case of daffodils, they are known to be mildly toxic, which could account for why they are less appealing to deer.While what deer eat will also depend on what is in the garden they visit, the experts hope the findings help highlight which plants are the most popular with the peckish pests and therefore the most susceptible.Published as the new growing season gets going, the information could help gardeners with a deer problem switch what they are growing and protect their planting.The RHS also recommends other precautions including planting closer to the house and human activity, protecting all new plants with netting until they are established and erecting deer proof fencing to protect larger areas.Jenny Bowden, horticultural adviser at the RHS, said: ldquoOur findings suggest that deer have a taste for certain plants, although itrsquos worth remembering that what is a food favourite in one garden might not be in another.ldquoWhile a little bit of damage wonrsquot mean yoursquoll want to give up,damage is sustained and bothersome, switching to plants shown to be less appealing might do the trick.ldquoYou never know, you might also be inspired to grow something new.Some of the popular plants with minimalrisk of damage were:daffodils, Daphne, bay, globe

Still, mixing metaphors and managers, in the words of Ally MacLeod in , itrsquoll be fine once we get to the World Cup. It might well bethe final  minutes in west London was anything to pin your hopes on.With France beating Italy and Wales clinching the Grand Slam against the Irish, it effectively turned the Twickenham game in to a dead rubber.

A chance for some exhibition stuff, surely  Yes, but no-one could possibly have predicted the twists and turns that would fill match time.Yesterday began with the match ball being delivered, after a bike run from Stirling to Twickers, by former Scotland captain Rob Wainwright, round the world biker Mark Beaumont, endurance cyclist Russell Ky and a few other on their latest Doddie Gump, on behalf of the My Namersquo Doddie Foundation. A worthy cause, but as England were running in tries for fun during the opening exchanges at the rate of a point per minute, a well-intentioned wrong turning somewhere in the Midlands may have been a better idea.

Yesterday that was all it took, in seconds, for England to score. Cue lsquoSweet Chariot.rsquo Unfortunately, it was supercharged and had four-wheel drive and rumbled over the Scots in those early battles. Around this time I received a text from a mate. ldquoHeading back in to Richmond and the Orange Tree. Cannae watch this. I hope they had a telly.For when all appeared lost, from somewhere, Scotland managed to pull out a fightback of epic proportions. Guys who had looked lost, suddenly became world -beaters McInally, Maitland, Graham, Russell, Johnson and others, all of them really. We knew Scotland could play like that. We had seen it before. But given how their self-belief must have been steamrollered in that opening quarter, this effort will be written in to Scots rugby,not sporting folklore. But let us not forget how close wersquod come to an absolute disaster yesterday before salvaging self-respect and some much-needed championship points. But what, ultimately, have we achieved this far in to  Before a ball was kicked, passed or dropped in anger, I had upset one or two with my prediction that, at best, Scotland might finish fourth in this yearrsquos Six Nations. My guesstimate actually had a bit of logic behind it. Italy was a given, but we donrsquot win on the road that often, especially in Paris or London, while Ireland and Wales are quitedecent teams, but at Murrayfield, we just might ndash with a decent wind - shade it against one of them.We didnrsquot and fourth became fth, accompanied by a catalogue of excuses not turning pressure in to points, not being accurate or clinical enough, and, not having any luck when it comes to losing key personnel. Letrsquos take that point firstThere has been a steady progression at international level whereby Scotland has built strength and experience in depth, something that on reflection, really wasnrsquot there a decade back, no matter how much we may kid ourselves. However, unlike England and perhaps the French, Scotland still donrsquot have the cover or resource to accommodate a casualty count running in to double figures,not dozens.Even for the layman, the attrition rate during this championship has not gone unnoticed. Five test matches in seven weeks, particularly given the intensity of the international game today, is enough to break bodies. Good job no-one has ever been daft enough to think out loud that five successive weekend Tests could be an option in the future.However, much of Scotlandrsquos woes have been self-imposed. Compared to  months ago, when we looked to score on any play, from any position, over the last few weeks we have collectively just ran up too many blind alleys. Yes, it all fell in to place latterly against England, but be honest, on another day wersquod have been crushed and left humiliated.Instead we werenrsquot, instead we left with a touch of optimism, and instead of pain, we left with that ancient silver pot, the Calcutta Cup.Moving pictures of Scotlandrsquos last victory at Twickenham are not quite in monochrome, more a slightly washed-out colour. The video tape should last a few more years before it breaks down to dust, through age. However, after our near- disintegration yesterday, we still live with the prospect of that historic recording decaying before we win again.Better teams than the one eventually selected by Gregor Townsend have biennially headed south, more in hope than honest belief in search of that illusive victory.

The debts have been repeatedly triggered in the plumbing scheme due to the high number of employers that have used it over the years.ldquoUnfortunately employer debt legislation is a case of well-intentioned legislation having unintended consequences because the sums of money employers are being asked to pay are quite large, she said.ldquoWe have a staggering amount of orphan liabilities, which relate to employers who are no longer contributing - about , employers in total have used the scheme.ldquoA debt is triggered when an employer winds up, goes insolvent or when their last employee leaves the scheme, but some that have triggered a debt may still be contributing to the scheme.ldquoA number of employers are very small and might only have one or two plumbers. They might have someone leave and then have a gap before someone  joins them - that gap would trigger a debt.Up until now the scheme has not collected any of these debts, with Ms Yates noting that its trustees, who had lobbied the Government for a change in the law, previously feltthe cost of doing so would be disproportionately high. They are looking to collect the debts now because the scheme, which has , members in Scotland and , in the rest of the UK, is expected to close to future accruals later this year.Fiona Hodgson, chief executive of the Scottish and Northern Ireland Plumbing Employersrsquo Federation , said the move has ldquonaturally raised serious concerns for our members.:Making a clear position on pensions.ldquoThe impact of Section  has the potential to be devastating for local businesses and the wider community, with the possibility of huge Section  debts looming over businesses who were simply trying to be good employers by providing a pension for their employees, she said.Affected businesses will start receiving demand letters between now and the end of June, although Ms Yates said that the scheme does not intend to collect every debt it issues a notice for. Where the sums are small, for example, it will be unlikely to seek payment.Meanwhile, the  firms that currently contribute to the pound billion scheme,  of which are based in Scotland, will have to find alternative pension arrangements for their employeesthe scheme closes to future accruals this summer as planned.Peter Mutch of law firm Aberdein Considine said that in addition to sourcing a defined contribution pension for their staff, employers will have to arrange benefits such as death in service cover that have until now been provided by the defined benefit scheme.Changes are being made to the pension because, while it has the funds to meet all its existing liabilities, contributions from non-retired members would have to rise signicantly in order for it to honour any further accruals.Trade union Unite is refusing to back the plan until it gets assurances about the level of contributions employers will pay into an alternative scheme.Its representative Bernard McAulay said: ldquoThis has been the jewel in the crown of pension schemes in the construction industry.ldquoOur members have contributed to it, they are very proud of it and itrsquos something they donrsquot want to lose.ldquoWersquore doing our best to make sure that what comes into being goes a long way to matching the industry standards."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-first-brexit-then-scoxit-what-leaving-the-eu-can-teach-us-about-scottish-independence","story":"The writer Will Self and the Tory MP Mark Francois were on BBC Politics Live to talk about the EU referendum but ended up trying to out-stare each other. Neither blinked and neither budged until, in the tradition of all pointless arguments between men, a woman intervened to break it up. Not only was it delightfully mad, it was a pretty good metaphor for the Brexit process: immovable, irrational, ridiculous, and a little bit childish. It was also a reminder that, on the endless, dficult subject of leaving the EU, we still havenrsquot found the man or woman we need to break up the fighting.:Paul Hutcheon: Brexit is a tragic plot line in a Tory soap operaIf there is any upside to be found in the whole thing , itrsquos this: the face-off between Leavers and Remainers could delay, and possibly frustrate, Brexit, although the longer-term consequences are still unclear. Over the weekend, we heard Nicola Sturgeon saythat the chaos of Brexit makes Scottish independence more likely. Her deputy Keith Brown also said the mess of Brexit might be the point at which momentum for independence becomes unstoppable. In other words, the SNP is hoping, still, that the Brexit chaos will drive voters into their arms.However, I wonderwe have really, properly looked for the clues in the chaos, the little signs to be found in the rubble, and asked what we can learn from them. The SNP keep arguing that the more people hate Brexit, the more they will love independence some unionists, on the other hand, argue Brexit is a clue to how hard negotiating Scottish independence will be. But letrsquos leave Mr Self and Mr Francois staring at each other for a minute shall we and take a look at the actual parallels between leaving the EU and leaving the UK. The picture is more mixed that you might think.Read more: Nicola Sturgeon signals Indyref push before For a start, the UK is not the same as the EU, although the dferences between them provide useful pointers. For instance ndash dficult as Brexit is ndash the fact that the UK is a sovereign state means it can leave the EU without having to make dficult decisions about what currency it uses for example it also doesnrsquot have to apply to join other international organisations or sort out its foreign or defence policies. All those questions have already been answered.Obviously, the same does not apply to Scotland ndash after voting for independence, it would be leaving a state rather than an organisation made up of states and would therefore have to make a lot of choices from scratch that the UK isnrsquot facing with Brexit. Scotland and rest of the UK also have shared assetsin a way that the UK and the EU donrsquot. All of this means, by definition, that Scotland leaving the UK would be more complicated than the UK leaving the EU, which, by extension, means the negotiations on independence could be even more hideous and confrontational than those on Brexit.Except in one happy respect: the dferences between the UK and the EU mean that there would, definitely, thankfully, be no equivalent to the backstop crisisScotland became independent because there isnrsquot a part of Scotland that would need to be treated dferently in the way Northern Ireland does. Scotland, geographically and politically, would be leaving the UK as a single whole country. Therefore, no Scottish backstop required, to the considerable relief of everyone.However, the absence of a backstop is not the same as an invisible border with England. Assuming Brexit goes ahead, the UK would be out of the single market and could restrict immigration from the EU. Equally, assuming Scotland joins the EU as an independent state, it would be following the four freedoms, including freedom of movement - therefore there would have to be checks at the Scottish border. Which leads to another of the lessons amid the chaos of Brexit: putting up barriers at borders is bad for the economy and the same would apply to Scotland.The other clues from the Brexit process are just as troubling, particularly on how the negotiations might go. Part of the problem for Theresa May has been that the EU is bigger and more powerful than the UK so the EU states have been able to dominate the negotiations and the same could apply to Scottish independence ndash the UK would be the bigger party and could end up imposing a deal thatrsquos bad for Scotland.Read more: Former Yes chief: Indyref coming down the trackAnd thatrsquos before we come to the political isions within Scotland itself. With Brexit, wersquove seen a minority government led by Mrs May thatrsquos paralysed by the split between hard and soft Brexiters and is reliant on a small party, the DUP, to get a deal through. But Nicola Sturgeon could find herself in a similar situation, except that the isions in her case would be between hard and soft nationalists arguing over how close to stay to the UK.Itrsquos also likely that, in trying to get any deal through Holyrood, the SNP would be reliant on a small party just as Mrs May is with the DUP, except that Mrs Sturgeon would be reliant on winning over hard nationalists in the Green party. The extreme Brexiters may have been the gremlins in the electrics of Brexit, but you can bet that,the SNP ever won a referendum on independence, there would be a similar type of hard Scottish nationalist pushing for an absolute form of separation. And the ldquoJacob Rees-Mogg in this situation, the ring-leader of the hard separatists, could be the leader of the Greens Patrick Harvie .All of these clues point to a dficult time after a vote for Scottish independence, quite apart from the fact that the dferences between the UK and the EU make another referendum dubious anyway ndash whatever Nicola Sturgeon and Keith Brown may have been hinting at over the weekend, the UK does not need permission to leave the EU, whereas Scotland has to get consent to leave the UK.Brexit has also taught us what happens when referendums are won by a slim margin. The argument goes on. Therersquos bitterness and chaos. The losers in the referendum keep pushing for another vote. The isions become deeper, and the wounds ooze more poison. This is precisely what has happened in the last two years over Brexit but take a close look at the chaos and you can see that itrsquos also what could happen to Scottish independence."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-leonard-targets-free-bus-travel-for-all-across-scotland","story":"The Scottish Labour leader reiterated his partys pledge ahead of a debate on the issue in Holyrood this Wednesday.:Blow for Richard Leonard as leak reveals , Labour membership slump across ScotlandAnalysis of Transport Scotland statistics suggested % of people who have taken a bus journey in the day before being questioned were on an annual income of less than pound,.Only % earned more than pound,.Mr Leonard hailed the introduction of free bus travel for over s, however only % of the surveys respondents had a concessionary travel pass.Mr Leonard said: \"Free bus travel for the over s, introduced by the last Labour government, has been one of the finest achievements of the Scottish Parliament.\"That is one reason why Labour wants to establish free bus travel for all, starting with extending the free bus pass to under s.:Why should travelling by bus be beneath those using Glasgow Airport \"This move would overwhelmingly benefit the poorest in our society, and make a real dference to the economy.\"Every pound spent on concessionary bus travel generates almost pound in benefits to those bus users and to the wider economy.\"Thats why we are bringing a debate on our policy to the Scottish Parliament this week.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9584069.jpg?type=article-full","title":"the-mystery-of-the-meteorite-that-struck-the-isle-of-lewis","story":"Rugged, remote and largely uninhabited, apart from the hunting-shooting set who descend on the exclusive Morsgail Estate Lodge and a handful of other holiday homes, there is little to disrupt the Hebridean peace and quiet.But it is also the scene of perhaps one of the most bizarre puzzles that islanders ndash and many others far beyond the shores ndash haveencountered.After all, itrsquos not every day that the area is gripped by reports that a mystery object ndash thought to be a meteorite, and for a while simply branded as ldquoThe Thing from Space ndash had plunged to earth.:Scientist believes first meteorite to hit British Isles landed in ScotlandOr, for that matter, that an entire loch suddenly disappears. It was  years ago this November when locals had noted the abundance of shooting stars and the aurora danced almost every night. While the wind blew hard there were occasional days bathed in winter sunshine and near-cloudless skies.At Aird Uig, the RAF early warning radar station, senior aircraftman James Watt had just lit a cigarette. He was off duty and yanked open the window of his billet to clear the smoke just in time.ldquoIt was a very strange incident, he reflects. ldquoAs far as I was able to tell at the time, I was the only person that saw it from beginning to end. It was fascinating.The jury is still out ndash even after six decades ndash as to what exactly happened. Events of the next few minutes would perplex even the brightest expert minds, lure the most revered stargazer of his age, Sir Patrick Moore, on a bone-rattling journey from his home to the Western Isles, and spark a still inconclusive debate as to what on earth caused a massive crater and a whole loch to be drained of every ounce of water.Mr Watt, , originally from Dundee and now living in North Lincolnshire, is convinced of what he saw and heard. ldquoIt was a lovely sunny morning, he begins.ldquoFirst off, it was asit was a dot, or a full stop in the sky. ldquoI thought lsquowhat on earth is that rsquo As I kept looking at it, this lsquofull stoprsquo got larger and larger. It was a large sphere or a ball that was black or dark grey with a trail of smoke behind it.The object shot past the camp, roaring loudly as it went, he adds.ldquoIt was travelling at an angle of deg to deg and passed around  yards from my billet and no more than ft above my head, then carried on over the horizon. I noticed a number of sparks coming from it and there was a heck of a roar, like an express train.It was so loud, the camprsquos commanding officer stopped in mid-shave, towel wrapped around his neck, and came outside to see what had happened.Mr Watt later described what hersquod seen as a ldquoburning ball of hell,not a meteorite then some strange ball of gas, which screamed beyond the camp in the direction of two nearby lochans that were popular fishing spots for his RAF colleagues.A reconnaissance party was gathered ndash Mr Watt included ndash to head towards the two lochans where the mystery object was thought to have landed.What they found was not entirely what they expected. He said: ldquoThe north lochan was nearest to the camp, and below that was another small lochan. We walked through the peat bog to where the top lochan should have been, but all we saw was mud and a gorge in the land where it had been. The north lochan was completely drained of water.The two lochans ndash Loch nam Learga to the north and Loch Mor Sheacuteilabridh to the south ndash were around  yards apart, but the team that scoured the site found no meteorite fragments, no signs of scorching and, strangely for Mr Watt, no dead fish.:Evidence of biggest meteorite to hit Britain found in ScotlandldquoWe walked around this mud patch and couldnrsquot see a single dead fish, there was no smell either, he adds. It took several days for news of the incident to find its way  miles north to Stornoway after a chance remark by a local postman who came across the drained lochan, large swathes of churned up bogland, and, he claimed, a whf of burning.According to reports at the time, the higher lochan ndash  yards long and around  yards wide, around  yards uphill from its neighbour ndash appeared to have a hole torn in its south bank, while the water seemed to have drained with such force that the land around looked asit had been subjected to an earthquake, with channels ft deep carved into the peat.The curious incident sparked lively speculation. Some thought a meteorite, others a lightning strike, a few suggested it could be a Russian rocket targeting the radar camp, while others plumped for flood damaged lochan banks suddenly giving way. Some newspaper reports even hinted at space travellers.To help solve the mystery, an astrophysicist from the Royal Observatory of Edinburgh visited the site on the Uig moor, while newspapers chartered planes to fly overhead, snapping pictures to send around the world. But even the expert was unsure of what he was looking at.ldquoThe possibility that the island of Lewis was hit by the biggest meteorite to land in Britain in living memory grew slimmer after a visit to the site by an astrophysicist from the Royal observatory, reported The Herald of December , .ldquoThe scientist, Dr Hugh E Butler, thought heavy rain was the likely cause of the upheaval, it continued, before adding that even he wasnrsquot sure. ldquoDr Butler reached no firm conclusion.He said: lsquoSomething  may have triggered it off. A meteorite cannot be ruled out but unless any fragments are found I donrsquot think for that investigation is justied.rsquoThe area between Morsgail Lodge and the hamlet of Kinreasort five miles away, was under increasing media interest. Reports of the incident soon reached America and Africa, and the East Grinstead home of Sir Patrick Moore.After a day travelling north to Inverness, Sir Patrick caught a flight to Stornoway and then travelled by road to Morsgail Lodge and on to the site. Reports of meteorites were, he suggested, science fiction. Instead, Sir Patrick plumped for the missing loch as being a case of serious subsidence with the possibility of a methane explosion which may have thrown rocks high into the air.A bog burst ndash when peat becomes so saturated that a landslide occurs ndash seemed to many to be the logical answer.Mr Watt, however, is among those who remain convinced that there was something more to the odd events of late November .Did whatever it was simply sink deep into the peat, hidden from view  And why was there not a single dead fish to be seen ldquoYou donrsquot forget something like that, he says. ldquoIt was exciting, unusual. Irsquod never seen anything like it before and Irsquove not seen it since."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9584549.jpg?type=article-full","title":"case-study-i-try-not-to-judge-people-harshly-i-was-like-that-once","story":"It had been a surprise when her daughter, Abigail, now three, was born with the condition and she admits it was overwhelming at first.\"A lot of people first of all say sorry,\" said Mrs McCoy, who also has a six-year-old son and a daughter aged one. \"I think people trying to be well-meaning, so I try not to judge people too harshly because a few years ago I didnt know any better myself.\"I had a mindset when Abigail was born of she wont achieve things, she might not live to be very old - now with experience, I realise thats not the case.\"Read more: Offensive terms like Mongol still widely used, warns Downs Syndrome charityMrs McCoy said her experience of health professionals had been mostly positive until she switched to a new GP after the family moved from Glasgow to Cambuslang.\"It was my first appointment and I was actually there to see about my little boy, not about Abigail,\" said Mrs McCoy, . \"Wed just moved house and hed got a bit stressed out by the upheaval, so I went to talk to the GP about it.\"She was an older woman, late s, early s.\"She said to me something like I can see why youre neurotic having a daughter like her in your le, referring to Abigail, and suggested that thats why I was really there.

This underlines the importance of the value we place on meeting our environmental obligations as we plan and construct new infrastructure. This book, which provides valuable details on the archaeological finds, will be essential reading for everyone who has an interest in the North-East’s history.”Bruce Mann, Archaeologist for the council, explained: “This book provides more details on our fascinating discoveries from the archaeological works carried out on the AWPR site. For instance, a very unexpected discovery was the presence of Roman activity at Milltimber, likely dating from around   AD. Ninety bread ovens were uncovered, which were probably constructed by the Roman army at a time of invasion led by the Roman General Agricola. However, no evidence of an associated camp was found, which is unusual for these types of features. We can only speculate as to why the ovens were in this location.“Going back to the very earliest finds, there was also evidence of stone tool production dating between about , and , BC at Milltimber, a near unprecedented body of evidence which pushes back our understanding of human activity in north east Scotland by several thousand years.”Bruce continued:“Bronze Age activity was identied from Nether Beanshill in the form of a roundhouse and contemporary cremation complex dating from around , to , BC. The burial comprised of an urn in which the cremated remains of an inidual in their s had been placed. This urn was placed in a pit which was then marked by a horseshoe-shaped arrangement of timber posts.

If cattle react aggressively, release your dog and take the shortest, safest route out of the field.The Scottish Outdoor Access Code website provides more information, including online video tutorials covering everything from teaching a dog to be relaxed around livestock through to dog walker etiquette and legal responsibilities.Dog behaviourist and trainer Natalie Light said: “These videos are packed full of great tips that will give dog owners the information and skills to have fun and safe walks in Scotland’s outdoors as well as understand their rights and responsibilities under the Scottish Outdoor Access Code.“I hope they encourage everyone to get involved and have the confidence to enjoy getting out and about with their pets this spring.”Farmers and other land managers are also encouraged to support responsible access with dogs by following the guidance in the Scottish Outdoor Access Code, for example by avoiding putting sheep close to lambing in fields with well-used routes, or indicating reasonable alternatives. If necessary, local access officers can also provide advice.More information is available on the Scottish Outdoor Access Code website.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Remember, it is the most important day’s work in any farmer’s year.”• Online applications can be submitted via the Scottish Government#s rural payments and services website, at www.ruralpayments.org.A paper copy of the Single Application Form can be picked up at the Scottish Government#s office, in the Government Buildings, on Junction Road, Kirkwall. Paper forms can be handed there, or sent to: Scottish Government, Agriculture and Rural Economy, Government Buildings, Tankerness Lane, Kirkwall, KW AQ.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The leboat’s entire crew of eight lost their lives as they selflessly headed towards the cargo ship.The crew lost were: coxswain Daniel Kirkpatrick, nd coxswain James Johnston, bowman Ray Kirkpatrick, mechanic Robert Johnston, assistant mechanic James Swanson, and crew Jack Kirkpatrick, Robert Johnston and Eric McFadyen.Longhope RNLI and Longhope Leboat Museum Trust have in recent months, been in the process of preparing for the commemorative events marking  years since the loss of the T.G.B. and her gallant crew.Those events will take place both on land and at sea today, including at the Longhope Leboat Museum, the former leboat shed in Brims, where Longhope leboats were based for many years, before being based at Longhope Pier.Commemorations will also take place in front of the Longhope Leboat Memorial at Osmundwall, and at the YM Hall, Longhope.It is planned that a flotilla of boats, including RNLI leboats from Thurso, Stromness, Wick, and the current Longhope Leboat, plus the Coastguard tug Ievoli Black, an Orkney Harbours tug, pilot boat, and vintage leboat from Ireland, will congregate in Aith Hope, to lower their flags as a mark of respect. The Coastguard will also be represented by one of their rescue helicopters.Flags at leboat stations around Scotland, the RNLI’s Divisional Base in Perth, and at the RNLI’s HQ in Poole will be lowered to half mast.Coverage will appear online on The Orcadian Facebook page today, and in a special supplement in The Orcadian, out on Thursday.Local company Cloudnet IT Solutions also plan to livestream aspects of the events live at: https:livestream accounts  TGBLonghope vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

No amount of fiddling about works, switch them off and on and often the problem is solved.This is where we are now with Brexit. If it is ever to be delivered at all the process needs to be rebooted.This week there is likely to be a third opportunity for MPs to pass the Prime Minister’s Withdrawal Agreement so she can claim we are leaving the EU after all,only at the end of June rather than the end of March as she personally “guaranteed”. Those MPs that believe Brexit is desirable and wish to achieve it should vote it down again – and they should vote it down at each and every opportunity it is presented for endorsement.I know there are a growing number of MPs that have voted against the Withdrawal Agreement in the past who are now changing their minds and reluctantlysupporting it in the hope they can deal with its problems afterwards. They just want to get over the line and “leave” on th March, intending to claim they have met their promises on Brexit. I believe they are well meaning but through desperation are naively being taken in or are fooling themselves.Theresa May’s agreement is so bad it is actually worse than remaining an EU member under current membership terms. We will not be able to leave the agreement without EU approval Northern Ireland will be treated dferently from the rest of the UK the jurisdiction of European Courts shall remain superior regulations and restrictions of the EU’s single market and customs union will continue our fishing grounds will be included in negotiations again – and we’ll continue to pay billions into the EU on top of the £bn no court of arbitration would recommend we pay.If the Withdrawal Agreement is passed it shall then be presented as an example of brilliant leadership by the prime minister against all odds. We shall never stop hearing of her resilience, fortitude, dedication and perseverance in praise of her premiership. She will believe she should carry on and, believe me, there will be figures that will push for her to stay, as it shall be advantageous to them. Fortunately the truth will out. If she is allowed to stay and run the next negotiations they shall be just as disastrous. Nor will it take long for the agreement to unravel. I suspect most of the public is unaware that the Withdrawal Agreement is not a final “deal” but provides only a transition period for leaving. Its twenty-one month trade talks will be worse than the past two years since Article  was invoked. Having paid over our billions and accepted the unnecessary Irish backstop we shall have little negotiating leverage to protect our industries and our interests. The bullying and scare stories shall heighten economic uncertainty and eat into business confidence.Old and new kites shall be flown to wrong foot our negotiators about access to our fisheries unless another trade-off is given Gibraltar will be raised with malevolent intent to keep us in our place, while the threat of taxes on our financial servicescan become a reality. The backstop will not be solved for it is ​insoluble without EU agreement. The point is there is no repairing the Withdrawal Agreement. The only way to break the cycle, to clear the frozen screen before us is to refuse to agree to any deal.The legal position is thatan exit agreement acceptable to the EU cannot be signed-off by parliament the UK must leave the EU on Friday  March without one. We shall then have to use the many mini deals already in place for aviation, visa-free travel, nuclear power, haulage licences and all the rest.It is unlikely the EU will grant a short extension of Article  until the end of June because it is not intent on negotiating any more, it has no incentive to do so because the UK leaving without an agreement has been taken off the table. It will undoubtedly offer a long extension of around two years, possibly infor us providing a referendum, and certainly at great financial cost. It will mean fighting the European Parliament elections, which shall undoubtedly deliver carnage upon the Tory party and revive the career of Nigel Farage.Only voting the Withdrawal Agreement down can reset the negotiations. What is there to lose by rejecting it again and waiting to see what extension is offered and what the EUs price is  Agreeing to “the Deal” will not deliver Brexit, but rejecting it can.Some MPs might find the price of extension too high and can conclude it is better to leave on the th, ending the uncertainty and resetting the negotiations from outside the EU but in a much more favourable position. Alternativelya long delay in leaving is forced upon pro-Brexit MPsthen what was once worth fighting for before must surely be worth fighting for again too  That the challenge has become a longer game should not put people off from achieving the best result.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon accuses theresa may of undermining holyrood over dup brexit deal","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has accused Theresa May of undermining the Scottish Parliament and \"shortchanging\" Scots public spending over Brexit in a damning letter to the Prime Minister.The SNP leader has hit out at the prospect of the Democratic Unionist Partybeing allowed a seat at the Brexit trade talks in a bid by Mrs May to to secure the passage of her Brexit deal in Parliament and avoid an extension to Article .

I value all public sector workers and I thank them for the work that they do.“On the police pay award - that is the best award for police officers anywhere in the UK and the Scottish Police Federation said it was the best award in  years.”She added: “If the member thinks . per cent is not good enough... then I wonder what he makes of the two per cent that has been awarded to police officers in England by his Tory colleagues in the Westminster government, I think described by the head of the Met as a punch in the nose for police officers ”Later, Mr Simpson said the First Minister should apologise for her remarks in Holyrood.He said: “Nicola Sturgeon should be taking the concerns of a serving police officer extremely seriously. Instead, in front of Scotland’s parliament, she branded him a disgrace.“It’s no wonder officers are losing faith in this SNP government with that kind of attitude. These brave and hardworking police officers should not be discriminated against because they don’t threaten to go on strike.“The First Minister needs to apologise for being so dismissive of his concerns.”In the letter, the anonymous officer said: “Why has such a massive importance been placed on the pay rise for school teachers when other public service staff are not being awarded nearly as much as a pay rise “Does the Scottish Government place the value of police officers as only half that of school teachers  Is it that the Government know that because police officers cannot strike or take any real industrial action that they are an easy target ”A spokesman for the First Minister later said that she would not apologise as her \"disgraceful\" comment was not directed at the police officer but at Graham Simpson.During First Ministers Questions, Mr Simpson was booed by SNP backbenchers as he read out the letter, and asked what Nicola Sturgeon would say to the officer and “thousands of others” like him.Ms Sturgeon went on to say: “In terms of our NHS workers many get higher pay in Scotland than they do in England because of the value we attach to the work that they do.“In terms of teachers they have now been offered an exceptionally good pay deal and I think that is recognition of the good work that they do and I hope that is now accepted.“But I value all public sector workers and I thinkyou look at any group of public sector workers you will find that the value attached to them by the Scottish Government is much much greater than the value attached to their counterparts in England by the Tory government at Westminster.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"royal mile treasure trove of mary queen of scots documents found","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A treasure trove of documents signed by Mary Queen of Scots and revealing the #everyday reality of ruling the country# in the th century has been unearthed in a council storage facility on the Royal Mile.A haul of handwritten papers is said to show the doomed monarch “carefully managing the busy commercial le of Edinburgh”, as well as authorising the building of new defences for the city in Leith.The documents, which are set to be the centrepiece of a new exhibition in Edinburgh on Mary’s short-lived rule, have already been conserved and digitised to allow them to be viewed publicly on the council’s online archive. They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

They then went on to highlight some of the key tenets underpinning the debate such as trade agreements, law and immigration, before making their concluding statements.In the opening gambit for the pro-Brexit team, S pupil Abbi Morgan argued that leaving the EU #would be a hugely positive thing for the UK# and would allow the country to #take control of borders and create worldwide trade agreements#.She went on to add that it would put the UK in a position to #take back its sovereignty# and make its own decisions on important matters. She stated that as a net contributor to the EU, the UK would be better off by £. billion.In the opening address for the pro-EU team, Lois Langlandssaid that #history and past experience as a member of the EU# gave the UK a more secure position for the future and that, in leaving the European Union, the UK would #enter the unknown# and #walk into the future blindfolded#.She said that outside the EU the UK was a #small fish in a big pond# and asked why any country would be interested in providing a free trade agreement with the UK.#The EU as an organisation is extremely wasteful#, he said. #Every  days the European Parliament moves from Brussels to Strasbourg, where it sits for four days # this is estimated to cost nearly £ million a year.#Touching on the issues of freedom of movement as part of the remain team, Chiara MacLeansaid: #Once the UK leaves the EU, British citizens will become third-party nationals, with no automatic right of admission.# She added that, through the new European travel information and authorisation system, all UK nationals over  years of age #would have to pay money to go somewhere they had a free right to go now#.Seth Bennettook up the reins for the pro-Brexit side, arguing that in terms of laws and immigration the EU could pass any laws they wanted and in by doing so #strip Britain of its sovereignty# # which he described as #one of its driving forces#.He believed that Brexit would offer the UK the chance to #increase its spending in education and housing# which could perhaps lead to a #revival of the nation#s once-thriving industries#.Speaking for the pro-EU team, Gracie Buchan said that leaving the European Union would lead to a trade deficit and result in a shortage of daily supplies such as fruit and vegetables.#Keeping food shop shelves full and prices down will be one of the biggest challenges when Brexit comes around,# she said. #Failure to reach some sort of an agreement could see retailers face an average increase of  per cent, particularly in dairy, meat, veg, and fruit.#Closing for the Brexit side, S pupil Joseph Moller said the EU favoured its own agenda and that in terms of per head of population Maltese citizens had  times more representation than UK nationals.He added that, rather than the , jobs that were cited as potentially being lost due to Brexit, the level of employment had in fact risen by one per cent since the referendum and unemployment was at its lowest level since the s.Summing up for remain, S pupil Innes MacNeil said: #Latest reports suggest that deals have been struck with just seven out of  countries, we have gained a lot more than we have spent on the EU, and multinational companies are threatening to relocate overseas, affecting jobs and investments.#Exiting in less than  days# time without any sound withdrawal agreement and just a few trade relationships will result in uncertainty and chaos.#The judges said they were impressed by how confident and informed the pupils were. They also felt the pupils were cohesive as a team and said that they saw some future MSPs and MPs.In the end, the judges awarded the team speaking against Brexit  points while the side advocating Brexit received  to claim victory.Skye, Lochaber, and Badenoch MSP Kate Forbes and Highland and Islands MSP Edward Mountain both fielded questions on Brexit after the debate and were quick to praise the pupils for their efforts.Ms Forbes said: #I certainly think they could have resolved Brexit faster than some of the politicians today # an absolutely fantastic debate based on fact, evidence, respect for each other, lots of confidence. I think I have left with a few top tips for my next debate in parliament!#Mr Mountain added: #I thought it was quite excellent # there#s obviously a lot of research gone into it. I thought they were extremely confident # I would have been much more nervous than that speaking at their age. As I said to Kate Forbes today, she should be worried because there are a few challenges for her position.#"},{"url":null,"title":"st patrick s barracks green light for major housing and leisure

Also little ones can get creative and make a sheep brooch, a rainbow mobile or a snake to take home on the day as well as having their face painted.You might even get the opportunity to get a selfie with St Patrick himself.As well as the “flesh and blood” version the entertainment hub will be host to a beautul hand carved wooden statue of the one-time Slemish shepherd.It was carved by Miguel Frederico Neves and stands over ft tall.There will be no parking at Slemish, Carnstroan Road or Carnstroan Lane, so a free park and ride service will operate from the former Michelin plant, Broughshane, just off the M.The shuttle bus to Slemish Mountain will run continually from am – :pm stopping in Broughshane village so nobody will miss out on the free entertainment and shopping offers.The one and a half kilometre walk at Slemish takes approximately one hour up and down and it is strongly advised that suitable clothing and strong footwear is worn.Sections of the short climb can be steep and slippery and might not be suitable for all.For those who would enjoy an easier trek than Slemish, a gentle riverside walk from Raceview Mill takes visitors past the Raceview hedgehog habitat and along the beautul river Braid as it meanders around the village. Come rain or shine, Broughshane and District Community Association will be providing the hub of entertainment on Saturday  March with fun for all the family to enjoy.

She said: “The council contacted me to askI would be happy to make some gts and when I found out who it was for my jaw dropped.“Its not often you get an opportunity like that and it was such an honour for me to make something special for the Royal couple.”Vera said the response to her jewellery has been “amazing” and she has received calls from all over the world.She explained: “Once it became known that I made the gts I got calls from America, Australia, Canada and Africa. The phone hasnt stopped. I have also had wonderful support locally with everyone congratulating me.”Vera, who is inspired by her love of nature, has been designing, making and restoring jewellery for over  years.Born in the Czech Republic Vera, moved to London where she worked for four years at Hatton Garden Jewellers.Vera met her husband in London and after a couple of years the couple decided to move to Northern Ireland.Vera set up her own studio and has been hard at work designing and creating bespoke jewellery.

The scheme has provided an opportunity for The Carson Project, Dunclug Youth Forum and Doury Road Development Group to explore the potential of working together to help embed good relations and peace building at a local level and to build upon work done to date.One member of the audience, better qualied than most in terms of judging audience response at The Braid is Council Arts Officer Rosalind Lowry and she admitted she was blown away by the performance and the audience reaction.What a fantastic atmosphere, she said. The BRAID project organisers deserve huge congratulations for the concert - it was fabulous.And the appreciation was not a one-way street with Garda band leader Pat Kenny saying: Im delighted everyone enjoyed the concert.The warmth that came from the audience was something I will cherish for a very long time. Please give my regards to all and God willing we will all meet again.Sandy Wilson of North Antrim Community Network echoed the thoughts of many who attended when he made special mention of Ballymenas Colum Best, a major driving force behind the evening.He said: Congratulations - mainly to youfor your vision about hosting the concert and to the other community people involved.It was a truly enjoyable and memorable evening for everyone and i think two standing ovations at the end said it all. We really enjoyed the singers as well , they really added to the talent and iety of the musical performance. Well done to all ! Colum admitted he was almost overwhelmed by the response. He told the : It was out of this world and people leaving at end of night were saying that it was the best concert they had ever been at. “I have never seen an audience cheer as loud or stand up to applaud so much .. the place was really rocking.

Happily, a full scheme of restoration is now underway. The first phase will see the building of new chimneys, the replacement of the roof and rainwater goods and repairs to the windows. The building is historically very signicant as it was a purpose built shop constructed for the Settlement in . It is two storey with attics and basement and the layout is much as it was when originally constructed. The central shop area still contains many original features including shelving built into the walls, counters and a large wooden winch wheel for drawing stores up to the attic. Speaking about the restoration David Johnston, chairman of the Trust said: The aim is to restore this unique building so visitors can once again experience what le might have been like in the nineteenth century. “Holiday accommodation with a period theme will also be provided and a tea room will complete the scheme to ensure the future of this wonderful and historic building and hopefully the roof will be good for another  years!

It honours the UK’s solemn commitments in the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.“If we ever have to use that insurance policy, it cannot become a permanent arrangement and it is not a template for our future relationship.“The deal that MPs voted on in January was not strong enough in making that clear and legally-binding changes were needed to set that right. We have now agreed them.“The EU cannot act with the intent of applying the backstop indefinitely which can be challenged.“Now it is time to come together and back this improved deal.” Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the new agreements were an “unambiguous statement” of both sides’ “good faith and intentions” but also made it clear they did not undermine the principle of the backstop.“We have insisted that the Withdrawal Agreement could not be rewritten, and that the backstop arrangement, while intended to be temporary, must continue to apply unless and until it is replaced by future arrangements that can achieve the same objective, namely no hard border,” he said.“However, we have also said that we were prepared to offer guarantees and further reassurances and to the UK of our good faith and intentions – indeed we have offered such reassurances on many occasions.“The Instrument agreed yesterday puts those assurances on a legal footing and represents an unambiguous statement by both parties of what has been agreed. “It does not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, or undermine the backstop or its application. “It says that we will work together, in good faith, in pursuit of a future relationship that ensures that the objectives of the Protocol, particularly the need to avoid a hard border, are met. “The documents agreed yesterday reiterate our wish to establish a future partnership with the UK that is as close as possible, and marks our commitment to ensure that negotiations on that future relationship can begin as soon as the UK leaves. “The instrument agreed sets out how we will go about this important work. “In many ways, Brexit has been a dark cloud over us for many months, and particularly the threat of no deal. A positive vote tonight can remove that cloud and restore confidence and optimism in Britain, Ireland and across the European Union. “We now need to see the Withdrawal Agreement ratied by Westminster and by the European Parliament without further delay, so that we can get on with the important work of building the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, and between the UK and Ireland, post Brexit. “I know feel that for the remains of the day, we need to give MPs in Westminster the time and space to consider what#s now on the table.” All eyes now turn to UK Attorney General Geoffrey Cox who will later today give his considered assessment of whether what Mrs May has secured is legally binding. His response is expected to be key in deciding what way Brexit hardliners – notably Jacob Rees-Mogg’s ERG and the DUP – will vote this evening.

But now, it seems the only paths are to see a catastrophic no deal outcome, the Government working across the House of Commons to find a softer version of Brexit, or reconsidering Brexit in its entirety,# she said.“In the short run, taking a no deal off the table must be the immediate priority. In itself and without a clear plan, this resolves nothing. The House of Commons is good at saying what it is against, but can’t manage to give a clear answer on what it is for. But the UK is too close to the clf-edge and every day of uncertainty sees more and more economic and social damage.“The clearest, most coherent and most democratic route through this impasse lies with a People’s Vote, including both the Prime Minister’s deal and the Remain option. This needs to be tested in Parliament as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sentence overturned for man carrying flag","story":"AN IRSP activist who was convicted for carrying a flag during a Falls Road Easter commemoration has had his sentence overturned.In December last year, West Belfast man Sean Carlin was given a four-month suspended sentence for carrying a historical replica of an INLA Belfast Battalion flag during the commemoration in .The parade had been themed to honour local members who had lost their lives during attacks on the organisation following a  split. However, in what is believed to be the first case of its kind, Sean was subsequently arrested and convicted under the Terrorism Act  for carrying the flag in circumstances that state authorities deemed to arouse suspicion that he is a member or supporter of a proscribed organisation.This week, Sean revealed that his suspended sentence had been quashed with a £ fine issued in its stead following a court appeal against the earlier ruling.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Sean said: “From the start of this I was of the opinion that no matter what the outcome of the case was that I was going to be fighting it. If I was convicted, and eventually was convicted, then the benchmark was set and would have big repercussions for republicans right across the board. The point we made was that this was a commemorative event. It was advertised as a commemorative event so we were trying to unravel the agenda of the PPS and the cops.“We’ve been of the opinion that, this is all because we didn’t buy into the Fresh Start Agreement,” he added.“The IRSP has been getting hounded since then. This flag issue was just another signicant push in relation to criminalising the IRSP. On a personal level, I couldn’t accept carrying a flag to commemorate your dead being a criminal offence – it’s unheard of.”Sean’s solicitor, Michael Brentnall, said that while the case has “set the benchmark” in terms of sentencing, the legislation surrounding the conviction stands to be challenged.“I think it’s signicant, particularly the judges remarks at the end, who stated that no person in Ireland should go to jail for carrying a flag in Ireland. That’s signicant in itself and it has set the benchmark for how these matters be dealt with. We’re now seeking senior council’s opinion on whether there is a point of law that can be taken to the court of appeal on the basis of the conviction alone rather than just the sentence.” He continued: “Each case is facts specic, but in Sean’s case it was said during proceedings that every case of somebody carrying a similar flag to a commemoration could be criminalised. Sean was the only person this had been enforced against – there’s an issue with that in itself, but then Sean’s barrister made the point that this was a clear breach of freedom of expression and the sanction was entirely excessive in relation to the context of what had happened.”He added: “Another point that we still have to explore is that the legislation is very vague. The legislation says that you can be a supporter or a member of a proscribed organisation.

The peers also said there was an acknowledgement that there are circumstances in which the backstop could \"undercut\" the Good Friday Agreement rather than protect it. Former Ulster Unionist leader Lord Trimble, now a Tory peer, won the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in securing the Agreement. MPs rejected the revised package by  votes last week, but the peers said the changes secured with the EU had improved its chances of getting through Parliament, in part because of \"widespread war weariness on all sides\". In a paper for the centre-right Policy Exchange think tank they said: \"Not a word of MrsMays withdrawal agreement of November , so heavily defeated twice in Parliament, has been changed. \"But we are now closer to acceptance of the same agreement. \"A widespread war weariness on all sides is a signicant factor. \"But the Government has succeeded in securing substantive changes that will affect and limit the impact of the Irish backstop,it is ever put in place at the end of the transitional period. \"The chances of the Prime Minister getting the deal through Parliament have improved.\"Earlier, Philip Hammond rejected claims the Government is offering extra cash to Northern Ireland to get the DUP to back Mays Brexit deal. The Chancellor said \"thats not where the discussion has been at all\", although he acknowledged funding issues would come up in the forthcoming spending review. Mr Hammond, who was involved in talks with DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds on Friday, said the discussions had focused on preventing a regulatory border in the Irish Sea. Persuading the  DUP MPs to back the deal is viewed as crucial by ministers as they believe allaying their concerns about the backstop will help swing Tory Eurosceptics behind the Prime Minister. One option being considered is a \"Stormont lock\" written into law so that any new regulations imposed on Northern Ireland would either be adopted by the entire UK or not at all, the Sunday Times reported. Mr Dodds is also reportedly looking for a cut in air passenger duty, which is lower in the Republic than Northern Ireland. The Government may also have to find another £bn to secure a further two years to the confidence and supply arrangement which underpins Mrs Mays minority administration in the Commons. On BBCs Andrew Marr Show, Mr Hammond said: \"I regard it as crucially important that we do not allow dferences to grow up between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\"And were looking for ways in which the Government can reassure Northern Irish politicians about our clear intention to make sure that there are no such dferences as we go forward,the backstop ever had to come into force.\" He added: \"This isnt about money. Its about a political assurance - well, look, we are coming up to a spending review and we will have to look at all budgets, including devolved block-grant budgets, in that spending review, of course we will.\"In a statement on Saturday, the DUP said: \"We are in discussions with the Government to ensure Northern Ireland is not separated out from the rest of the United Kingdom as we leave the European Union. \"Contrary to some reports, we are not discussing cash. \"There are still issues to be addressed in our discussions.\""},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say march","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As coach Liam Dwyer told the Press Association of the game: “Yeah, it has some signicant history doesn’t it ”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  “Everyone at home likes to beat the Germans because of the World Cup!” said midfielder and forward Tom Ward from St Albans.Meanwhile for Reece Johnson, a midfielder, the chance to get involved in the rivalry in a competition fixture was welcome.“Whenever England play Germany it’s always a big game,” he said. “So it felt good to have a good competitive game against them.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Meanwhile the quality of both teams means that comparisons between the international scene and the Special Olympic arena are valid – while this GB team are one of the favourites for gold, Germany represent one of their trickiest challenges.“I knew the game was going to be tough because Germany are quite a good team, quite tough, so it was a physical game,” said Derek Taylor.Indeed, a - result full of big tackles and a late flurry of chances confirmed how evenly matched these sides were in the seven-a-side arena.“I’m very happy with the draw,” said goalkeeper Sean McCulloch. “This was the hardest gameI would think at the moment.”Game  of the group @SOGreatBritain - SO Germany. Two very organised teams that cancelled each other out. If we don’t lose our next game we will be playing for gold! Aussies are up next!— Bobby ColtmanMarch , But while plenty of the rivalry seems to translate to this World Games fixture, the Special Olympics movement gives it its own flavour, combining a will to win with respect and the forging of new relationships.“We showed respect for them, handshakes at the end of the match,” said McCulloch, who swapped one of his World Games badges with an opponent at full time.“It doesn’t matter what rivalry it is. As long as everybody’s together.”Meanwhile, those sentiments were reflected in the crowd of friends, family and fans who were sat together watching from the stand.“In the crowd the German supporters and the British supporters were all having a laugh together, chanting together and all sorts,” said Ward’s father Steve. “There was no animosity. It was just a friendly atmosphere and it’s the same with the players. They all came off together – not as two teams, but together.”And while building new friendships doesn’t necessarily take priority over victories, make no mistake: there is more than one way to leave this tournament a winner.“I think we’ve got a very good chance of winning gold,” said Johnson. “But evenwe don’t, we’ve made new friends and that’s what matters.”"},{"url":null,"title":"man attempts to smuggle three tortoises disguised as pastries","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Having such high-tech equipment available locally would mean many people from the area would not have to travel long distances to have their tests carried out where, Mr McGrath continued.ldquoSuch a scan can be a worrying time and the fact that people have to travel to other places for the scan adds to the anxiety.Cllr Trainor said a mobile scanner currently in place at the Downe to ease pressure at the Ulster Hospital will only be there for a few more weeks.ldquoDoes this fact not make the business case for the local health trust, too many people using the current scanner at the Ulster so one is required at the Downe  he asked.ldquoI hope local health officials will hurry up with their administrative work required to progress the business case to provide an MRI scanner in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"City deals could bring finanacial boost for Newcastle  ","story":"PLANS to deliver a signicant multi-million pound tourism bonanza in Newcastle have taken an important step forward this week.Highly ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in the resort are among the key projects included in Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos bid for a share of poundbn investment package under the Belfast City Regional Deal.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is one of five councils paired with Belfast City Council, universities and the private sector which have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes, with the remainder of the cash coming from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.On Monday, members of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee agreed to sign a heads of agreement deal which paves the way for work to start on outline business cases and financial plans for ious components of the city deal which includes the Mournes Gateway project.Local authority officials are expected to work with Tourism NI to help deliver the ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle which include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes.The proposal is one of a series of exciting, world class attraction proposals, including an ultra-modern visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It is being suggested that work on the business case and financial plans could take around one year to complete, with the ious proposals delivered with the help of a range of funding partners to signicantly increase the number of visitors to the resort.And while the main focus is on the major aspects of the tourism initiative mdash which also include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy and an indoor activity centre in Donard Park mdash there are many other components.The Newcastle tourism project was a key part of the city deal which has secured a near poundbn investment package from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.Newry, Mourne and Down is hoping to secure poundm from the Northern Ireland Executive and is committing poundm of ratepayersrsquo money to fund the proposed gondola ride and visitor centre.And while talks continue to secure cash under the city deal initiative, local council officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for its other aspects and move the ious projects through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.The tourism schemersquos other proposals include an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Consultants appointed by the local authority to look at developing the resortrsquos visitor infrastructure have also come up with proposals for the Islands Park, with upgrades planned for existing car parks, alongside new public toilet provision. There are also proposals to reduce the the tree line in Donard Forest on the slopes of the Mournes.A so-called lsquogreen travel networkrsquo which would allow visitors to hire bicycles and electric bikes to make their way round ious attractions is also suggested.The ious proposals form the core of the so-called Mourne Mountains Gateway Study and have already been discussed with the National Trust, Forest Service and Environment Agency.Before anything happens, numerous planning and environmental approvals will be required, alongside the compilation of feasibility studies and business cases.The overarching vision of the gateway project is to provide game-changing, world-class, international tourist attractions which develop sustainable enhancement of access from Newcastle to the Mournes and its foothills and forests, while also broadening recreational provision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Coney Island singer Jayne looking for support to produce new album  ","story":"FROM Coney Island, to Nashville and on to Vancouver, musician Jayne Trimble has travelled many miles to get to where she is today.The folk musician is heading to Los Angeles next month to record her third album mdash that isshe can raise at least , Canadian dollars mdash thatrsquos pound, mdash to cover initial production costs.The former Down High student is asking local people, and women in particular, to support her Kickstarter campaign to record the album Your Mother Was A Peacock.While Jaynersquos vocals are hauntingly soft, she describes her latest music as ldquovisceral and epic.She is recording the new album, which will be produced by Damien Jurado, under the name Oxlip mdash which is an Irish wildflower.ldquoItrsquos my most ambitious and exciting album to date, explained the  year-old. ldquoItrsquos a collection of songs based on the lives of women throughout history who have either been scapegoated, or were just plain tragic.

There is also concern about the surface of the existing car park which is particularly uneven and the absence of adequate parking for visitors with young families.The access from the car park to the beach for families pushing prams is described as ldquounsuitable with the financial spend approved at Mondayrsquos meeting designed to improve the overall visitor experience, create a better first impression, improve the car park surface and the number of available spaces.New directional signs are also proposed, with council officials warning failure to address the issues could result in the loss of blue flag status, result in a negative visitor experience, reduced visitor numbers and income.To progress the improvement work, council officials have agreed to appoint a contractor to design a scheme.The planned investment has been welcomed by Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran.He said he was pleased local authority officials have recognise the need to improve Tyrella to ensure it continues to attract a high number of visitors, particularly from April and September.ldquoTyrella is an extremely popular beach, he said. ldquoIt is highly regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos top beaches and it is vital it retains its blue flag status. We rely heavily upon tourism in our area and we need to ensure our beaches are up to standard.Cllr Curran says he has no doubt that investing in Tyrella is not only ldquogood news for the district and visitors to the area, but will produce an economic idend through increased use.He continued: ldquoWe are fortunate to have stunning beaches like Tyrella, Kilclief and Ballyhornan on our doorstep. Those who work to keep our bathing waters clean and, more importantly, up to an internationally recognised standard so they are safe to use, do a terric job.Cllr Curran said picturesque beaches helped make up the ldquounique fabric of Lecale and the surrounding area and were a vital tourism resource.He added: ldquoThe planned investment at Tyrella is a good news story and I am pleased that the local authority is not content to sit back on its laurels but recognises the importance of continuing investment in a wealth of tourism assets right across the entire district.ldquoDown District is lucky to be blessed with such priceless resources which can make a valuable contribution to the health and well-being of our local communities and visitors alike. It is essential that we continue to strive for the very highest of standards across all our facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Derry Girls fun in Ballyhornan  ","story":"THE hit comedy series Derry Girls is putting Ballyhornan on the map.The Wee Shop in the small coastal village will be featured in one of the upcoming storylines of the much-anticipated second series.Viewers will see Game of Thrones actor Ian McElhinney and comedian Tommy Tiernan as Granda Joe and Da Gerry go off on some undisclosed caper in Burt, Co Donegal.Part of the newsagentrsquos shop and cafe was transformed into a grungy taxi office for two days of filming which took place at the end of last October.The Cable Bar, which is just feet away from the shop, is also featured in the scene.With old petrol pumps outside the shop, vintage tractors and an ice-cone sign, the Wee Shop looked authentic for the filming and should spark nostalgia for viewers of Donegal holidays for years past.The five young teens which star in the surprise Netflix hit set in s Derry mdash actors Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Nicola Coughlan, Jamie-Lee OrsquoDonnell, Dylan Llewellyn and Louisa Harland mdash were not involved in the filming.Channel rsquos Derry Girls, written by Lisa McGee, attracted an average two million audience per episode for its first series last year.

They came in and created a stud wall and painted the walls brown on the bottom and cream on the top and then distressed it to make it look as it had years of smoke on it.ldquoWith the ious props and bits and pieces, it really looked the part, he added.Brendan revealed that it was pure fate that led to the producers to ask to film there.He also insisted that the programme retained the shoprsquos name.ldquoA couple of guys were just out and about scouting around and thought that my shop was just what they were after for that scene, he explained.ldquoWhen they came in to discuss the matter, it turned out that one of the worked for me when I was a bar manager years ago up north.ldquoThey reimbursed me for two days of business and I felt that was fine because Irsquom hoping that there may be a spin-off for me with new customers once the programme airs.bull Episode three of Derry Girls airs on Tuesday at .pm on Channel ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Designer meets with Duchess again during Empire Bar visit  ","story":"SAINTFIELD fashion designer Meabh Mageean has the ear mdash and the eye mdash of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.The  year-old was lucky to meet the Duchess for the second time when she visited Belfast with her husband recently.It was natural that their chat turned to weddings and clothes, given that one is regarded as the best-dressed Royal in the world and the other is an up and coming fashion designer.Meabh had been asked to meet the Duchess at an celebration of achievement of young people at the Empire bar.She had previously met with her last February at a fashion event in Buckhingham Palace.ldquoI was asked to meet and talk to the Duchess about that event and my own work, explained Meabh.ldquoShe was interested to know what I brought back from last yearrsquos event andit enhanced my business.

No one thought this was going to happen.Mrs Trainor believes the Downe is capable of accommodating both ENT day surgery and the proposed cataract service, given that it is relatively modern hospital, boasting a range of high tech, diagnostic equipment and theatres.She added: ldquoIt simply beggars belief that we are to lose a key day surgery for people with ear, nose and throat problems. The loss is compounded by the fact that local hospital campaigners were not informed this was happening or asked for their views.Last week, a South Eastern Trust spokeswoman confirmed there were no plans to reduce the number of ENT sessions delivered at the Downpatrick hospital.She added: ldquoThe Trust is planning to increase ENT clinics at the Downe and to relocate an ENT day surgery session from Downpatrick to the Lagan Valley Hospital to facilitate the cataract elective care centre prototype work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Farmers opposed to geopark plans  ","story":"PLANS to secure world renowned tourism branding for an area stretching from Strangford Lough to South Armagh have been dealt a major blow this week.As Newry, Mourne and Down Council prepares to submit a bid to secure prestigious UNESCO geopark status for an area taking in the Mournes, Ring of Gullion and the Strangford and Lecale Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the Ulster Farmersrsquo Union has labelled the proposal a ldquonon starter.Consultants have been working on the councilrsquos bid for geopark status ahead of a formal application being made this November.Supporters of the ambitious plan insist that securing geopark status is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.Geopark branding is one of the key planks of the local authorityrsquos tourism strategy with those involved in the process confident it has the potential to increase the number of international visitors to the area.However, the Ulster Farmersrsquo Union mdash whose representatives met recently with local authority officials and representatives from Geological Survey NI mdash says farmers are ldquounanimously opposed to the geopark.While it has been suggested that securing geopark branding could potentially be worth in the region of poundm for local tourism, the farmersrsquo union says it is ldquofar from impressed at the assertion that the designation will bring increased recreational opportunities and promote social inclusion.UFU deputy president Victor Chestnutt said farmers in the Newry, Mourne and Down area were were ldquofar from impressed with promises made by officials they met recently.The UFU official continued: ldquoI would like to remind these officials that farmers have been the custodians of the land for hundreds of years. Imposing a designation on this area will affect their livelihoods which will have a knock-on effect on all ratepayers in the area.ldquoCouncil officials believe and are promoting that this designation will not restrict the operations of any farmer. This is unrealistic and their approach is disappointing.ldquoWe are % opposed to these plans and I would urge the council to meet our members, listen to their concerns and reconsider their plans to progress with such an application.Mr Chestnutt is encouraging local authority officials to provide figures to UFU members to support claims that geopark branding will help grow farm businesses, confirming that until farmers see the figures in black and white, they will continue to dispute any such claims.The UFU vice-president said with local government elections fastapproaching, the organisation believes the time is right to review any proposed geopark application.He continued: ldquoThe UFU has made contact with each of the parties and all independent councillors who currently hold seats on Newry, Mourne and Down Council and it is disappointing that only a very small number have taken the time to listen and engage with us. We have many members residing and working in the area and some councillors have missed a genuine opportunity to engage with their constituents.The senior union official said the ldquostigma around the Mournes national park debate a number of years ago is still very much at the forefront of farmersrsquo minds, explaining that at the time, UFU members were united in their opposition to the proposals.Mr Chestnutt said the UFU believed that farmers who live and work in the area should decide whether or not an area is suitable for national park or global geopark status.He said the council had put nothing on the table to reassure members and encourage them to reverse their position.With tourism one of the key drivers behind the geopark branding, Mr Chestnutt said Tourism NI was ldquovisibly absent from any discussions.He said farmers believed tourism in the area could be developed without the need to introduce a special designation.ldquoThe funding and resources the council has earmarked for the development and operation of the proposed new geopark should be redirected to the general promotion of tourism and infrastructure development. We are in favour of economic development but securing geopark status is not the way to do it, he declared.Mr Chestnutt added: ldquoOur message is simple and direct ndash farmers in the area are strongly opposed to the geopark proposal and I would urge all councillors, council officials and the Geological Survey of NI to fully and meaningfully engage with us.ldquoThe best course of action would be to rethink the geopark proposal and focus tourism investment into wider promotion of our beautul countryside.A spokesman for Newry, Mourne and Down Council said the geopark had the potential to make a ldquosignicant contribution to local communities and tourism in the Mourne, Ring of Gullion and Strangford and Lecale areas.ldquoIt is important to understand that a geopark is not a legislative designation and will therefore not place any restrictions on economic activity within the proposed areas, including on any farming practices, he said.ldquoThe introduction of a geopark will not introduce additional planning restrictions and instead will simply provide an globally recognised accreditation.ldquoThe geopark will only include sites which already have public access and the geopark will not promote any access to private land, unless the landowner in question wants to work with the geopark.The spokesman added: ldquoThe process to achieve geopark designation is ongoing and it is not until  that an accreditation would be confirmed as part of this ongoing process.ldquoIn the meantime, the council will continue to deliver events and activities to increase awareness of what the project represents and how it can grow our tourism offering and support our local communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C March 13%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash THE Earl of Clanwilliamrsquos th century mansion and -acre estate at Montalto, Ballynahinch, officially goes on sale today.

Almost immediately the perfect skull complete with teeth was removed to prevent damage and a process of dating the skeleton began.The farmer wishes to keep his identity and the location of the field unknown in an effort to prevent vandalism and damage to nearby fields which have been planted with early potatoes.This was the first time that the field had been ploughed in recent years and this, combined with the severe frosts and natural erosion, contributed to the moving of the skeleton closer to the surface.The site of the finding is referred to a history of Killyleagh written in  which states that human bones had been found in the area before and that there were others known to lie there.According to the history the tradition is that they are the bones of Protestants who during the rebellion of  were chased by the native Irish and were massacred.BALLYGOWAN mdash Five year-old Tara Rhodes, who has several relatives in Ballygowan, has flown to America with her father in a frantic bid for emergency treatment.Tara, who has a brain tumour which has already left her blind mdash is preparing to undergo treatment which will cost about pound,.The money has been collected through a special fund which was set up last November by Tararsquos mother, Sara, who was told by doctors that her daughter had only six months to live.Despite the claims of medical experts, Tararsquoa anguished parents launched a UK-wide appeal campaign, which included a special charity dance in Ballygowan.DRUMAGHLIS mdash Plans to shut down Drumaghlis Primary School, near Crossgar, have been ditched by the Department of Education.The small country school, which is  years old and caters for  children, has escaped the threat of closure and is expected to undergo a modernisation programme soon.Earlier this year the Department suggested that the school should be closed, but pressure from the schoolrsquos management committee has led to a reversal of plans.The Department thought that it may be better to close the school because it lacked many facilities and was not up to modern day standard.The Rev Dr W D Bailie, chairman of the management committee, protested bitterly and called on the support of the South Eastern Education and Library Board.Dr Bailie said: ldquoWe are delighted that the Department has responded to our plea to permit the school to continue to cater for the educational needs of this area.CROSSGAR mdash Preparations are well under way for the big Easter fair to be held in Crossgar War Memorial Hall on April .

Parking around the Bridge Street and Mount Crescent area is limited, she remarked.ldquoWe do not encourage students to drive to school. When they do, students are advised through sixth-form year assemblies that there are residential homes in the area and due consideration needs to be given to that. We advise them that they should park with care and consideration and within the law and they are reminded not to park on the pavement.ldquoPupils who drive a car to school provide us with their car details. Should a complaint be left by a member of the public, we attempt to identy the driver and address the issue.Mrs Perry added that this was currently a ldquospike time of the school year for student drivers as it combined both pupils from its upper sixth year who have been driving for upwards of a year and lower sixth pupils who had recently passed their driving tests..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Posnett powers Saul to cosy win  ","story":"TEAM Saul claimed victory in the CosyRoof Winter League at St Patrickrsquos Golf Club.Saul were led by captain Phil Posnett and Donard, who they beat in the final, were headed by deputy captain captain Gerry Reilly.After poor weather on Saturday it was Saul that were quickest out of the blocks come Sunday morning with Phil and Ed Baggley snr both shooting  points.These scores were quickly followed by their team-mates Joe Deegan withand Lawrence Craig with  points.The champagne was now chilling nicely, particularly as the first two Donard scores from Gerry Reilly with  points and Bill Dunlop with  points, made no inroads into Saulrsquos  total.In the early afternoon the drama began to unfold as Joe OrsquoNeill shot an incredible  points to bring Donard within touching distance of the prize.

Bryansfordrsquos Chris Brannigan was the lsquogo torsquo man for vital scores and Carryduffrsquos Ronan Lawlor won a Colleges All-Star award that year.Previous wins in the competition came in ,  and  with the teams of lsquo and lsquo going on to win the All Ireland Collegesrsquo B final.Cathair Dhoire may not have the same sort of identity or history as the Red High, but they will still be a tough nut to crack.The Red Highrsquos campaign didnrsquot start that well and they lost their opening group game - to - when Our and Lady and St Patrickrsquos, Knock, edged past them by the narrowest of margins.They picked up a bit of momentum following a comprehensive - to - victory over St Patrickrsquos, Keady.This was followed up by a - to - win over St Louisrsquo, Ballymena, before a - to - extra-time victory against St Malachyrsquos, Castlewellan, in the quarter-finals.St Louisrsquo, Ballymena, were their semi-final opponents, but they were no match for the Red High flair and went down - to -.Meanwhile, Cathair Dhoire enjoyed wins over Our Ladyrsquos, Castleblaney, Our Ladyrsquos and St Patrickrsquos, Knock, and Inis Eoghan, Donegal, on their way to the final. In addition, the St Columbrsquos players in the squad were also involved with their schoolrsquos senior team that won this seasonrsquos Markey Cup.The Derry side are blessed with a plethora of talented players, none more so than Ben McCarron, a highly-rated forward who played for his county in this yearrsquos McKenna Cup.St Patrickrsquos will look to their defensive markers, Eoin Rooney and Jack Harbinson, while skipper Ronan Murphy, Ciaran Watson and Peter McMullan will hope to turn defence into attack.Murphy is really looking forward to the final and believes that his team-mates have all the hard yards done in training.ldquoWe are really looking forward to the final. This is one of the reasons we all play the game. It makes all the hard work and effort worthwhile, he said.ldquoPreparations are going well. I canrsquot fault the lads, everyone is putting in a sht and getting out to training. Hopefully, all the hard work will pay off.ldquoWe donrsquot really know much about Cathair Dhiore as all year we have just concentrated on our game and what we need to do. They obviously have good players to get this far with a few lads who have won Ulster Colleges All Star awards and played senior football for Derry, so, we know they are pretty decent.He continued: Getting to the final has created a real buzz and itrsquos infectious. Everyone in the school is looking forward to it. The school is covered in maroon and gold and itrsquos just class as it sends good vibes all around the place.ldquoFormer players and coaches have been wishing us well and it has been great to see them involved as the Red High has a huge history and tradition in Ulster Collegesrsquo football.St Patrickrsquos have potential match winners all over the park and in Tim Prenter mdash a regular starter in the countyrsquos senior hurling team mdash Ruairi OrsquoHare, Brandon Boyd, Tom Smyth and Niall Laverty they have players capable of winning games on their own.Red High coach Declan Morgan believes that his charges have what it takes to go all the way this year.ldquoWe have been training exceptionally hard, but the boys enjoy the work and there is a great camaraderie in the squad, he said.ldquoThere is pace and mobility all over the pitch and we have defenders that can negate Cathair Dhoirersquos scoring threat. Our lads all know the job they have to do. We have invested a lot in this squad and they have responded brilliantly.ldquoHowever, there is no guarantee in football and know we have a lot to do to get our hands on the cup, he added.ldquoWe havenrsquot mentioned the fact that we are already through to the All-Ireland Collegesrsquo B semi-finals, regardless of Mondayrsquos outcome, as amalgamated schools are unable to compete in that competition.ldquoThe boys are focused totally on winning on Monday and they will not be taking their eye off the ball.The final is still a long way off for several players who face a weekend of action in other sports.ldquoWe canrsquot wrap up the boys in cotton wool, but I will be on the phone on Saturday night to several of the players to ensure they havenrsquot picked up any injuries, Mr Morgan said.ldquoHowever, we have a  strong  and they have all bought into the team ethos and our horses for courses policy.ldquoThe lads are so looking forward to the final and are fully aware of the schoolrsquos history in the competition.He added: Itrsquos been a while since the MacLarnon Cup was in Downpatrick, but I am convinced this squad can bridge that gap and bring the trophy back to the Red High for the first time in  years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"St Michael’s are champions  ","story":"ST Michaelrsquos wrapped up the - league title with two matches to spare when they overcame visiting St Patrickrsquos.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Believe it or not, itrsquos been far too long since wersquove had a debate on this issue in Parliament, and I spoke about the importance of our investments and pensions going into renewable sources, not into fossil fuels.I also pointed out my support for the young people across the UK who went on a climate strike the week before.

The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport.

The seniors school can be found on Hickman Road, the juniors and nursery a short distance on in Victoria Road.School facilities include a full gym, a library, an IT suite, a sports hall, science laboratories, and nearby access to local sports facilities including athletics track, Penarth RFCrsquos rugby pitch and the International Sports Village in Cardf Bay.Traditionally the school was strictly boys only. However, in the mid s the decision was taken to also accept girls and become a coeducational school.Westbourne was first established in Penarth in  as Westbourne House Preparatory School for Boys, and has kept the choice for children to board.A number of international students attend the school, and they often board with families from the area ndash usually Westbourne alumni themselves. More than  dferent nationalities take the opportunity to board in the area.Westbourne are rightly proud of this international aspect.ldquoEveryone here mixes in together, said Marie de Tito Mount, the schoolrsquos director of marketing. ldquoWe have children studying from Russia, China, the US, Poland, India, and theyrsquore all friends.ldquoTherersquos no cliques or groups, and wersquore proud of the international aspect this is giving our children.ldquoWe feel like wersquore making them citizens of the world.Ranked st in Wales by The Sunday Times Schools Guide and st in the UK by The DailyLeague Tables,  per cent of Westbourne graduates go to Russell Group universities or equivalently elite international institutions.The school points to two factors for this ndash the small number of pupils, and the highly trained staff.With a class size of just eight students per teacher on average, every student gets full and unided attention.The children clearly thrive from this, building confidence and passion for their work.In reception, there was a palpable excitement to show off their handmade vegetable dolls.A Year Five jumped at the chance to read out her ndash impressively well-written ndash poem.In the senior school, a young man attacked a maths problem on a board with gusto. He was animated and passionate, and had clearly forged a close bond with his teacher.The head of Westbourne Prep School, Joanne Chinnock, said: ldquoOur school is a happy place, and wersquove long held the philosophy happy children learn well.       ,params: .pushldquoOur lsquosecretrsquo is the very close bond between the children, from Nursery and Reception classes all the way to the top of the school and the staff, who know each child very well indeed.There are a huge number of after school clubs on offer. Children have the opportunity to learn a wide range of instruments, including the harp, trumpet, piano, violin, drums, guitar and organ.A large set of sports clubs stake full advantage of the the Welsh coast, with frequent use of Penarth Pier, the beach and natural beauty spot Cosmeston Lakes. Sports on offer include swimming, yoga, basketball, touch rugby, dodge ball, gymnastics, cross country, and football.There are even more opportunities to excel in other areas, with offerings including Young Journalists, Nature Club, Art Club, Chess and ldquoMad Science.Westbourne offers the InternationalDiploma Programme in sixth form and GCSEs and IGCSEs for its secondary pupils.Their IB average is - points, high enough to qualy for Oxford University, with two-thirds of all Higher Level grades being s and s, and two-thirds of students receiving a Bilingual Diploma.The GCSE results are equally impressive with  per cent of all grades being s and s per cent the new, harder, grade  and a further  per cent grade s. This is up to five times the UK average.The academic rigour extends to the staff too. More than  per cent of teachers at Westbourne have a PhD or masters and more than  per cent have taught internationally.Westbourne School has cultivated a warm and highly supportive culture one in which students and teachers truly support each other.For more information, visit:https:www.westbourneschool Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Then to handler Gerry Cosgrave to get the horse ready for his first point to point race.Thrills abounded when his black and red colours were chosen and on April , , Battleoverdoyen won his first race at Loughanmore with jockey Mark O’Hare.Michael recalls his phone never stopped on the way home and the next day the cream of racing were looking to buy the winner.He decided to go to the prestigious Tattersalls sales in Cheltenham the following week and the horse, was set at a reserve for £,.After a buzzing sales ring it sold to the powerhouse Gigginstown stud, owned by the O’Leary’s of Ryanair fame, for a whopping £,.Michael recalls it wasn’t about the money. He has been a punter all his le and dreamed of owning a superstar.For him it was about seeing a stud which could develop his horse into a future star.Describing Battleoverdoyen’s style, Michael believes it is all in his stride. He recalled the thoroughbred, who is  hands tall, at a point to point. “He was third last and they thought that was it. But that is his style of running.

Over the years Goal Line has worked with young people who have had a wide range of disabilities including Autism, Asperger’s Syndrome, ADHD , Down’s Syndrome, developmental delays, speech and other problems.In order to benefit from the PHA CLEAR Grant, Goal Line opted for a number of self-initiatives based around art and creative therapies, and several physical activity programmes that tested the young people in the sports hall in a iety of activities and team challenges.The young people benefitted from, and thoroughly enjoyed, a wide range of activities which saw personal development and well-being very much to the fore.Youth Support Worker Maxine Chambers said: “For the young people, being able to work in a group and develop their confidence and then to be able to voice their opinions and their own interpretation of things has been fantastic through Jason’s workshops. Through Trevor’s ceramic flower work it was a chance for them to deal with sensory issues, overcome issues with messy clay and that sort of thing.“Some of them were afraid to get their hands dirty or put them into the clay but when they saw people doing it they knew that it was ok. And when it came to painting the flowers it was brilliant, they loved all that – the outcome was superb and they were delighted to see what actually came at the end of the project with the flowers forever, flowers for their parents and the parents were amazed that the children had made those.“The fitness sessions were great in getting them into the sports hall and getting them involved in activities that they may not have tried before or at all – the New Age curling and boccia were good examples and it was good to see them having great fun indoors in something they can all do.”The grant also enabled Goal Line to facilitate a talk about strategies for dealing with dficult behaviours in young people. The talk was given by Dr Kate Kirk, a psychodrama psychotherapist from the Isle of Man. It was well attended by family, principals of primary schools, teachers, Special Educational Needs Co-ordinators, social workers, doctors and youth workers.

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range.

Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

The proposal for the work to Broadcasting House on Ormeau Avenue in Belfast was approved last March by the BBC board, with the announcement made to staff by the BBCs director general Lord Tony Hall. Now, the plans – which include the redevelopment of the exisiting BBC Broadcasting House building, including the refurbishment and extension of the buildings – will be put to the public, as part of a necessary pre-application event before planning can be submitted. It includes a new extension to the rear, including a landscaped plaza opening onto Linenhall Street. A spokesman for BBC Northern Ireland told Ulster Business: \"As part of the pre-planning application process, public consultation events will take place this month before we can move on to the next phase. The investment to BBC Broadcasting House in Belfast, announced in March last year, will transform the iconic building, its technology and facilities, highlighting the BBC’s commitment to audiences in Northern Ireland. We will share more detail in due course.\" Money invested will go towards structural work on the -year-old building to ensure its long-term sustainability, addressing what the state broadcaster has said are \"critical deficiencies\". Before the announcement last year that the BBC was to stay put and develop its existing building, it was understood the broadcaster had been eyeing up other city centre locations, or could create a new media hub in the Titanic Quarter. The event will take place at the Clayton Hotel on March , between pm and pm, and March  between pm and .pm.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20190201_0983.jpg","title":"pwc investing in people purpose and belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business Almost  years after it moved  staff and , paper files into Waterfront Plaza, PwC will move again – this time taking around , people and some very smart technology to Merchant Square in the heart of Belfast Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business locally.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC. Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pwc_1221.jpg","title":"pwc ni to crack  staff by ","story":"Posted on Thursday March  by Ulster Business PwC is set crack the , staff mark by the end of next year as it moves into its new £m offices in the heart of Belfast city centre, Ulster Business can reveal.Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business here.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC.

As Theresa May is due to bring her withdrawal deal back to Parliament next week, with less than a month to go before the March  deadline, a letter from the CBI, signed by  firms, calls on MPs to unite behind a way forward that avoids a hard border and protects peace and economic progress in Northern Ireland.  It says that “local businesses believe that the failure to approve a deal with Europe on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will have signicant repercussions for the local economy\". “Such a scenario will both hinder indigenous and foreign direct investment, it would result in signicant job losses and will stle opportunities for the next generation across Northern Ireland.  “We therefore urge MPs across the UK to consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  “The peace and economic progress that flowed from the Belfast  Good Friday Agreement cannot be overlooked at this critical time in the UK’s history. All Members of Parliament must consider the burden of responsibility that they now carry for this region’s future.” Those putting their names to the open letter include aerospace giant Bombardier, which employs around , staff here, Danske Bank and First Trust, along with agribusinesses such as Devenish Nutrition, Fane Valley and Linden Foods.
