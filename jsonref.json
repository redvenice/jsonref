The cherry and other fruit trees, the hawthorns and blackthorns, all feature in his works, famously created on his iPad.Now Hockney, 82, is the inspiration for a competition to encourage young and old to create an image that captures the season and to lift coronavirus lockdown spirits.The idea for Hope in Spring: draw like Hockney came from another Briton abroad, Ruth Mackenzie, artistic director of the Châtelet theatre in Paris, former director of Scottish Opera and the Nottingham Playhouse as well as the London 2012 Festival of the Olympic Games.After receiving a letter from Hockney, who was sending works to his friends, Mackenzie suggested a tie-in with the competition.“I asked David if he would consider doing something for French people in lockdown needing a touch of solidarity and he very generously sent us one of his works exclusively and shared another nine with us and agreed to do this brilliant competition to inspire and spark some joy,” Mackenzie said.“It just seemed a lovely idea to share his fantastic spirit of optimism and hope and colour. Hopefully it will inspire people all around the world.”The theatre is organising the competition with France Inter radio and the Centre Pompidou in Paris, which held a major Hockney retrospective in 2017.Another British artist, Grayson Perry, has been helping people through the lockdown with his Channel 4 show Grayson’s Art Club in which he creates works and talks to guests. He has also invited members of the public to send in their lockdown art.Hockney has been isolation with his dog Ruby and long-standing assistants, JP (Jean-Pierre Gonçalves de Lima) and Jonathan (Wilkinson). In his letter to Mackenzie, accompanied by a picture of some daffodils entitled Do remember they can’t cancel the Spring, Hockney wrote:“We came back to Normandy on 2 March and I began drawing these gaunt trees on my iPad. Since the virus hit, we are locked down.“I’m 82, I’m going to die. We die because we are born. The only things that matter in life are food and love, in that order, and also our little dog Ruby. I truly believe this, and for me, the basis of art is love. I love life.”The Châtelet, like all French theatres, has been closed since 17 March when the lockdown began and does not know when it will reopen. However, it has been organising cultural events on line and through its magazine Tchat!Mackenzie added: “The role of culture in this difficult time is to unite us around our shared emotions and give us hope for the world to come. That’s what David is doing by offering us this exceptional gift. His letter is so clear sighted about death and he says things we all need to understand.“He is very respected and loved in France and rightly so, but it isn’t always the case with English artists.”Hockney moved to Normandy last year saying he was attracted to the landscape that offered a broader range of blossoms, with apple, cherry, pear and plum trees as well as the hawthorn and blackthorn he has painted in the past.In an interview with the  last month, Hockney urged people to draw during the lockdown. “I would suggest they really look hard at something and think about what they are really seeing,” he said.The deadline for entries is 21 June and 10 winning drawings will be selected from the three partner organisations in the event: the Châtelet theatre, France Inter radio and the Centre Pompidou and put on display"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c78f047d2200614bb474ede473984a25e455ce35/67_125_3424_2055/master/3424.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecea1d10f0391c9da06ba96078328031","title":"legendary paris bookshop reveals reading habits ernest hemingway gertrude stein shakespeare and company","story":"Newly digitised lending cards from Shakespeare and Company uncover the choices of luminaries including Ernest Hemingway and Gertrude Stein A project to digitise records from the bookshop and lending library Shakespeare and Company offers a window into Paris during the jazz age, revealing the reading habits of literary titans including Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce and Gertrude Stein.The handwritten cards show that in 1925, decades before he wrote his novel The Old Man and the Sea, Hemingway was borrowing Joshua Slocum’s memoir, Sailing Alone Around the World. And the records, scrawled by the shop’s clerks, chart how Stein matched intellectual pursuits with lighter reading including TH Crosfield’s historical romance A Love in Ancient Days, and Andrew Soutar’s fantasy Equality Island.When Sylvia Beach opened Shakespeare and Company in 1919, English-language books were expensive and hard to find in Paris. Writers and artists who had flocked to the capital of literary modernism rushed to sign up for Beach’s library service. Along with Hemingway and Stein, writers from Aimé Césaire to Simone de Beauvoir, Jacques Lacan, Walter Benjamin and Joyce all became members – and would have been chased up for late returns with a drawing of an exasperated Shakespeare pulling out his hair.Beach published Joyce’s controversial novel Ulysses in 1922, and kept the shop open until 1941, when she was forced to close after refusing to sell her last copy of Joyce’s Finnegans Wake to a Nazi officer. George Whitman opened a new incarnation of the shop in 1951, and Beach’s papers were acquired by Princeton University in 1964. The university has been working since 2014 to digitise records from the vast archive, which runs to 180 boxes, making them available to researchers online for the first time as part of the Shakespeare and Company project.Joshua Kotin, an associate professor of English at Princeton and the project’s director, said that Beach was a “meticulous, obsessive record keeper”, and that “we are only now developing digital tools that will allow us to understand and realise the archive’s potential”.“There are so many treasures left to be discovered. If you stack all the papers in the archive, it would be a 78-foot tower,” he said. “I’m still finding treasures – for example, just before the pandemic hit, I found a manuscript for George Antheil’s Ballet Mécanique (1924), which Antheil gave to Beach.”The records reveal that Hemingway borrowed more than 90 books, from PT Barnum’s autobiography to Lady Chatterley’s Lover, which he checked out for eight days in September 1929 – the year DH Lawrence’s novel first appeared in France, 30 years before it was published in the US. In 1926, he borrowed a copy of Tom Jones’s Bull Fighting – the running of the bulls played a central part in his 1926 novel The Sun Also Rises. He also bought a copy of his own novel A Farewell to Arms at the store.“We want to understand genius,” Kotin said. “Does what Hemingway read help us understand what he wrote and why it is so great? It is also fascinating to connect our everyday practices – what we borrow from our local library, what’s in our Amazon cart – to the practices of people in the past. And there’s something illicit about learning about what and how people read – we’re learning about a very private, solitary activity.”Some of the records, he said, “tell a surprising or poignant story”. Shortly before he died, Walter Benjamin borrowed two books: a German-English dictionary, and Lord Bacon’s Physical and Metaphysical Works. When France fell to the Germans, Benjamin fled Paris, but he killed himself in September 1940, after Spanish police told him he would be handed over to the Gestapo.The archive makes unexpected connections, Kotin continued, with Aimé Césaire “borrowing and re-borrowing the poets of the Harlem Renaissance Jacques Lacan borrowing an obscure book about Irish history because he’s reading Joyce’s Ulysses Claude Cahun – under the name Mlle Lucie Schwob – reading Henry James Gertrude Stein reading fantasy novels. So many people read so-called high-brow and low-brow work at the same time.”The archive also sheds light on the lesser-known members of the library, Kotin added, who numbered in the thousands. “I love the member Alice Killen. She was the most active member of the library. She borrowed hundreds over books over 18 years,” he said. “The project allows us to learn about and remember these people.”The American Library Association requires libraries to destroy patron records to protect their privacy Shakespeare and Company was not affiliated with the ALA, and Beach kept everything. “She probably should have destroyed her records,” Kotin said, “but I’m happy that she didn’t.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8d1b8c6c8b0a0de4435e332798806d2256be2c2/0_263_4747_2847/master/4747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=332ae728efeaf6da622b972de9df90fe","title":"marks spencer holds huge sale clothing piles up amid lockdown","story":"Marks \u0026amp Spencer has launched a huge half-price clothing sale as the high street shutdown leaves retailers with mountains of unsold spring and summer fashion.The retailer has also confirmed its new clothing and homewares boss, Richard Price, will arrive in July. M\u0026ampS poached Price, the head of Tesco’s F\u0026ampF clothing and homeware label, last November but no start date had been confirmed. He has worked at M\u0026ampS before, for seven years, but left in 2012 after becoming disillusioned with the retailer’s strategy at the time.Price is returning to M\u0026ampS as the pandemic sends shockwaves through the retail industry. High street retailers have been scrabbling to cancel stock orders for next season as the impact of the crisis points to weak demand for the rest of the year.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.M\u0026ampS has been trying to reinvent itself for nearly two decades but under the current chief executive, Steve Rowe, and its chairman, Archie Norman, the retailer is redesigning its fashion and food ranges to broaden its appeal and attract more young families – essentially the same demographic as F\u0026ampF.Rowe said Price was joining M\u0026ampS at a crucial time: “I am confident that his leadership will accelerate the transformation of our clothing and home business and build on the improvements in product, value and availability over the past year.”Price, who also ran the now defunct department store chain BHS for three years, is a more orthodox choice than his predecessor Jill McDonald, a former boss of Halfords and McDonald’s who had no fashion experience before joining M\u0026ampS. She was sacked after bad buying decisions left the company with what Rowe said were the worst stock levels “I have ever seen in my life”.M\u0026ampS, which is due to report its annual results next week, has already scrapped its final idend and told shareholders not to expect payouts in 2021 either as it battens down the hatches. The retailer said its clothing and homeware business had been “severely constrained during lockdown”.Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said the rainbow sale looked to be “quite a clever way of covering up the fact that M\u0026ampS is having to sell a mountain of surplus clothing’”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce1423a1d6fffd6fcca6d08d8e4e88fa5ede2b48/0_203_4794_2878/master/4794.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ae1f9e67d67263ffa9e1c33b010490a","title":"epidemiologists contact tracing coronavirus","story":"If used with adequate testing, isolation and social distancing, tracing could be key to reducing the spread of Covid-19As quarantine measures are slowly lifted in the UK, the virus will continue to spread unless the government puts in place a strategy to curb the rate of infection. Contact tracing, a practice long used in public health to control infectious diseases, will be crucial to driving down the rate of infection, or R, and minimising further cases of coronavirus.Epidemiologists have been using traditional contact tracing for years to control sexually transmitted infections, infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and meningitis. The basic principle of how an infectious disease spreads is that one inidual, person A, will pass on the disease to person B, who then passes it on to C, continuing in a chain to D, E, F and onwards. Epidemiologists interrupt these chains of transmission by identifying people through contact tracing before they spread the infection to others.If we diagnose a sexually transmitted disease in person B, for example, a highly trained public health or clinical professional will interview that person, and ask them who they have had sex with recently. There has to be a person A, from whom B acquired the infection in the first place, and there may be one or more Cs, or people they passed it on to. Though it’s not always possible to identify all the As and Cs that could be involved, one major development in contact tracing has been mobile phones: person B may have the relevant phone numbers or dating app details that lead back to others.Once identified, these A and Cs are invited to attend a sexual health clinic for investigation and are treated if they test positive. If the contact tracing is successful and the chain of transmission is broken, there will be no Ds or Es. Tuberculosis follows the same principle. Contract tracers initially identify those in the infected person’s household, where the risk of being infected with TB is highest. Because the disease is usually spread by a person who has TB in their lungs, public health professionals may also ask the patient to identify colleagues or friends who have had an obvious cough for a number of weeks.The third disease we use contact tracing for is invasive meningococcal disease. Close contacts – typically those within the same household, or people who have shared overnight accommodation – are at a markedly increased risk of developing these rare conditions. These people will usually be offered antibiotics to eliminate bacteria and stop the infection developing.Contact tracing for coronavirus is different to these diseases and presents new challenges. For one thing, the sheer number of cases – the Office for National Statistics estimates that 148,000 people in England have been infected with the virus over the past two weeks – means contact tracers will have their work cut out. But it’s also much more difficult to identify a person A with Covid-19. They may have shown no symptoms, or may have already recovered before person B develops symptoms. So it’s crucial to identify as many of the Cs as possible, before they go on to pass the infection to others. When contact tracers have identified potential Cs, these people are asked to isolate until they get tested, and stay at home until they test negative.Isolating one single case can prevent a whole chain of future transmissions. This is why tracing, isolating and testing people for coronavirus is essential for reducing the R rate across a population. Although it’s impossible to find all cases, the more cases that are contact-traced, the more the R is driven down.The number of asymptomatic coronavirus cases means that a contact-tracing app is an important part of breaking the transmission chain. In countries such as South Korea, these apps, used together with traditional tracing methods, have been crucial for controlling the virus. The people you pass at the supermarket or on the street may be unknown carriers of the disease. If they later develop and report symptoms, the app sends an alert to people who came into contact with them.One important feature of apps such as the one used in South Korea is geolocation data. This additional feature allows public health authorities to identify potential hotspots of transmission earlier than they would otherwise, targeting measures quickly and efficiently at the places where these are most needed. Of course, some have raised privacy concerns about apps that use geolocation data (the NHSX app uses Bluetooth to inform other app users, and doesn’t currently capture geolocation data). Many would consider South Korea’s contact-tracing approach, which uses CCTV and credit card data alongside geolocation information, an invasion of privacy. But as we saw in the recent nightclub outbreak, where South Korean authorities were able to contact everyone present in the building, this level of detail allows public health authorities to quickly identify potential cases.The UK government has announced that it will deploy 18,000 contact tracers, 3,000 of whom will be health professionals. Ideally, each newly identified person with coronavirus would be contacted by one of these team members, who would then identify others that person had come into contact with, and advise them accordingly. The more cases that are found, the better – but even if contact tracers only manage to identify a portion of coronavirus cases, this will still have an impact on the spread of the virus.Crucially, contact tracing is part of a picture that should also include adequate testing, isolating and social distancing measures. Only with an integrated epidemic control strategy will we manage to reduce the spread of Covid-19.• Keith Neal is professor emeritus of epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f428b4da462d971decce1a36fc57102883605e8/0_61_3426_2056/master/3426.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=546bbf99d0fe23760903efc0698d3a29","title":"humans resources coronavirus democratise work health lives market","story":"Our health and lives cannot be ruled by market forces alone. Now thousands of scholars are calling for a way out of the crisisWorking humans are so much more than “resources”. This is one of the central lessons of the current crisis. Caring for the sick delivering food, medication and other essentials clearing away our waste stocking the shelves and running the registers in our grocery stores – the people who have kept life going through the Covid-19 pandemic are living proof that work cannot be reduced to a mere commodity. Human health and the care of the most vulnerable cannot be governed by market forces alone. If we leave these things solely to the market, we run the risk of exacerbating inequalities to the point of forfeiting the very lives of the least advantaged.How to avoid this unacceptable situation? By involving employees in decisions relating to their lives and futures in the workplace – by democratising firms. By decommodifying work – by collectively guaranteeing useful employment to all. As we face the monstrous risk of pandemic and environmental collapse, making these strategic changes would allow us to ensure the dignity of all citizens while marshalling the collective strength and effort we need to preserve our life together on this planet.Every morning, men and women, especially members of racialised communities, migrants and informal economy workers, rise to serve those among us who are able to remain under quarantine. They keep watch through the night. The dignity of their jobs needs no other explanation than that eloquently simple term “essential worker”. That term also reveals a key fact that capitalism has always sought to render invisible with another term, “human resource”. Human beings are not one resource among many. Without labor investors, there would be no production, no services, no businesses at all.Every morning, quarantined men and women rise in their homes to fulfil from afar the missions of the organisations for which they work. They work into the night. To those who believe that employees cannot be trusted to do their jobs without supervision, that workers require surveillance and external discipline, these men and women are proving the contrary. They are demonstrating, day and night, that workers are not one type of stakeholder among many: they hold the keys to their employers’ success. They are the core constituency of the firm, but are, nonetheless, mostly excluded from participating in the government of their workplaces – a right monopolised by capital investors.To the question of how firms and how society as a whole might recognise the contributions of their employees in times of crisis, democracy is the answer. Certainly, we must close the yawning chasm of income inequality and raise the income floor – but that alone is not enough. After the two world wars, women’s undeniable contribution to society helped win them the right to vote. By the same token, it is time to enfranchise workers.Representation of labour investors in the workplace has existed in Europe since the close of the second world war, through institutions known as works councils. Yet these representative bodies have a weak voice at best in the government of firms, and are subordinate to the choices of the executive management teams appointed by shareholders. They have been unable to stop or even slow the relentless momentum of self-serving capital accumulation, ever more powerful in its destruction of our environment. These bodies should now be granted similar rights to those exercised by boards. To do so, firm governments (that is, top management) could be required to obtain double majority approval, from chambers representing workers as well as shareholders. In Germany, the Netherlands and Scandinavia, different forms of codetermination (Mitbestimmung) put in place progressively after the second world war were a crucial step toward giving a voice to workers – but they are still insufficient to create actual citizenship in firms. Even in the United States, where worker organising and union rights have been considerably suppressed, there is now a growing call to give labour investors the right to elect representatives with a supermajority within boards. Issues such as the choice of a CEO, setting major strategies and profit distribution are too important to be left to shareholders alone. A personal investment of labour that is, of one’s mind and body, one’s health – one’s very life – ought to come with the collective right to validate or veto these decisions.This crisis also shows that work must not be treated as a commodity, that market mechanisms alone cannot be left in charge of the choices that affect our communities most deeply. For years now, jobs and supplies in the health sector have been subject to the guiding principle of profitability today, the pandemic is revealing the extent to which this principle has led us astray. Certain strategic and collective needs must simply be made immune to such considerations. The rising body count across the globe is a terrible reminder that some things must never be treated as commodities. Those who continue arguing to the contrary are imperilling us with their dangerous ideology. Profitability is an intolerable yardstick when it comes to our health and our life on this planet.Decommodifying work means preserving certain sectors from the laws of the so-called free market it also means ensuring that all people have access to work and the dignity it brings. One way to do this is with the creation of a job guarantee. Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reminds us that everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment. A job guarantee would not only offer each person access to work that allows them to live with dignity, it would also provide a crucial boost to our collective capability to meet the many pressing social and environmental challenges we currently face. Guaranteed employment would allow governments, working through local communities, to provide dignified work while contributing to the immense effort of fighting environmental collapse. Across the globe, as unemployment skyrockets, job guarantee programs can play a crucial role in assuring the social, economic, and environmental stability of our democratic societies. The European Union must include such a project in its green deal. A review of the mission of the European Central Bank so that it could finance this program, which is necessary to our survival, would give it a legitimate place in the life of each and every citizen of the EU. A countercyclical solution to the explosive unemployment on the way, this program will prove a key contribution to the EU’s prosperity. We should not react now with the same innocence as in 2008, when we responded to the economic crisis with an unconditional bailout that swelled public debt while demanding nothing in return. If our governments step in to save businesses in the current crisis, then businesses must step in as well, and meet the general basic conditions of democracy. In the name of the democratic societies they serve, and which constitute them, in the name of their responsibility to ensure our survival on this planet, our governments must make their aid to firms conditional on certain changes to their behaviours. In addition to hewing to strict environmental standards, firms must be required to fulfil certain conditions of democratic internal government. A successful transition from environmental destruction to environmental recovery and regeneration will be best led by democratically governed firms, in which the voices of those who invest their labor carry the same weight as those who invest their capital when it comes to strategic decisions. Let us fool ourselves no longer: left to their own devices, most capital investors will not care for the dignity of labour investors, nor will they lead the fight against environmental catastrophe.

The phrase Geisterspielen – ghost games – is about to become part of international, rather than just German, football nomenclature because on Saturday the Bundesliga will become the first of Europe’s elite leagues to resume in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.It may not be the most endearing way of framing it but there is no escaping that its European counterparts are viewing the Bundesliga as their guinea pig, learning from their best practice and, perhaps, any mistakes. After a few years of spreading its wings, creating an international arm to the business and beginning to chase down the Premier League’s domination of global popularity, the Bundesliga now has at least a few weeks of a clear run at a hungry worldwide football audience. It will be under the microscope from every imaginable angle.Before the restart there appears to be little complacency on the part of the Deutsche Fussball Liga (DFL), and the cliche about taking it one game at a time has never been more apt. This weekend is about “earning the right” to do it all again next week, as the DFL’s chief executive, Christian Seifert – the most visible figure in delivering and communicating the details of the resumption plan – says.They couldn’t feel much more prepared than they are in the circumstances, with the DFL’s Hygienekonzept running to 50 (publicly available) pages on everything from training and match-day protocol to television production and away-game procedures. Yet as the Germany national team physician, Dr Tim Meyer, who has been heading up the safety and hygiene task force, has said, mapping out a meticulous plan and living it are two distinct things.We have already had the Salomon Kalou incident at Hertha Berlin, and players and staff are having to unlearn the instinctive. The Werder Bremen coach Florian Kohfeldt spoke this week about how he is having to change his “tactile” coaching style, resisting the impulse to “put an encouraging arm around a player”. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200512-56802-gnl.fsof.200513.jf.Fascism.mp3 This is to be negotiated amid the simple joy, for many of these players, of being together again, training (and living in quarantine) as a group with something concrete for which to aim. The Bundesliga’s teams have made the most of the opportunity to rebond, albeit in different ways. Borussia Mönchengladbach have moved into their own hotel in the grounds of Borussia-Park, eating inside the stadium every morning, while Union Berlin went to a training camp 300km from home, near Hannover.The pressure – implied or otherwise – on the players has been something the clubs have been keen to address. Nobody is obliged to play is the message, with Gladbach’s sporting director, Max Eberl, emphasising: “The voluntary nature of this has always been our top priority,” and other clubs taking a clear stance that any player who didn’t feel comfortable with playing would not be punished. Some elements of the German media are sceptical, believing that to break ranks would go against the dressing-room code, and that significant peer pressure exists.The DFL has never hidden from the fact that not finishing the season would have severe implications for many of its 36 professional clubs in the top two tiers, with more than €300m (£260m) in television rights revenue still due from broadcasters. With confirmation on Thursday that the bottom two would be relegated and the top two from 2 Bundesliga promoted were the season to be abandoned, there is motivation aplenty.It may seem anachronistic to mention in the current climate but already this could be a potentially decisive weekend in the title race. Bayern Munich, the leaders, begin again on Sunday, with a trip to Union – which would be a lot more challenging in front of a full Försterei – but before that is the Revierderby between Borussia Dortmund and Schalke. If Dortmund were to fail to beat their rivals and Bayern won, they could be up to seven points adrift of the team they pushed mightily close last season but have won seven successive titles. Dortmund’s margin for error is small as they go into Saturday’s game not only without the influence of 80,000 supporters (though Sky Deutschland has an option for viewers at home to have club-specific chants layered over the top of each match broadcast) but also without the central midfield pair Axel Witsel and Emre Can.The table as it stands offers at least the prospect of a contest, with only six points separating a top four completed by RB Leipzig and the early-season pacesetters, Borussia Mönchengladbach. The tempo and youth of Julian Nagelsmann’s prolific and developing Leipzig side, alongside Marco Rose’s moulding of the latter into one of the ision’s must-watch teams, promise to be two of the resumption’s big draws.Theory and practice are two different matters, however. Not only will we learn quickly how the teams deal with the conditions but how the viewers will as well. The Bundesliga will take centre stage with a degree of vulnerability, knowing it is not only offering itself to be forensically examined worldwide but that it does so without perhaps its major asset – the fervent support in the stands that projects itself into front rooms everywhere. It’s not quite football as it’s meant to be, as its marketing strapline goes, but it will aim to do its very best impression."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/500e9fb692b831bbb5f9de85e5655d3d0e8d6307/1490_956_5552_3331/master/5552.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f2018b602b77c60c9237ef881438d4c","title":"beans three ways a trio of recipes for your store cupboard staple","story":"As a nation it’s safe to say we are baked bean lovers, and for years families have been passing on their unique bean recipes. Anna Masing serves up three fresh dinner ideas and gets the family stories behind the recipesYou can’t beat mopping up that delicious sauce with a piece of bread after a fry-up. But beans have moved on from the cooked breakfast. People proudly boast about their personalised recipes and each generation adds a new twist to a family favourite. Whether it’s breakfast, lunch or dinner, there’s always room for beans on our plate.With increasing health concerns about the reduction of sugar in our diet, Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz lets this comfort food become a convenient staple for health-conscious people. Here are three recipes built from love and tradition for you to try.Recipe developer and food editor Nadine Brown makes this dish for her family – her partner, her eight-year-old daughter and two-year-old niece: “It’s perfect for a hungry family with little patience,” she says.The dish is based on a recipe Brown developed a few years ago, but with tweaks made specifically for her family. Beans have always been a favourite in their house: “They taste great on their own or in a dish like this,” Brown explains. “The basil goes deliciously with the tomatoes and beans,” she says, talking about working with flavours, and adding more vegetables helps to get the kids their five a day. The no added sugar version is also something that Brown is pleased about: “It helps me keep an eye on the amount of sugar we consume in the house.”This dish is also about ease – it’s a “bung it all in one” dinner. Cooked in one dish, it can be simply brought to the table, and makes cleaning up a breeze. This is a dish that features on the weekends in Brown’s household, when they don’t have to think about work or school and can enjoy spending time together eating a meal in a relaxed way.Ingredients8 pork sausages4 garlic cloves, skin on, lightly bashed1 tbsp olive oil2 red onions, cut into wedges1 red pepper, seeds removed and cut into chunks1 green pepper, seeds removed and cut into chunks2 x 415g tins of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz30g basil leaves, roughly torn300g cherry tomatoes on the vineFreshly cracked black pepperCrusty bread to serveMethodPreheat your oven to 200Cfan 180Cgas mark 6.Add the sausages and garlic to a large, deep oven tray and drizzle with the oil.

Roz explains: “My mother made us minestrone regularly and this is an evolution of her recipe parmesan rind was suggested by an Italian friend. And baked beans was my addition.” For Zoe’s recipe, it has been about making tiny tweaks. “Mum has the recipe nailed so it’s hard to beat, but I add fried bacon, as the flavour melts into the whole dish, giving it a little extra depth and texture. Also, I add a pinch of smoked paprika to suit my Portuguese husband’s palate.”This dish is woven with personal memories. Roz tells how she grew up in the Middle East and had mainly American friends, so Heinz was a familiar brand and is reminiscent of that time. For Zoe, baked beans, and this recipe, are memories of childhood and comfort: “A rainy Sunday afternoon? Soup time. Off school sick? Definitely time to bring out the big guns of Mum’s minestrone. The smell of it cooking is beyond delicious, filling the house.“When discussing this recipe with Mum,” Zoe says, “she revealed its greatest quality – using what you have.” Utilising leftovers was a key part of the family home when growing up, and an ethos Zoe has continued. This recipe is easy to adapt and uses many basic store cupboard standards – especially the beans. And, after the extravagance of Christmas, this recipe offers a nourishing and healthier alternative thanks to the no added sugar beans.A store cupboard classic this is a British take on the famed Italian recipe. Without the optional bacon, it works as a main dish for vegetarians, and without the wine and chilli, it’s a great supper for kids.Preparation: 10 minutesCooking time: 20 minutesTotal time: 30 minutesServes: 4 as a light meal or 6 as a starterIngredients1 large red onion, chopped3 garlic cloves, crushed2 medium carrots, dicedHalf a red pepper, diced1 400g tin chopped tomatoes1 415g tin of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz1 handful of orzo or similar small pastaSaltfreshly ground pepperParmesan cheese (including rind)1 tsp Heinz tomato ketchup1 tbsp light olive oilA pinch of dried mixed herbs1 bay leaf1 small red chilli or a small pinch of chilli flakes (optional)125ml wine (red or white) or 2 dsp dry vermouth (optional)4 rashers of streaky bacon (optional)MethodSweat the onion, carrot and pepper gently in the oil for about 5 minutes.

This is a dish that has developed from family tradition and his rich cultural heritage. Rehncy speaks about how his love of cooking started young: “My parents are Indian but born in east Africa. Growing up in Tanzania I would spend time at my dad’s Indian restaurant with the chefs in the kitchen.”This has stood him in good stead – on a lads’ getaway he cooked this dish for 20 friends as the only one able to cook, he was responsible for making sure they were fed for the trip.Rehncy’s mother died when he was young and all hands were on deck in the house a memory he has is his father’s Saturday tradition of a fry-up, with baked beans being a staple. One Saturday his father added a twist – onions, spices and chillies – the beginnings of this recipe. Thadka loosely means to add spice. “When you create any Indian dish you need a base to start. Our base is the beans, and any spices added are the thadka,” says Rehncy. “I chose these spices because they’re simple, easy and most importantly, are in every Indian household – classics.”He says the masala beans go well with toast, eggs, or, as his wife loves them, straight out of the bowl!Rehncy adds that the no added sugar variant is great because most of the adults in his family are diabetic and this allows them to eat baked beans more often than not.Ingredients (per 2x 415g tins of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz)2 tbsp rapeseed oil1 white onion (finely diced)4 cloves garlic (finely chopped)4cm piece of ginger (grated or finely chopped)2 green chilli (finely chopped)1 tsp turmeric1 tsp cumin powder1 tsp mustard seeds1 tsp coriander powder1 tsp garam masala powderSmall bunch of fresh corianderMethodAdd the oil to a saucepan on a medium heat (enough for the tin of Heinz beans) with the oil and the mustard seeds. Once the mustard seeds begin to pop (you’ll hear little popping sounds), add the onion.Once the onion has started to soften, add in the ginger, garlic and chilli, cook down until the onion starts to brown slightly.Add in the cumin seeds and gently cook for another 2 minutes.Add the spices – turmeric, cumin powder, coriander powder and garam masala. Cook these down on a medium to low heat for a couple of minutes just to take the harshness out. Once you see the oil separating from the “masala mix” you can now add the Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz.Fold in the beans with the mixture until it is thoroughly mixed through and coated.

Does the jam or cream go on a scone first (and how do you pronounce scone)? Does pineapple belong on a pizza? And should your Heinz ketchup be kept in the fridge? (For the record: jam then cream rhyme it with “gone” certainly not and yes, definitely. Glad we cleared that up.)But few foods have triggered so many lengthy debates as the satisfyingly saucy baked bean. A British icon, the fierce loyalty these delicious legumes stir up is unparalleled. Which is the best bread to put them on? Is it OK to eat them cold? And should they really be touching other food on the plate? We’re here to solve these saucy conundrums once and for all. (Please note: the editor’s decision is final.)1 Beans should be enjoyed cold as wellWhile it’s traditional to heat up your Heinz Beanz, there are purists who swear by eating them cold, usually straight out of the tin. While we suspect their argument is partially based on sheer laziness, this is an easy one: either way of eating them is fine, but the best path to take is both. The true baked bean connoisseur snaffles a few tasty forkfuls after opening the tin, before heating the rest up.3 Acceptable toppingsThe beauty of baked beans is their versatility, which in turn can lead to tough decisions about which toppings, if any, are the best. We’ve heard cases for cooked chorizo, crispy bacon, hot sauce, chopped parsley, dried herbs and (of course) enough cheese to fell a horse. The short answer is that all these toppings, including none at all, are acceptable (except for non-cheddar cheeses, more of which later). Although, if you stir ketchup, brown sauce or, God forbid, mayonnaise into your beans, somebody needs to stage an intervention.4 The cheese rulesDespite their workmanlike appearance, cheesy beans are a thing of great beauty and delicate balance, and must be properly executed. The rules are as follows: cheddar is the only acceptable cheese. None of your gruyere or feta nonsense here, please. At a push, you might crumble in some Wensleydale, but cheddar offers the correct tanginess to offset the beans’ sweetness, and can be finely grated so the cheese drifts on to the beans like a soft, tasty blanket. Thickly grated cheddar is also delicious, but tends to stubbornly sit there, refusing to melt. Finally, while cheese stirred into beans is undoubtedly delicious, it’s simply not the correct way – the light dusting of cheese must melt into the beans on its own.5 No napkins, embrace the sauceDo you want to be that person with the napkin tucked under their chin in the work canteen? Do you? No, you do not. Beans, by their nature, love to throw themselves off your fork and bounce their saucy way down your clean shirt, like a stone skimmed by a champ. Wear your day-glo stains as a badge of honour. Your lunch was better than anyone else’s.6 Set the beans freeOf all the baked bean debates, the one about whether it’s OK for them to touch other foodstuffs in a full English breakfast is the most controversial. While there’s no question beans are an integral part of the meal, some people prefer theirs on the side, to avoid the sauce infiltrating any of the more absorbent items (eg bread, hash browns). Let’s be clear, though: serving your baked beans in a rubbish little ramekin is entirely unacceptable. If you really must separate them, the correct protocol is to create an edible holding pen fashioned out of sausages and bacon.7 The right type of breadThere are more ways to eat baked beans than there are beans in a tin (on average, 465 in total)! But although baked potatoes, crumpets, waffles or a bowl straight from the microwave are all acceptable vehicles for getting baked beans inside you, the classic accompaniment is toasted, buttered bread. When you pour your beans on to the toast, a corner must be left bean-free, to be saved for juice-mopping duties. And the correct bread choice is white or wholemeal and pre-sliced: no arguing. If you want to go really fancy, we’ll allow an uncut bloomer. But this isn’t the time for posh breads: none of your rye, pumpernickel or sourdough should be getting involved.

My mum used to bake bread. I can still remember waking up to the smell of her amazing little crusty rolls. We’d have them with crispy bacon, eggs and baked beans and that was just a little plate of joy to start the day. I can still taste it when I think about it.Mum’s from Antigua and beans are also a big part of Caribbean cooking. Rice and peas, which is really rice and beans, is one of my favourite things. It’s so comforting, it’s like the Caribbean version of mashed potatoes. Then you put curried goat or chicken or fried fish on it – or just more beans. If you’re tired or lonely, sad or happy – whatever it is – rice and peas will generally sort it out.These days I’ve become more aware of sugar in dishes. A honey glaze here, something else there and, before you know it, you’ve pushed the sugar levels way up. For me it’s all about balance now. And low-sugar products are great for that.You can also bring out sweetness using existing foods on your plate, for example when you’re cooking your onions or leeks, let them go for longer because they create their own sweetness as they caramelise. It takes a while to adjust to that different kind of sweetness but it really works. Or add some cumin and a little salt to carrots and roast them to enhance their sweetness.It’s no surprise to me that beans are such a mainstay of so many cultures. Brazil has feijoada – black beans and pork stew. Families come together and add farofa, a toasted cornmeal, to it. And think of pasta e fagioli in Italy. There’s a familiar heartiness that beans evoke for me and historically they’re a food that people without much money could afford.We see them as humble but forget how versatile they are. They’re a brilliant carrier of flavour and add real depth and ballast to a plate. They’re a kind of security food. When I became a mother, I’d send my kids to school on beans on toast because I knew it was going to last and fill them the right way. My daughter Miquita was also a big fan of my cheesy baked beans. It was a kind of Welsh rarebit with a bit of Worcester sauce, all bubbling under the grill with silky beans and crusty bread underneath.The most exciting thing in cooking is when you take something people think of as humble and transform it into something really delicious and surprising. People forget the ways they can use the tin of beans in the cupboard – they’re haricots in tomato sauce, which is the basis of so many dishes. That’s why I came up with this recipe, which combines pork and beans – an age-old combination. Watch any cowboy film and that’s what they’re eating.In this dish, I use tins of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz to pair with the pork the creaminess of the beans and the salty, spiciness of the pork just makes me really happy. Then you get amazing sweetness from the leek and garlic running through it all.A hearty recipe that’s bound to satisfy – if you’re making it for kids you can go easy on the chilli.

Take the pork belly, slip it into an ovenproof dish, rub in all the spices, then pour in the stock. Cover with tinfoil, and place in the oven for at least 90 minutes, and up to 120 minutes – the meat needs to be very tender so that when you test with a skewer or small knife it is soft. Remove from the oven and carefully transfer to a board or rack to cool it down. Reserve the cooking juices left in the pan as well. Take the meat and pull it apart or roughly chop it up. As with the juices, leave to one side.Take a good heavy-bottomed pan, melt the butter, add the oil, then all of the other ingredients except the beans. Soften the ingredients very gently over a low heat for about 40 minutes, until they are very soft and caramelised. Add the Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz, pour in the cooking juices from the pork belly.

Crisp and crunchy fish and chips, juicy burgers on the barbecue and decadent chocolate brownies are simply too much of a temptation, no matter that you’ve promised to be good this week. But you don’t have to choose between health and hankering after a little indulgence: we’ve rewritten the cookbook to give five comfort foods a healthier summer makeover.Using simple swaps we’ve reduced the salt, sugar and fat content of some of our favourite family meals, as well as increasing the vitamin and mineral content with a few extra portions of veg. What’s more – there’s no compromise on flavour.Here’s how to have your cake and eat it (and your chips, and your fry-up …).Healthier burger and chips Adding grated carrot or courgette to your favourite burger recipe is a savvy way to cut the fat content and increase your daily veg intake – and it keeps burgers moist on the barbecue too.Grate the vegetables finely, squeeze out as much liquid as you can, and stir in to lean mince, adding a dash of Worcestershire sauce and an egg to hold it all together. Cook the burgers on the barbecue, a griddle or in a frying pan, depending on the weather, and pile them up with plenty of tomatoes, crunchy lettuce and pickles.For healthier chips, cut large potatoes into thick fingers, boil them for four minutes and then roast in a hot oven with a drizzle of olive oil for 30 minutes or until golden. Less grease, less guilt – and lots of grinning faces around the table.Start by roasting sausages with sliced red onion, small cubes of sweet potato and a drizzle of oil in a hot oven. After about 20 minutes, or when the potatoes soften and the sausages are almost cooked through, add baby tomatoes on the vine, a handful of sliced flat-cap mushrooms and a few thyme sprigs, and bake for another 10 minutes. Make eight small gaps in the tray crack eggs into four of the holes and spoon Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz into the others, then bake for four minutes until the egg whites are set and the beans are warmed through. Serve with toast and a pot of tea.Feelgood fish and chipsReplace your normal fish-batter recipe with this healthier egg-based version – it’s salt free and cooks well in the oven. Not only are you increasing the protein content of this family favourite but by avoiding the deep-fat fryer you’ll cut down the fat content considerably.Whisk one egg white until stiff peaks form, then fold it into the broken yolk, adding lemon zest and finely chopped parsley. Dip two cod fillets into the egg-white batter and bake at 200Cfan 180Cgas mark 6 for 15 minutes until the batter is crisp and the fish is cooked through. Serve with healthier oven-cooked chips, see recipe above, and minty crushed peas or with a big green salad.Guilt-free chocolate browniesIt’s a universal fact that the ultimate chocolate brownie should be dense and fudgy on the inside, with a slightly crisp top for complete satisfaction. The big secret is that this can be achieved without a lot of butter and sugar!Tinned black beans or sweet potato work wonderfully in chocolate brownies, as they have a natural sweetness and a fudgy texture that stands up to the dark chocolate. For black bean brownies, replace the butter with a tin of beans and a little oil. And replace the sugar with maple syrup. For the sweet potato option, use two large sweet potatoes cooked and mashed and 14 dates to replace the butter and sugar respectively.A more unusual substitution is mayonnaise. Swap out butter for your favourite low cal mayo and you’ll get the same rich, gooey brownie but with less fat and fewer calories.Alternative beans on toastYes, beans on toast covered in melted cheese can solve most of your problems, but there are healthier ways to get the same hit. This baked-bean quesadilla is a fun, Mexican twist on a teatime treat and has all the beany-cheesy goodness but less sugar, salt and fat. Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz count as one of your five a day, and they’re naturally low in fat, with no added sugars, artificial colours, flavours or preservatives, which makes them a healthier alternative for all the family.Heat up a portion of the beans and then microwave two wholewheat flour tortillas for 15 seconds, or until warm.

Sprinkle with low-fat feta cheese, fresh coriander and a squeeze of lime, then put the other tortilla on top.

The final contender is thought to be another woman.The corporation’s board is understood to have informed the candidates and is planning to hold interviews in early June. The successful applicant will take over from Tony Hall when he stands down later this year.The BBC is known to have approached Alex Mahon, the chief executive of Channel 4, and held a conversation about the role in recent weeks, but she is understood to have declined to put her name in the hat.Davie continues to be seen as the frontrunner for the role, among the biggest jobs in British broadcasting. A former Procter \u0026amp Gamble and Pepsi marketer, Davie previously ran the BBC’s audio and music operation and acted as director general during the Savile crisis, before Lord Hall was appointed. He is currently the chief executive of BBC Studios, one of the broadcaster’s commercial arms. His colleague Moore, who works on the licence fee-funded side of the corporation, is the BBC’s director of content with a £1bn budget responsible for hit shows including Bake Off, Bodyguard and Luther. BBC insiders keen to see the role kept in-house say an elegant solution to potentially keep Davie and Moore could be to split Hall’s dual roles as director general and editor-in-chief.The wild card is Lewis, who finished a six-year stint at Dow Jones on Friday and who one source described as the “maverick option”. The 51-year-old has an extensive background in journalism, having worked at the Financial Times, Sunday Times and Daily , where he became the youngest editor-in-chief and oversaw the newspaper’s investigation into MPs’ expenses.It is understood that the whittled-down list of candidates until very recently included a senior executive at Amazon UK, as the corporation sought to canvas the widest range of potential contenders to lead BBC through its crucial next phase.The recruitment process is being led by David Clementi, the chair of the BBC board, who comes to the end of his four-year tenure early next year. The BBC declined to comment on the recruitment process.Whoever lands the role of director general will face challenges from all sides. The BBC is facing a mid-term review of its charter in 2022, which will focus on the cost and long-term future of the licence fee. Boris Johnson, who has had a combative relationship with the BBC since last year’s general election campaign, has talked about decriminalising non-payment of the annual £157.50 licence fee. The corporation has said such a move will cost it hundreds of millions of pounds.While the corporation is widely viewed as having proved its worth as part of British life during the coronavirus crisis, it remains highly probable that by the time of charter renewal in 2027, the broadcaster will be funded by an alternative mechanism.The BBC is also facing another round of cuts after revealing that its income will fall by £125m this year due to the coronavirus crisis. TV licence fee income will be down as door-to-door enforcement activity stops during the pandemic. The BBC has also been hit by the decision to delay the introduction of the licence fee for most over-75s, which had been due to come into effect this year but was deferred when older people were asked to self-isolate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3063777210d8c4a14de57fb69a03dfec6fc2026/3_0_5899_3543/master/5899.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=066ef2ea7659238c2e0a229e01771ce0","title":"blind date takeover looking for love in lockdown podcast part 2","story":"In the concluding part of our Blind Date takeover, two more couples meet remotely for a socially distanced evening of drinks and dinnerIn part 1 of our Blind Date takeover last week, three couples met up via Zoom and let us listen in to what a first date sounds like in the age of lockdowns.

Some initially concealed their triggering imagery, making it more difficult to protect people vulnerable to their effects. Clare Pelham, the chief executive of the Epilepsy Society, said such incidents had become more frequent, but that it was the first time they had been coordinated, in this case by a group of about six users. “During the current Covid-19 pandemic, we are all having to live our lives online to protect ourselves from an invisible enemy,” she said. “It is unthinkable that people who hide behind fictitious Twitter handles are releasing their own digital viruses as some form of unimaginable entertainment.”Twitter took down the posts and suspended the accounts concerned when the charity raised the alarm. The company is also looking at how it can better protect those whose epilepsy can be triggered by such images. It faces calls to ensure that users opt in to the automatic playing of gifs and videos, rather than opt out on the data usage tab of each device’s settings page, which some might find difficult to access.One triggering gif, sent in response to a person with epilepsy celebrating 263 days without a seizure, included the caption: “Time to break the streak babe”. Hashtags such as #seizures and #epilepsy were also used alongside the gifs to target those looking for support.One person told the charity on condition of anonymity: “I inadvertently viewed one of the posts and it triggered a simple partial seizure for me. This is not a joke. It is a physical assault on people struggling with epilepsy.”Another who experienced a simple partial seizure said: “Thankfully the incident did not trigger a convulsive seizure, but I’m afraid it might have for others who saw the images.”Thames Valley Police confirmed it was investigating the tweets as a hate incident under the Malicious Communications Act. It appeared to have been a deliberate attempt to cause harm to people who have epilepsy, the force said.A spokesperson for the National Police Chiefs’ Council said: “This was an awful incident in which people with epilepsy were targeted on social media on the basis of their difference, which we utterly condemn. We’re pleased an investigation is underway with Thames Valley police and would encourage anyone else affected to report to their local force.”A Twitter spokesperson said: “We want people to feel safe on our service. We provide people on Twitter with the option of preventing media from autoplaying in their timelines, as well as prevent any gifs from appearing when someone searches for “seizure” in the gif search.“Additionally, if Twitter determines accounts are dedicated to causing offline harm, they will be permanently suspended. We’re exploring additional options to help protect people on Twitter from this type of media.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/236c69411dbeb2a8936c5756d0b65c2a85dd5cd6/263_546_5561_3337/master/5561.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb813e4a99f2413011d6233d47623200","title":"uk theatres in high jeopardy as doors remain closed amid pandemic","story":"Leading figures call for government help as Covid-19 lockdown causes existential crisisBritish theatres are in a state of “high jeopardy” and some will go bust unless the government comes up with a specific package of help, leading figures in the industry have told the .Theatres are expected to be among the final organisations to open after the lockdown and, with warnings of physical distancing continuing at least until the end of the year, many fear they will not be able to properly operate until 2021.A shiver went through the sector when Southampton’s Nuffield theatre this month went into administration because of the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus. There will be more Southamptons without more help, regional artistic directors have said.Tom Morris, artistic director at Bristol Old Vic, said: “If you just look at the numbers, the threat is very vivid. Every theatre has faced a complete cliff edge in terms of its income.”Like other theatres, it is only hanging on because of the government’s furlough scheme. For the “terrifying period” in between that ending and being able to open up properly, the sector needs specific government support, Morris said. “We do not want to destroy British theatre by accident.”Morris, whose Bristol production of Touching the Void opened in the West End last year, said regional theatre was a vital talent pipeline for the UK’s world-leading creative sector.James Brining, the artistic director of Leeds Playhouse, said theatre was facing an existential threat. “There is so much uncertainty and that’s our biggest issue – how do you plan and what will the consequences of different scenarios be?” All theatres are busily modelling scenarios of allowing fewer people into buildings and having physically distanced audiences.The composer Andrew Lloyd Webber has reportedly warned that theatres cannot reopen with physical distancing measures in place in a letter to the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden.Adam Penford, the artistic director of Nottingham Playhouse, said his team had produced 25 different seating plans, none of which made any economic sense.That echoes comments by producer Cameron Mackintosh, who has predicted West End and Broadway theatre will not reopen until next year. “The truth is until social distancing doesn’t exist any more, we can’t even plan to reopen.”Penford questioned whether audiences would even want to sit in an auditorium with so many empty seats. “Is it the true experience of live theatre? Maybe people will adjust to it, maybe a blitz spirit will kick in. You’d have to test it, but it’s going to be an expensive test.”Penford is particularly worried that Nottingham’s pantomime may not happen and the consequences of that. “The pantomime is incredibly popular with our audience and we are very proud of it. It makes a really generous surplus every year. It is a fundamental part of our business model and we use the money to fund the rest of the year in terms of new and riskier artistic work.”One fear articulated by Penford and others is that after the lockdown, theatre may be more risk-averse. “It is a big worry,” he said. “I don’t want us to take a step back in terms of representation and access and championing emerging artists.”Daniel Evans, artistic director of Chichester Festival Theatre, said the situation for British theatre was one of “high jeopardy”.Chichester is better placed than others for physically distanced audience experiments in that it has a huge 1,300-seat main theatre. “Say we have 300-400 people in there and we could make some kind of production that wasn’t too costly … we can imagine that happening as an interim measure.”It is also examining using its lawn for physically distanced outdoor shows, and the car park as a drive-in cinema. “All these ideas are interim stuff, but I do think it would be helpful to try to test the waters to see what audience appetite is like, to see how audiences behave, but also to see if it is something we could develop until such time when we are back fully. And we will be back fully.”Evans said physically distanced programming in the main theatre would begin with comedy, cabaret, spoken word and physical theatre, which often requires little in the way of set or design. Outside, he is thinking of events that might cheer people up, along the lines of songs from the shows, or a mass quiz.Bolton’s Octagon theatre has a 400-seat auditorium, and having fewer people in would not work, said artistic director Lotte Wakeham. “We really do rely on audiences and people spending at the bar and using the cafe. That smaller audience model would be a real challenge.”The Octagon was due to reopen in the summer after a £12m refurbishment. That has now been delayed until at least October, blowing a £500,000 hole in its finances. “We’re starting to look at a scenario in which we might not be able to open until 2021,” said Wakeham. Most employees in theatres are furloughed, but most organisations are continuing their wider work in the communities that they serve.Brining said people were missing theatre. “I phoned around some of the older people’s groups, and it is really inspiring … They say, ‘Coming to the playhouse is what keeps me going.’ One lady said she’s going to donate to us because she’s not getting out now. It’s totally humbling.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acdb580c83c80fab273f4704b6fded63affad9a9/0_0_7323_4395/master/7323.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b060c1783708cce63e835097baf943fb","title":"tituss burgess interview kimmy schmidt netflix interactive","story":"The scene-stealing sitcom star on how Tina Fey rescued his career with a role in TV’s kookiest comedy, and what he’s really like behind the memesMuch like the shows he started out performing in on Broadway, Tituss Burgess’s own life story is full of fairytale-style twists. On his last day playing the small role of D’Fwan, a hairdresser and reality TV star on Tina Fey’s 30 Rock, he went home to his studio apartment in Hell’s Kitchen, New York. “I remember getting on my knees and sobbing,” he says down the phone from New Jersey. “I was sad but I was praying that I would be blessed with another series-regular role, because I felt like I had finally found a purpose.” Instead, Burgess was evicted from his home and moved to a basement flat in Harlem, putting his TV career on hold. “Five years later, I get a text from my manager, and she goes: ‘When was the last time you spoke to Tina Fey? Because either you’re about to get a job, or this is a cruel joke.’”His agent had received a breakdown for a character in a new ABC series (working title: Tooken) that seemed uncannily similar to himself: a down-on-his-luck actor and Broadway fanatic named Titus. Was Fey recruiting him for a lead role in her new show? Burgess still had to audition, having never been a series regular on network TV, but he landed the role, “and on my first day of filming, I was told to report to 52nd Street between Eighth and Ninth and that someone would take me to my trailer. My hand to God, my trailer was right outside of the apartment where I had prayed. It makes me teary thinking about it now.”If this sounds like a TV dream sequence, then perhaps it’s fitting that the show he’d been cast in would become one of the zaniest comedies around, with Tooken later evolving into the Netflix hit Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. With its dark premise (it follows Ellie Kemper’s title character as she rebuilds her life after being held hostage for 15 years by Jon Hamm’s crazed reverend), splashes of magical realism and Fey’s razor-sharp dialogue, it was both a soothing balm in an unpredictable world – and totally bonkers.At its centre, Kimmy’s roommate Titus Andromedon captured viewers’ hearts and launched a thousand memes with his constant zingers (“Black, gay, and old? I’m not even gonna know which box to tick on the hate crime form” “I envy you, I’ve never been able to meet me”). Ironically, the real Tituss was more than happy to leave the world of theatre – which he had been catapulted into after winning a talent contest back home in Georgia. His roles in shows such as Guys and Dolls and The Little Mermaid had been formative but left him feeling disillusioned.“I learned more about performing and producing than at any other time. But I think I went as far in that industry as I was going to be allowed to go,” he says. “And if I can be perfectly honest, there was what I call the ‘big black woman that stopped the show syndrome’. That is to say, the character that the show is not about comes in, razzle dazzle, and then disappears, and we don’t hear from them or see them ever again. I had no interest in doing that. So me and theatre went to couples therapy, if you will, and what emerged was a desire to see other people.”As Titus and Kimmy return for a final hurrah in an interactive feature-length special, Broadway’s loss is clearly TV’s gain. Burgess, a more reserved presence than his character, speaks lovingly of Fey (“I revere her’”) and his Kimmy Schmidt co-stars. It’s clear that the show was as much fun to make as it is to watch. But it hasn’t been without its challenges.“I’m probably the most boring of the rainbow of gay men, if you will,” he says. “When I meet someone who is expecting Titus Andromedon I apologise and oblige them with a photo if they ask for it, but it’s not been the easiest thing to navigate. I like to try and remind people that there’s a public persona and that there’s a private persona.” Burgess doesn’t go into a lot of detail, but it’s clear that there is something of a gap between himself and his character. While onscreen Titus rents a peacock to show off to his ex, the real Tituss has said he prefers not to be the centre of attention.His desire to separate himself from the role made it easy to bond with Daniel Radcliffe, who stars in the interactive special. “He’s spoken at length about choosing roles that are a departure from the wizard that people grew up with, and how people have had a hard time accepting him as a grown man,” says Burgess. “I think our job is to get to work and try to create opportunities for ourselves wherever we can and to remind people that we’re just actors.”Kimmy Schmidt is not the only thing Burgess has been working on. He’s the host of Quibi’s terrifying-looking contest Dishmantled, where chefs are pelted with foods that they have to recreate (Variety called it “deeply stupid”, though they noted that Burgess was charming as ever). Right before lockdown shuttered the entertainment industry, he finished filming a music-themed reality contest for Netflix in London, which he remains contractually tight-lipped about except to describe it as “probably one of the most fun on-camera experiences I’ve ever had”.He has also been in the voice booth for upcoming Apple TV+ animated comedy series Central Park, alongside Kristen Bell and Stanley Tucci has just finished making the Aretha Franklin biopic Respect, alongside Jennifer Hudson, in which he plays pastor and “king of gospel” James Cleveland and is about to release a dance track (he has made three albums to date, ning gospel, pop and R\u0026ampB). It sounds somewhat exhausting and he agrees. “On some level, I’ve appreciated the residual effect of the quarantine – which is mandated rest.”Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy v The Reverend is available on Netflix now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/056327f92e3fff94e9c3ab51501820e3ad20e649/0_240_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fad4913eb8cf7ce3ff8865114873ebf0","title":"wisconsin bars coronavirus stay at home order","story":"Wisconsin’s supreme court struck down the state’s stay-at-home order on Wednesday, and some residents took immediate advantage – by packing the bars.Videos and reports from some areas of Wisconsin showed some bars filled with revelers, most of them not wearing masks.A tweet from Nick’s Bar in Platteville, in the state’s south-west, showed people packed tightly together, some dancing, others slapping the bar top as music played. Bars were able to reopen after Wisconsin’s supreme court ruled in a 4-3 decision that the stay-at-home order should have been issued in consultation with the legislature, rather than as a governor’s edict.“It’s been kinda boring sitting in my house. I love my fiancee, but there’s only so much we can handle from each other without having interaction with other people,” Hayden Krueger told local news channel WDJT-TV at the Buzzard’s Nest bar, in West Allis, near Milwaukee. If any of the drinkers were wearing personal protective equipment, they were not captured in the WDJT-TV video.“It was a rough two months and we miss our customers. A lot of them are like family to us, and it was good to see a lot of familiar faces. It’s been a long time,” said Buzzard’s Nest owner Larry Prior.Bars in the state appeared to be following the less-than-sober advice of the Tavern League of Wisconsin, a non-profit trade association. “You can OPEN IMMEDIATELY!” the Tavern League told its followers on Facebook, shortly after the court ruling.The verdict by the conservative-majority court overruled the lockdown order put in place by Wisconsin’s Democratic governor, Tony Evers. Evers’ ruling was due to expire at the end of May, but the supreme court’s decision leaves inidual counties to determine their own fate. On Thursday, the governor urged people to continue to adhere to stay-at-home measures.“Folks, deadly viruses don’t go away on their own and they don’t go away because the supreme court says so,” Evers said in a radio address.“We cannot let this ruling undo all the work we have done and all the sacrifices Wisconsinites have made over these past few months.”Milwaukee and Green Bay in particular have experienced high rates of infection.Brown, Dane and Milwaukee counties, which account for some of the most populous areas of Wisconsin, swiftly imposed stay-at-home orders, but many of the state’s 72 counties chose not to do so, despite a warning from Evers on Thursday.The Iron Hog Saloon in the town of Port Washington opened its doors, serving food and drinks as people disregarded social distancing advice.“If people want to quarantine, quarantine. If you don’t want to quarantine, don’t quarantine. Go out, do what you normally do,” Iron Hog customer Gary Bertram told WISN ABC.Public health experts have disagreed with Bertram’s guidance.Iron Hog’s owner, Chad Arndt, said he had enhanced cleaning procedures before opening.

Teaching unions had been “absolutely right” to urge caution and prioritise testing before reopening schools on 1 June.“We cannot risk a second spike or take actions which would increase the spread of this virus, particularly as we see sustained rates of infection across the UK,” the BMA council’s chair, Chaand Nagpaul, said in the letter to his NEU counterpart, Kevin Courtney.The BMA said there was conflicting evidence from scientific studies on the effect of reopening schools, citing the “relatively small amount of research available and the uncharted territory we find ourselves in”. Nagpaul concluded: “Until we have got case numbers much lower, we should not consider reopening schools.”Meanwhile, Liverpool became the first local authority to rule out reopening its schools until at least 15 June, in a significant blow to the government.Liverpool’s move may encourage other local authorities to follow suit. With most state primary schools still maintained by councils, that could mean many schools missing the government’s 1 June target. Liverpool city council maintains 109 primary schools.Some academy chains have said they will go ahead on 1 June, however. Steve Chalke, founder of the Oasis multi-academy trust, which runs more than 30 primary schools, called the opposition to reopening “rather middle-class” and accused teachers’ unions of failing to recognise the harm being done to disadvantaged children.In the face of scepticism from teachers and school leaders, the government has increasingly raised the stakes in recent days. The education secretary for England, Gavin Williamson, wrote in the Daily Mail that teachers should be ready to “do their duty” and cooperate with the government’s efforts.Boris Johnson’s official spokesman said: “Safety comes first, but we must also be aware of the potential damage to a child’s education from not getting them back in the classroom.”Part of the government’s effort to win over the sector saw it hold a large virtual meeting on Friday between education leaders from colleges, schools and nurseries and top medical and scientific advisers, including Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, and Patrick Vallance, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser.But union leaders said they were “left with more questions than answers” after the meeting, which some participants said was at times confusing and chaotic, with around 50 people and organisations taking part. Some complained that their questions were not answered.Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, said the evidence presented to the meeting was “flimsy at best” but that there was room for further discussion.“This was never in our minds a make-or-break meeting, that was never its purpose. It’s for the government to demonstrate that the scientific advice is there, and then it’s for schools and government to demonstrate that schools will be safe for reopening, from whatever date,” Roach said.“It’s vitally important that the government and employers are behaving reasonably. It’s disappointing that many of the questions that we put to the scientific advisers this afternoon haven’t yet been answered. We hope that they will be answered – our members are hoping they will be answered.“The government has got to win the confidence of the profession, and it’s got to win public confidence as well, if parents are going to entrust their children into schools where there is a risk of greater transmission of the virus.”The NEU’s Courtney welcomed Vallance’s pledge to publish the papers presented to the Sage group of government advisers relating to education. But he also said the scientific advice presented to the meeting appeared mixed, and he was surprised to learn of instances in Australia where children had carried coronavirus cases into their households as “index cases”.“The things that they told us didn’t give me confidence that we should be going ahead without the social distancing and measures that schools in other countries have. It’s really not clear what the government’s test is to reopen schools,” Courtney said.The governments in Wales and Scotland remain unmoved by Westminster’s decision to reopen schools. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, said: “There will be no cavalier approach to any aspect of this on the part of the Scottish government.“It is not going to be the case that schools are back to normal in any way, shape or form this side of the summer holidays. We are of course discussing if it is possible for any pupils to be back in that timescale. But if it is, it is likely to be on a very limited basis.”Kirsty Williams, the Welsh education minister, also said no date had been set for schools there to reopen. But she announced the publication of a working document to stimulate discussion over how to reopen.“Setting a date before we have more evidence, more confidence and more control over the virus would be the wrong thing to do,” Williams said.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said at Friday’s Downing Street press conference: “I wouldn’t support a proposal to start to reopen schools unless it was safe to do so, and it is safe to do so.”He added: “In the same way that it’s terrible news that this virus impacts on the elderly so much, the good news is that it seems to spare children in almost every case. And so the the risk to children is much, much lower than to any other age group – certainly if you don’t have underlying health conditions.”The deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, said the falling number of cases across the community would reduce the risks further in coming weeks. “There’s a lot of anxiety I think around this, but people need to think through, in an average infant school of maybe 100 children, the likelihood of anybody having this disease is very small, and diminishing with time, so we just need to keep that in perspective.”Williamson said: “Getting children back to school is vital for their educational development and many schools are already taking steps to welcome back their pupils. I am grateful for their support.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2618ac23bf0c6ccbdef2b38e2a11855","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance may 15","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:European countries face a deadly second wave of infections in the winter, the World Health Organization’s top official in Europe says.Dr Hans Kluge, the director for the WHO European region, warned countries beginning to ease their lockdown restrictions that now is “time for preparation, not celebration”.

As new cases emerged in countries that relaxed their restrictions and businesses struggled to weather the storm, the World Health Organization warned that the disease may never go away.Vaccine hopes and fearsAn experimental vaccine that is being given to hundreds of people in an accelerated trial has passed an important milestone. A single shot of the Oxford University vaccine was found to protect a small number of monkeys from serious coronavirus infections. The six animals who received the jab produced antibodies to the virus within a month which appeared to prevent lung damage caused by the virus. The virus was still active in the nose, according to a preliminary report posted on the bioRxiv preprint server.The news came days after the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, conceded that there was no guarantee a vaccine would work, though his chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, was more upbeat, saying: “I’d be surprised if we didn’t end up with something.”A working vaccine is not enough if rich countries buy up all the shots and leave poorer countries unprotected. As a foretaste of the wrangling to come, Paul Hudson, the head of the French pharma company Sanofi caused an outcry when he told Bloomberg News that the US would have first dibs on any vaccine his firm discovered, since the US had funded much of the research. France’s minister of higher education, research and innovation, Frédérique Vidal, called the plan “disgraceful”.The Science Weekly podcast asks whether we need more than one vaccine. Hannah Devlin speaks to Prof Andrew Pollard about the work being done by different teams around the world to create a vaccine for Covid-19, and where his team at Oxford University fit into this international effort.

Johnson told people to return to work if they couldn’t work from home, even as the Office of National Statistics revealed that many of those in the PM’s sights – construction workers, cleaners, bus drivers and retail workers – were the most likely to die from Covid-19. The Trade Union Congress said the move put people’s health at risk as employers had only “vague and non-binding” guidelines on how to protect staff. The first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, led a chorus of disapproval and warned that the move was “potentially catastrophic”.Bewildered experts lambasted Johnson for ditching the simple advice to “Stay at Home” for the more puzzling instruction to “Stay Alert”. A group of behavioural scientists who were convened to advise the government made it clear the slogan hadn’t come from them. “Who is advising on the current messaging? Unfortunately it’s not us,” said one.As commuters packed on to trains and buses, David Hunter, a professor of epidemiology at Oxford University, warned that case numbers were not low enough to relax restrictions without risking a second wave of infections. Devi Sridhar, a professor of global public health at Edinburgh University, was similarly aghast, warning that without robust systems to test, trace and isolate those infected, the virus could spread through the population unchecked, resulting in “a Darwinian culling of the elderly and vulnerable”.Every African country now affectedHealth officials in Lesotho announced their first case of coronavirus, meaning the infection has now spread across the entire African continent. The virus was detected in one of 81 people tested after arriving from Saudi Arabia and South Africa.Lesotho went into lockdown on 29 March to prevent the virus spreading from South Africa which entirely surrounds the kingdom and has the most recorded cases on the continent.The latest tiff between the US president and Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, erupted over the speed at which the country is reopening. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, made clear that the virus was far from contained a day after Donald Trump declared that the nation had “prevailed” against the epidemic. In evidence to a Senate hearing, Fauci went on to warn of dire consequences if the US opened too soon and urged caution over reopening schools. President Trump did not approve. “To me it’s not an acceptable answer, especially when it comes to schools,” he told reporters.The president himself is taking no chances though. Staff in the West Wing, the operational centre of Trump’s administration, have been ordered to wear face masks except when at their own desks. Trump will not be wearing one. One of his valets and vice-president Mike Pence’s press secretary have both tested positive for the virus.Willie Walsh, the chief executive of the International Airlines Group, said British Airways would press ahead with cutbacks that could cost 12,000 jobs.

An R value above 1 means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which would result in a new surge of cases.It raises questions about the extent to which restrictions can be safely eased in coming weeks. In his address on Sunday, Boris Johnson said: “We have the R below 1, between 0.5 and 0.9 – but potentially only just below 1.”The slight increase and narrowing in range is not linked to lockdown relaxations this week as the estimate is based largely on hospital admissions and deaths data, which reflect the levels of transmission two to three weeks ago.A likely explanation is that while overall levels of infection have fallen, hospital and care home settings are making a relatively bigger contribution to the overall estimate of R. Lockdown restrictions have less impact in these settings and there are still concerns about the levels of testing available in care homes.The figure suggests that, while the lockdown has been effective at bringing down case numbers, R is still close to 1, meaning that it would not be possible to ease restrictions significantly without new measures to contain outbreaks, such as extensive testing and tracing.It comes as data showed that while London was a hotspot of infection at the start of the epidemic, attention is now shifting to the north of England, where transmission rates of Covid-19 appear to be falling far less steeply.Some epidemiological models suggest transmission rates in the capital are now half those seen in the north-east and Yorkshire, raising the question of whether all areas will be safe to emerge from lockdown at the same time.There is growing unease among civic leaders in the north of England at plans to ease lockdown rules, with one council leader branding it as “frankly, madness”.The leader of Gateshead council, Martin Gannon, said on Friday that the advice to the public to “stay at home” would continue. Gannon, whose views on lockdown were echoed by his counterparts in Newcastle and Sunderland, said there was evidence that the R rate was greater than 1 in his borough.How do models calculate the R value?The R value tells you how many infections each infected person passes the virus on to, on average. For an R above 1, the epidemic increases exponentially below 1 it will eventually fizzle out. In the absence of direct measures of this elusive number, modellers have to rely on what firm data we have and extrapolate from there.Some models, such as one by Public Health England (PHE) and Cambridge University, rely on the numbers of reported deaths, and the steep, steady decline in deaths in London translates into an estimate that community transmission must have also rapidly dropped off.Deaths are reliable figures, less subject to biases than some other measures, but they reflect the infection rates that were occurring about three weeks previously and so do not give a dynamic reflection of where things are.Policy changes around working and socialising introduced in the past week may have influenced R, but a model based on deaths will not give any insights into this. The PHE model projected that there might be as few as 24 new cases in the capital per day on 10 May. This reflects the strong downward trend London has been on, but the model is not designed to give razor-sharp predictions of day-by-day infection statistics. On Thursday, 49 people with new infections were admitted to hospitals in London.Some models rely on measures such as symptoms reported to phone apps, which have a shorter lag time. However, these data are more “noisy” and so give a less robust measure of R overall, although they can give better insight into short-range changes.The data from hospital admissions and deaths also suggest that R has come down far more steeply in London than in other regions. The PHE and Cambridge model suggests that R in London is 0.4, compared with 0.8 in the north-east and Yorkshire and 0.75 for the country as a whole.This is one of a handful of models feeding into advice from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to government, and all are showing broadly similar patterns across the regions. However, the extent of the differences varies, meaning that an optimistic estimate for London cannot be relied on too heavily.Matt Keeling, professor of populations and disease at the University of Warwick, described the PHECambridge estimate for London as “extremely low”. His own team’s predictions put the London R value closer to 0.6.“This still predicts a faster decline in London than the rest of the country, but not as dramatic … The difference between 0.4 and 0.6 might sound like scientists arguing over small details, but these translate to very substantial differences in the rate of decline of cases, or the time for the epidemic to halve,” he said.Initially, London was a few weeks ahead of other regions of the country because far more infections were seeded there at the start of the epidemic. However, it has also seen a steeper decline and, in fact, may have always had a slightly lower community transmission rate than some other geographical regions.There are likely to be a wide range of factors behind this. London may now have a higher level of population immunity, which could be playing a role in bringing down transmission, since a higher proportion of people have been infected.“If it turns out that there’s loads of immunity in the community, then that’s brilliant, but I don’t think we should plan for that scenario,” said Thomas House, reader in mathematical statistics at the University of Manchester. “We don’t really know yet.”There are also likely to be substantially different contributions from hospitals and care homes, where transmission rates have not been effectively brought under control. In some regions, the spread of infection in these settings, where lockdown does not have the same impact, could be making a major contribution to keeping R close to 1.Differences in living arrangements – for instance, larger family groups living together outside London – could play a role. Models may also not fully capture the role of underlying health issues and deprivation in raising the risk of severe cases.There isn’t strong evidence for this. The lockdown has brought down transmission rates in the community across the country, and a forthcoming study from scientists at Imperial College London does not seem to suggest that London has been an outlier in terms of compliance.“The uniformity with which the UK responded to the lockdown is remarkable,” said Steven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics. “I thought maybe people in London who were close to a large epidemic would be much more compliant than elsewhere. But the behaviour change was very well synchronised across the UK.”This is an emerging view among scientists. “Based on just the epidemiology, it makes a tremendous amount of sense,” said House. “There’s no point locking down if there’s no cases to prevent.” However, he and others acknowledge that the political decision will be weighted by factors beyond simply modelling the trajectory of case numbers.“It’s much more difficult to message the relaxation than it is to message the lockdown,” said Riley. “I suspect the most difficult aspect on possible regional differences is how you would message it. That uncertainty would be much greater than any mechanistic modelling uncertainty.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28f61ad99df0e5d2261ea8deec8cd1e6abaa1dae/0_81_3245_1948/master/3245.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dd3ee3f20636e73c63a0d88ae59db65","title":"taiwan must accept chinese status to attend who assembly says beijing","story":"Former European leaders say world needs Taiwan’s expertise in tackling coronavirus Beijing has stepped up the pressure on European states to reject Taiwan’s call to be represented at next week’s assembly of the World Health Organization, arguing that its presence can only be justified if it accepts that it is part of China.The World Health Assembly is being held virtually on Monday, and Taiwan’s attendance – as well as a possible international inquiry into the start of the pandemic – are likely to be the two big political flashpoints between China and the west.Chinese diplomats have been contacting governments across Europe to limit the diplomatic support for Taiwan’s attendance, targeting northern and eastern European states. Maintaining collective EU unity on China is proving difficult.But in a letter to the , the former Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former president of Poland Aleksander Kwaśniewski and the former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt argue that Taiwan should be permitted to attend because of its pioneering response to the pandemic, which has drawn on the lessons of the 2003 Sars outbreak.“It is regretful that geopolitics has prevented Taiwan from fully accessing the forums and services of the World Health Organization – not least as the WHO could have benefited from its expertise,” the authors argue.Taiwan had observer status at the WHO for seven years until 2016, when it was blocked by China, as it has been every year since. Beijing believes Taiwan is deploying the WHO issue as a route to recognition internationally.Donald Trump – locked into a multifaceted dispute with China – is already withholding US funds from the WHO, which he describes as “China-centric.”He has led the calls for Taiwan to be admitted to the UN body, and support is also coming from Australia, the UK, Japan, Canada, Germany and New Zealand. China is also concerned it may be losing the support of India on the issue.Rasmussen argues next week’s assembly could prove a turning point in the fight against coronavirus, saying the pandemic has underlined the importance of robust multilateral coordination.In the letter, Rasmussen claims Taiwan’s success in controlling the virus shows the country has lessons to teach the rest of the world, adding its attendance “will have no wider implications than to ensure that 23 million people with something to offer are not excluded from exchanging best practices”.Taiwan’s health minister, Chen Shih-chung, said on Friday his country could not accept China’s conditions for its participation.“We have no way to accept something that does not exist,” Chen replied, referring to China’s demand that Taipei agree to its “one China” policy to attend the assembly.WHO officials say the director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, cannot invite Taiwan since there are ergent views on the issue within.The EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, has called for an independent inquiry into the crisis, writing: “To strengthen our defences against future pandemics, we also need a thorough, independent scientific inquiry into the origins of the crisis.” China has been resistant, and the terms of any inquiry, as well as its timing, will be contested.Last month, Tedros himself accused Taiwan of racist “attacks” over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, an allegation that Taiwan denied as “unprovoked and untrue”.Tedros’s claim came after Taiwan said in March that the organization had ignored its December warnings that human-to-human transmission of coronavirus was possible.A WHO tweet on 14 January said: “Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.”But documents show that the international body warned the US and other countries about the risk of human-to-human transmission of Covid-19 as early as 10 January.The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian has dismissed claims of Chinese dominance at the WHO as rumour and smear-mongering."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/682e49e795dd5cb1823c4a93266d6ca27d0505ae/0_135_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6b19d02a7815ea019ca0d46ec4d906e","title":"us coronavirus message god poll results","story":"The coronavirus has prompted almost two-thirds of American believers to feel that God is telling humanity to change how it lives, a new poll has found.In the US, the virus has killed more than 80,000 Americans and caused economic hardship for millions, but the findings of the poll by the University of Chicago Divinity School and the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research indicate that people may also be searching for deeper meaning in the devastating outbreak.Even some who don’t affiliate with organized religion, such as Lance Dejesus of Dallastown, Pennsylvania, saw a possible bigger message in the virus.“It could be a sign, like ‘hey, get your act together’ – I don’t know,” said Dejesus, 52, who said he believes in God but doesn’t consider himself religious. “It just seems like everything was going in an OK direction and all of a sudden you get this coronavirus thing that happens, pops out of nowhere.”Kathryn Lofton, a professor of religious studies at Yale University, interpreted the high number of Americans perceiving the virus as a message from God about change as an expression of “fear that if we don’t change, this misery will continue”.“When people get asked about God, they often interpret it immediately as power,” said Lofton. “And they answer the question saying, ‘Here’s where the power is to change the thing I experience.’”Fifty-five per cent of American believers say they feel at least somewhat that God will protect them from being infected."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04d875dca2d16a42d6f85671441a1ca5ef2afbc7/596_710_4710_2827/master/4710.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f043cda83e9667ebf9a7b6eeaefb3e6","title":"us travel health insurance pandemic coronavirus","story":"The high cost of US healthcare means international travellers often buy travel insurance before visiting. But the policies don’t always cover health crises like the coronavirusThe fever, nausea and loss of appetite Vlastimil Gajdoš felt on his wedding day was not a mere case of cold feet.Gajdoš, 65, fell ill in Honolulu in March after arriving with his bride-to-be from the Czech Republic. He and Sylva Di Sandro, 58, intended to marry and honeymoon on the island.While they did tie the knot, they also engaged in serious battle with the novel coronavirus. He was in the hospital for two weeks, some of it in intensive care, on a ventilator. Like many visitors to the US, aware that healthcare prices can be higher than back home, Gajdoš purchased a travel insurance plan that covered up to $300,000 in medical expenses.But after Gajdoš was diagnosed with Covid-19 and his wife called to check whether his care would be covered, the newlyweds discovered a catch: the insurer said it would not pay up front. And it would consider reimbursing the couple only after Gajdoš was released from the hospital.The coronavirus pandemic has wreaked havoc on the travel industry – including insurance companies. Even beyond the current crisis, travelers should pay careful attention to the fine print on coverage policies.Many plans offer healthcare coverage in case a person needs medical attention during a trip. But policies vary tremendously by company – containing limits on payouts, co-payments and circumstances, such as whether they cover an evacuation.Most travel insurance plans contain exclusions for known or “foreseen events”, said Kasara Barto, a spokesperson for Squaremouth, an online service that allows travelers to compare insurance options.A regular insurance policy might not cover a mountaineering accident while climbing Everest, for example.Also common is the pandemic exclusion, in which the insurer will not pay for a traveler’s medical expenses if they are related to an outbreak such as the coronavirus.Language on exclusions can be vague, which could make it difficult for travelers to decipher whether their policy will pay for care related to Covid-19, industry experts said. To make matters worse, some policies don’t specifically name a pandemic as a circumstance that is covered or excluded – nor how they assess the start and end of a pandemic period.The World Health Organization declared the spread of the coronavirus a pandemic on 11 March. Travelers who purchased plans after that date should make sure they have medical coverage for Covid-19, said Christopher Mosley, a lawyer who specializes in insurance litigation at the law firm Sherman \u0026amp Howard.However, that cutoff date might be earlier in some policies. Some insurers considered Covid-19 a risk in certain areas as early as January, Mosley added.The risk is perhaps highest for foreigners visiting the US, which has the highest healthcare costs in the developed world. Many of the national health systems in European countries will treat foreigners for free or for much lower rates.Foreign embassies are stepping in to help their citizens in the US decipher insurance policies. In a notice, the Slovenian embassy in Washington DC specifically mentioned the high cost of healthcare when advising citizens traveling in the US to check whether their insurance covers pandemics. The Czech Republic intervened in Gajdoš’ case and at least one other time recently on behalf of citizens with health insurance problems, said Zdeněk Beránek, the deputy head of mission for the Czech embassy in Washington, DC.“This is not the cheapest country in the world when it comes to healthcare,” Beránek said, “so you better be careful.”Given the chaos of the pandemic, some insurers are choosing to stop selling travel insurance policies altogether – including LV, a company based in the United Kingdom.But others, such as Allianz, are expanding benefits to include care for Covid-19, according to a press release.Gajdoš and Di Sandro reached out to the embassy and his employer for help after his travel insurer denied him coverage. The employer pledged to help him if his plan did not cover his hospital stay, he said, but the government intervention worked. The insurer ultimately agreed to cover Gajdoš’s expenses.The couple would not disclose the final tally for Gajdoš’s hospital stay, but a typical 10-day course of treatment in an intensive care unit can run into several hundreds of thousands of dollars.He was discharged from the Queen’s medical center on 8 April, grateful for the care. Gajdoš said his insurer’s actions caught him off guard. He intentionally purchased a more expensive policy with the expectation that they would receive help, not pushback, from the plan.“You don’t have the energy,” Gajdoš said. “You are oriented on fighting for your life.”Kaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

He then moved swiftly on.The question referred to Boris Johnson’s claim during PMQs that it “wasn’t true” that as late as 12 March the care home sector had been advised that it was unlikely to face an outbreak. Labour has asked for the prime minister to return to the Commons to correct the record.Q. What does the government consider an acceptable level of risk when it comes to reopening schools?Q. What consequences would schools face if they refuse to reopen because the risk is too great?Hancock says reopening schools has to be “a team effort” and accepts it’s a “huge challenge”.Kanani says that risk is relative the government wouldn’t send children back unless it was safe to do so, which is why it will be phased and careful.Harries adds the risk should be kept in perspective. The likelihood of anyone having the disease by the time schools do reopen will be diminished.There are longer term health risks of not getting a good education, she adds. Hancock acknowledges that those in care homes who are working age and are clinically vulnerable need support. We’re rolling that out, he says.Harries adds there is a very stark variation in risk for the elderly, compared to all other variables.Q. Are people with learning disabilities being put at the back of the queue?Hancock says the government is following the clinical advice on inidual risks in terms of applying testing capability.Q. Why do you collectively appear quite relaxed that the R rate is up today, and the latest R rate suggests transmission of the disease might not be reducing? Will you reconsider the timetable for lifting England’s lockdown?Hancock says the R is based on data from several weeks ago so there is a lag, but it is still an important tool for policy makers. The R is still below 1, he adds.Harries adds that R is a very standard way of comparing what’s happening and is an important measure, but the real outcome we need is a reduction in the number of cases.It’s not just the R value, it’s the triangulation of all the evidence we have, she adds. It’s an important measure but not the only one.Q. On a day when the R is up, are you absolutely confident that allowing an easing of measures ahead of a sunny, warm weekend is the right decision?Hancock says R isn’t above 1, so it still meets the test.People must observe physical distancing measures, he adds. They are taking questions from the media now.Q. Are the measures you set out today too little too late, given the high numbers of deaths of care home residents?Hancock says throughout the crisis the government has supported those in care homes.Kanani adds primary care support for care home residents has been “ramped up” in recent weeks.Hancock says the R is being kept constantly under review.It’s one of the government’s five tests to keep the R below 1, he says. Current estimates are that it’s between 0.7 and 1, which still meets the test, he adds.Q. Anna from Worthing asks if the government recognises that nursing is a highly skilled profession that deserves better pay.Hancock says it is a highly skilled profession that deserves decent pay.He says pay for nurses went up last year. He adds that as health secretary he will “fight to have that fair reward” for nurses.They are taking questions from members of the public now.Q. Susanna from Oxford asks if the government’s alert level 1 - eradication of coronavirus in the UK - is a realistic target.In global terms, there isn’t an immediate easy outcome to achieve this, she says.Smallpox is the only disease we have eradicated, but having the ambition is good, she says.Understanding antibody response and immunity in the population, treatments and a vaccine are ongoing areas, she says. The immediate effort is to reduce the number of cases, she adds.The number of deaths confirmed with a positive test across all settings is steadily decreasing, Harries says.London had a severe and sharper rise in hospitalisations, this is coming down now, Harries says.Across the UK, the numbers are flattening off, she says, but we need to continue adhering to physical distancing measures to make good progress.Hospital admissions are falling but it is a “slow, careful” downward trend, so must continue to observe physical distancing, Harries says.Testing is on the rise, with 3,560 positive cases recorded in the last 24 hours, Harries says.Despite the rise in testing and increased likelihood of finding new cases, the number of new cases is continuing to come down, she says."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4253371.1589456907!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"primary schools must reopen it s time for parents to make their voices heard","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPupils listen to their teacher in a classroom of of the Saint-Exupery school in the Paris’ suburb of La Courneuve. This week,  primary schools in France re-opened  after an almost two-month closure. Photograph: Martin BureauAFPTwo weeks ago the Government published its roadmap for reopening society and business. In the 23-page document, its plans to keep schools closed until September merited just a footnote.On page eight, under education and childcare measures, are the words: “Commence opening on phased basis at the beginning of the academic year 202021: Primary and secondary schools universities, third level education centres and adult education centres.”There was no explanation as to why schools are to open last of all after offices, construction sites, garden centres, restaurants, bookies, bars and barbershops.There was even an acknowledgement in a footnote to the footnote that infections are “less frequently observed in children and that child-to-adult transmission appears to be uncommon”.QuestionableYet, the roadmap envisages schools remaining closed for the next four months. This approach is looking increasingly questionable.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s comments yesterday that reopening schools is “among the safest things that we can do over the next couple of months” has raised hopes that schools will open sooner rather than later.By sooner, parents and pupils mean the current school year and not in September.Mr Varadkar was maddeningly vague on the details. What does the “next couple of months” even mean? Is it now, next week, next month or in September?Does he understand that this kind of casual speculation only leads to false hope and disappointment among children who desperately want to go back to school?We have been here before. In April, Minister for Health Simon Harris said children might be able to go back to primary schools one day a week. The Irish National Teachers’ Organisation expressed a hope that children could return to school in June. What happened to those proposals?No explanation has been forthcoming because parents and pupils, the key stakeholders to use managerial jargon, are supposed to put up and shut up when it comes to Irish education.It is becoming clear that the high-handed and peremptory decision to close schools until September, without keeping the situation under review, was unnecessary.The medical reasons for it look increasingly tenuous. A study by the Health Information and Quality Authority concluded, albeit from limited evidence internationally: “It appears that children are not, to date, substantially contributing to the household transmission of SARS-CoV-2. From one study, SARS-CoV-2 transmission in children in schools is also very low.”The Taoiseach suggested yesterday after a meeting with the World Health Organisation’s Dr Mike Ryan, that it would not be a “good reflection on us as a society to be the last people who are able to re-open our schools and re-open our childcare facilities”.Only Italy and Spain in Europe have planned to keep their schools closed until September and they have been hit hardest of all by the coronavirus pandemic.We have the spectacle at present of the horse racing and vintners’ representative groups lobbying the Government to reopen earlier than planned.Who will speak for the 500,000 primary school pupils in this country who have seven weeks of schooling left? Why should they have to wait?TransitionBy the time schools return in September, if they do, these children will have been out of the classroom for almost six months.\u0026nbspChildren in sixth class will make the huge transition to secondary school without the careful preparation needed for such a change.While the public debate has been fixated about the fate of the Leaving Certificate, primary school children too are suffering stress and have had their lives upended by this pandemic.If there are sound reasons why schools cannot go back until September, these reasons have not been explained to the Irish public.The chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan acknowledges there have been many studies carried out which justify the contention that children are not major spreaders of the disease and are not adversely affected by it.However, he would not budge on the health advice that schools should remain closed.“It is an entirely different thing to conclude in policy terms that we have enough evidence to say that transmission from children doesn’t occur but as yet it hasn’t been identified as a significant issue in the small number of studies that have been done,” he said.Dr Holohan wants evidence-based public health policy. So do we. He should, therefore, point to the studies that show children are significant spreaders of Covid-19 and that it constitutes a significant health threat to them.He might explain why the Republic cannot follow Denmark where children went back to school almost a month ago.The experiment there has worked to date. The Danish R0 has continued to decrease from 0.9 to 0.7 since the schools reopened and pupils in middle school are also returning.They are also returning this week to school in Belgium, the Netherlands and France, three countries which have higher mortality rates than Ireland from Covid-19.In Switzerland primary schools started back on Monday. The country’s public health spokesman Daniel Koch justified this decision succinctly: “It is very rare for children to transmit and get the disease. Children very rarely infect other children. The situation is stable and there is no contradiction that the schools are reopened - it is understandable and correct.”If the Government and the National Public Health Emergency Team know something about the danger of sending primary school children back to school that the rest of Europe does not know, they should share it with us.StrainThere is still time for primary school children to get a meaningful education this year. It is not just education they are missing school is a huge part of their socialisation.The absence of routine is causing a huge strain. That strain will only get worse as the economy starts to reopen.How are those parents who are expected to go back to work on May 18th, June 8th and June 20th supposed to provide childcare for primary school pupils?The closure of primary school needs to end sooner rather than later.There is a fear among parents that schools will stay shut until September, not because it is the best option for children - it clearly is not - but because it is the most convenient one.Parents need to make their voices heard on this issue. Things cannot go on as they are going on.

Video: UCD Enda O\u0027Dowd\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA woman wearing a face mask  at street market in  Marseille, France earlier this month. Photograph: Christophe SimonAFPGettyWhere do face masks fit into the Covid-19 response picture?The average punter going about their daily restricted business probably wants to continue contributing to the national effort on curbing the spread of Covid-19 but is finding the “we’re in this together” bit a little grating by now.Thoughts have turned to re-emergence but there is utter confusion about whether to wear a mask or not in public.Unofficial advice varies wildly from the local expert declaring they don’t make a whit of a difference in curbing spread of the virus to strong believers in science who say a homemade cloth mask, even a folded scarf, works.There is a third cohort who politely suggests wearing them is good respiratory etiquette at this time as we will be closer to other people who will inevitably cough or sneeze.During the early stage of the pandemic, the World Health Organisation said there was little evidence to support the wearing of masks in public. There was plenty to suggest people in non-medical settings put them on and take them off incorrectly, and so facilitate Covid spread.What’s more, they provide a false sense of security, they declared, and people tended to ease off on other actions – especially on “wash your hands” and physical distancing. But much has changed since.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention broke ranks after seeing new evidence, notably on droplet spread outlined by the New England Journal of Medicine – a small video clip instantly change attitudes in favour of masks.Upwards of 50 countries struggling in coming to terms with Coronavirus decided to make wearing of masks mandatory. Meanwhile health authorities in Asian countries – well used to tackling epidemics where masks are worn routinely – looked on in disbelief at the failure to give clear instructions as cases mounted in Europe.The health message even got caught up in the latest American culture war with many liberals and conservatives taking opposing sides, much as they have on climate change.But the horrible unpredictability of coronavirus invariably asserts itself. This week it prompted less politically-motivated people to switch to wearing them.Just look at how White House staff have started using masks after recent cases were confirmed at the highest levels of government – though their boss continues to go without.Meanwhile growing numbers of mask wearers view mingling mask-free in public places as both offensive and unhealthy a social “No-No”. For some who wear them, it’s in response to what the science is now saying as they see it. That trend has grown in Ireland in spite of lack of clarity from public health authorities.What is the scientific case for wearing face masks?A growing number of prominent infectious diseases specialists now believe the scientific case for wearing them has shifted appreciably in their favour, though evidence is based on small studies.Science is rarely black and white, however, it’s about evaluating risk and probability based on the evidence. Not all agree on what the latest research is saying.That said, applying the precautionary principle, including the concept of doing no harm, shifts the weight further in favour. Some of the UK most eminent scientists (and epidemiologists) published analysis last week suggesting “their use could reduce onward transmission by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic wearers if widely used in situations where physical distancing is not possible or predictable”.That means if you have the disease and are showing no symptoms, or are at the very early stages of getting it, you can prevent spread to another person by wearing a mask. This is in contrast to the standard use of masks “for the protection of wearers”.Their verdict was emphatic: “If correctly used on this basis, face masks, including homemade cloth masks, can contribute to reducing viral transmission.”What are the key differences between masks?Medical-grade masks provide excellent protection in surgery or dealing with patients with highly infectious diseases such as Covid-19 where healthcare staff cannot maintain physical distancing.Also known as respirator masks, they must be worn with other PPE, such as gowns, aprons, gloves and visorsshields.Their filter capacity means they remove viruses and bacteria in the vast majority of cases, especially minute levels of a bug contained in a droplet that might be transmitted in a cough, sneeze or saliva.Typically, they are referred to as N95 – filtering out at least 95 per cent of particles of all sizes from the air – FFP2 and FFP3 masks. Designed for single use and not cheap, they are like gold dust in the throes of a pandemic.Cloth masks, non-medical masks made from strong tissue and dust masks (usually worn to stop construction workers or decorators from breathing in dust particles) provide nowhere near the same level of protection but increasingly it is believed they are of benefit in public settings.A bandana can stop 15 per cent more of your cough. While a cloth mask with no filter could give 70 to 80 per cent coverage. Another study found a cloth mask can trap 95 per cent of “viral load”.How have the WHO and NPHET responded to the changed scenario?The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), which advises the Government on how to respond to Covid-19 has remained firmly in the WHO camp both remained to be convinced but indicated recently they were reviewing their advice in light of latest research.There is no doubt that acute shortages of medical-grade masks – and escalating cost – is a big factor in this. Shifting attention away from key actions that force down transmission rate is probably another.NPHET is about to provide its updated advice which will support mask-wearing in a non-compulsory way, though the scientific argument in favour of their widespread use has strengthened. It will be followed up with guidance on types of masks and how to wear them in public health messaging.The chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan indicated this week there may be a role for wearing face masks in retail settings, on public transport and elsewhere that social distancing is challenging.Already, there is much reference to the public wearing face “coverings” as if to make an important distinction from specialist face masks.Both have shifted to accepting there are benefits from wearing them in some circumstances. That said, it is far short of the strong advice in many countries and cities, including those who are making it a mandatory requirement if going about in public with fines for those not adhering to the decree.Should the advice be more emphatic... should it have come sooner?Given hundreds of thousands of people are likely to be out and about more in coming weeks, it can be argued that wearing face masks will help reduce transmission of Covid-19, though cases will rise as lockdown is eased.Moreover, it would reduce risk of resurgence in the form of Coronavirus 2 in months to come. The “super-spreader” is a constant risk, especially where there is slow processing of tests and poor contact tracing.In that scenario, there was a case for issuing clear guidance sooner, so people could make masks or source them elsewhere and get used to wearing them properly. In addition, because the main benefit of a cloth mask is to protect other people, it only works if most people are wearing them.Obviously masks will have to be provided for older people and those with underlying conditions.The homemade mask is more than adequate if going out an about where you cannot maintain physical distancing.And they have the benefit of multiple use – after washing in a high temperature. There are many guides to making these masks online. Even at its most basic a folded scarf and two elastic bands does the trick.Using stronger material and two layers while ensuring the mask is not too tight but easily covers the nose and mouth is advisable.Where can basic masks be located?Commercially-made cloth masks are available online and in many retail outlets ranging price from €5 to more than €20 each likewise higher grade masks including some used in healthcare settings – which must be a source of concern to health authorities given persisting PPE shortages. They may look flimsy but they are made with two pieces of strong tissue with a breathable plastic filter in between, and can be worn over a longer period though not reusable.Dust masks are available in DIY stores and online. Sometimes they have an air valve which make them less effective – they are not reusable.So what’s the bottom line, should we go the whole way and make masks mandatory?Many infectious disease specialists and immunologists who are becoming increasingly aware of Covid-19 devious characteristics would say yes.Ireland needs to make the wearing of masks mandatory and there is a particular risk essential workers, including gardaí, could become super- spreaders, according to disease control expert Prof Gerry Killeen of UCC. “I wince every time I see a well-meaning Garda without a mask at a checkpoint,” he said this week.They should be made mandatory immediately, “but not necessarily everywhere or all the time”.Widespread use should be encouraged, he believes. It’s ideal to always assume one may be quietly carrying and shedding the virus and behave accordingly.He would like to see masks made absolutely mandatory for anyone working in any essential service, especially anyone handing food, stacking shelves, moving goods, or working in any venue visited by members of the public.The critical issue is to cut down on transmission between households and across the communities through contamination of the spaces, surfaces and goods we share with others.Is this mass exercise in the interest of the public health of citizens doable?This pandemic has prompted a remarkable response form the public at household level in particular. We took on board complex health messaging and acted appropriately. That curve was flattened and R0 - the number of people infected by a single carrier - forced down below 1. We were surprisingly good at understanding medical science.We can do it again in wearing basic face masks in public settings in the right way, and understand it is just one part of the armoury to be deployed at this phase of re-engagement with one another in a gradual way.It is not as effective as washing your hands, not touching your face and maintaining physical distancing but wearing face masks can play its part in crushing Coronavirus in months to come.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4254812.1589576246!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"almost 6 200 capsules claiming to treat symptoms of covid 19 seized by garda%C3%AD","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe follow-up search operation was conducted on May 8th at a house in Swords, Co Dublin.

customs officers and vets, who would be dealing with livestockUnionist politicians have responded with annoyance and dismay after a junior Sinn Féin Minister told a Stormont committee that there will be new physical border posts at Northern Ireland ports.An “Irish Sea border is now a certainty”, the Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken said on Thursday following comments by Sinn Féin Minister Declan Kearney that border posts are to be created to deal with trade coming into Northern Ireland from Britain.Mr Kearney told the Assembly’s Executive Office scrutiny committee that the “British government has confirmed it will urgently put in place detailed plans with the Executive, which does include the physical posts at ports of entry”.Mr Kearney informed former Sinn Féin MEP Martina Anderson that the British government had signalled that “delivery on that infrastructure needs to start as soon as possible”.“The British government has indicated that it will provide advice on the requirements and the funding to put that in place.”Ms Anderson, in her questioning of Mr Kearney on Wednesday, indicated the posts would be at Belfast, Larne and Warrenpoint and would be designed to accommodate additional customs officers and vets, who would be dealing with livestock.ChecksWhile it appeared implicit in the EU-UK deal that allowed for Brexit to proceed that there would be checks on some goods and livestock coming in from Britain, unionist politicians have campaigned against any such border at Northern Ireland ports.He said his party had warned “this was sadly inevitable” if the British government continued with the deal it struck with the European Union.“It is unforgivable that we have ended up here,” said Mr Aiken. “For all the big talk and bluster, Northern Ireland will now have to deal with border control posts at our ports and airports.“This places a huge burden on businesses here who will be expected to be totally prepared for the changes in just over seven months time, amidst the crisis many are currently facing due to Covid-19,” he added.Mr Aiken said that EU “intransigence” also played a big role in creating the current situation.‘Mettle’Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister said Mr Kearney’s “claim” about new posts suggested that “unionists at the Executive face a major test of their mettle”.A British government spokesperson said it had “always been clear that there will be requirements for live animals and agri-food, building on what already happens at ports like Larne and Belfast”.“We want to work with Northern Ireland businesses and the Executive to ensure new administrative procedures are streamlined and efficient,” the spokesperson added.The SDLP Brexit spokeswoman Claire Hanna said that checks at Northern Ireland ports should come as no surprise as it was clear for a long time that this must happen. “This is an inevitable consequence of Brexit,” she said.Ms Hanna said the proposals gave “a little bit of comfort” that if there were checks at Northern Ireland ports that North-South trade could happen seamlessly.She said that the proposals contradicted previous British government commitments about there being “unfettered” trade across the Irish Sea after Brexit.“The only way to minimise the checks in the Irish Sea is to soften Brexit overall,” added Ms Hanna.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues

Video: RTÉ\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar: ‘I can confirm that it is safe to proceed with phase one.’ Photograph: Dave Meehan for The Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has announced that the first phase of the lifting of the Covid-19 restrictions is to go ahead next Monday.At a press conference in Government Buildings on Friday afternoon, Mr Varadkar indicated that the phased lifting of the restrictions, which have brought social and commercial life to a standstill since their introduction in March, will begin as scheduled after the weekend.“I can confirm that it is safe to proceed with phase one,” Mr Varadkar said. He said that the Cabinet had approved the changes this morning, and he had notified the Stormont administration afterwards.The next phase for reopening is due on Friday, June 5th, but Mr Varadkar this depends on the successful containment and suppression of the virus over the coming weeks.The Taoiseach said that the Government was advising people to wear face coverings on public transport and in crowded places indoors, but this will not be a legal requirement.However, the Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan warned that face coverings did not provide “some kind of magic shields against the disease”.Minister for Heath Simon Harris said that the existing restrictions had avoided a disaster and saved thousands of lives. He said that observing the continuing restrictions would be necessary if Ireland is to avoid a second wave of the virus.He advised against everyone rushing to garden centres at once, and urged people to maintain social distancing rules.From Monday members of the public are advised to stay at home, and avoid unnecessary journeys, except for the following five reasons:1. To go to work, if your place of work is open and you cannot work from home 2. To shop for items you need 3. To exercise within 5km of your home 4. For medical reasons or to care for others 5. To meet friends or family outside, within 5km of your home, in groups of no more than fourGrey areasAccording to phase one of the Government’s roadmap for reopening, garden centres, farmers’ markets, will reopen as well as opticians, motor and bicycle repair shops and phone repair shops.Outdoor workers in construction can return including gardeners and those working in allotments.Up to four people who don’t live together can meet outdoors while keeping at least 2m apart.Minister for Business Heather Humphreys warned businesses that they must be in a position to enforce social distancing and other safety measures before they can open. The Health and Safety Authority would supervise and enforce the rules, she said.Ms Humphreys also announced a €250 million fund to supply grants to small businesses to enable them to reopen.“If you have a hardware shop and you happen to have a small homeware section, you are allowed to sell, OK? But if you are a homeware shop, and that’s your main line of business, you can’t,” Ms Humphreys said.“We appreciate that there are going to be grey areas, and there are going to be difficulties,” Mr Varadkar said. “But we hope to iron those out over the next couple of days.”If you need to buy a new pair of curtains, you can wait a couple of weeks,” Mr Harris added.Now is not the time to decide I’m going to dicky up the house or buy a new pair of curtains,” he added.Mr Varadkar said that hardware shops were being only opened because it was necessary for construction to reopen.Mr Varadkar said that horseracing behind closed doors would be permitted to take place from June 8th, which was “taking into account what’s happening in the UK, what’s happening in France”.“This is a big economic sector, lots of people employed in it worth nearly half a billion euros to the economy each year and . . . we need to aligned or more or less aligned with what’s happening in the UK and France.”Covering facesFace-coverings should be worn in indoor settings where social distancing cannot be practised to limit the spread of coronavirus, public health officials recommended to Government earlier on Friday.The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) has also given the green light to the planned easing of restrictions from next Monday, The  understands.The deaths of another 10 patients were announced by Nphet at its briefing on Thursday. There have now been 1,506 Covid-19 related deaths in the Republic. The total number of cases is now 23,827.The Cabinet meets on Friday to discuss the package of recommendations from NPHET, which sources say contains “no surprises”.The measures are then expected to be announced at a press conference attended by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Minister for Health Simon Harris and chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan on Friday evening.The proposal for people to wear face-coverings will be optional and is intended as an “additional hygiene measure” on top of existing advice on handwashing and social distancing.NPHET’s advice, which will be the subject of a major public information campaign, stresses that not all people can wear face-coverings and no-one should be stigmatised for not doing so.AdviceThe campaign is also expected to provide advice to people on making their own face-coverings so that the supply of health-grade face-masks is not affected.A growing number of prominent infectious diseases specialists now believe the scientific case for wearing them has shifted appreciably in their favour, though evidence is based on small studies.It is understood that the Government will seek to clarify the change in restrictions that will allow four people from different households meet outside.Some sources suggested that it may be recommended that people only meet in groups of four once a day, although this has yet to be confirmed, rather than meeting in different groups at different times throughout the day.It was also stressed that it will not mean people can, for example, have guests over for barbecues. This would entail people from different family units using the bathroom in another person’s home, one source suggested.It is also emphasised this will not mean people will be allowed visit the homes of friends or family. “We don’t want people in other people’s homes,” a source said.“The five kilometre travel limit and social distancing will also apply to such meetings.”RoadmapAccording to phase one of the Government’s roadmap for reopening society and business, if medical advice allows, Monday, May 18th will see the beginning of phase one. It means garden centres, farmers’ markets, will reopen as well as opticians, motor and bicycle repair shops and phone repair shops. Outdoor workers in construction can return including gardeners and those working in allotments. Up to four people who don’t live together can meet outdoors while keeping at least two metres apart.When asked about how long the current pandemic payment would continue, Mr Donohoe said on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that government has not yet made a decision about an extension to the payment. Evaluations will have to be made about what the government might be able to offer in the future, he said.“We want to recognise the strain and worry that people are experiencing and to assure them we will try to keep jobs.”The level of intervention now in place had been enabled by the great care taken of the public finances in recent years, he said.As soon as the government understands how the economy is responding it will better understand the economic consequences of the pandemic payments, he said.“We want to see the effect of the reopening first.”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told the Dáil on Thursday the Government was increasingly confident that phase one of easing restrictions would go ahead on Monday.He said the virus “is a fire in retreat. We must quench its every spark and stamp out every ember”.Speaking in the Dáil during a debate on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic he said “we are still in phase zero, The moment we assume progress is inevitable, we risk going backwards.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4253815.1589485531!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"london criticises eu s limited progress in implementing parts of brexit deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCabinet office minister Michael Gove has expressed concerns about  ‘limited progress’ in the implementation of parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement by EU member states. File photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireBritain has written to the European Commission to express concerns about “limited progress” in the implementation of parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement.The complaint concerns the rights of UK citizens living in the EU, and was expressed in a letter from cabinet office minister Michael Gove to commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic sent as a week of talks between negotiators on the future EU-UK relationship comes to a close.The letter accuses EU member states of failing to provide resident British citizens with clear information about their rights and obligations, giving short deadlines to apply for the EU Settlement Scheme, having slow or unclear application procedures, and lacking support for vulnerable UK nationals.“The themes highlighted above relate to inidual member states. Nonetheless the withdrawal agreement places obligations on the EU as a whole,” the letter states.“When viewed cumulatively these themes amount to a serious risk that the EU will not fulfil its obligations under the withdrawal agreement by the time the transition period ends on December 31st, 2020. We are already seeing several instances of misapplication of the withdrawal agreement within the EU.”The letter contrasts failures in member states with steps taken to accommodate EU citizens in Britain, where, it says, the government has set up a phone line, given 27 months for applications for settled status, and made available support for vulnerable EU citizens.Past accusationsThe criticism from the UK echoes past accusations by chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, who has slammed London for failing to engage seriously with future relationship negotiations and has warned that implementation of the withdrawal agreement, particularly the development of checks for goods entering Northern Ireland, is vital for a deal to be reached in these talks.A British government spokesman denied the letter was linked to the negotiations, and said it intended to set out London’s position ahead of a meeting by a joint EU-UK specialised committee on citizens’ rights next week.“Citizens’ rights have always been a priority for the UK. We take our obligations to protect citizens’ rights very seriously, and expect the EU to do the same,” the spokesman said.The European Commission this week published guidelines on citizens’ rights for member states, intended to help them implement the withdrawal agreement, which protects the status of both British citizens living in the EU and EU citizens living in Britain.On Thursday, the British Irish Chamber of Commerce called on the London government to seek an immediate extension of the Brexit transition period to avoid a lurch to default trade terms in January, which it warned would “decimate” businesses when combined with the coronavirus pandemic.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

It wants protections of environmental standards and labour rights to be part of the deal, to avoid British industry undercutting EU competitors.Mr Frost said such commitments would bind Britain to EU laws and standards in a way that is unprecedented in other free trade agreements.“It is hard to understand why the EU insists on an ideological approach which makes it more difficult to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. We very much need a change in EU approach for the next round beginning on June 1st. In order to facilitate those discussions, we intend to make public all the UK draft legal texts during next week so that the EU’s member states and interested observers can see our approach in detail,” he said.Both sides agreed that there had been slight movement on the issue of fisheries, where each had begun with polar opposite positions, the EU advocating for a continuance of the status quo and Britain insisting it would reclaim exclusive rights for its fishing industry alone in its territorial waters.\u0026nbspTalks on finding a compromise will resume in the next round of negotiations, which begin on June 1st.Britain will next week publish the draft legal texts it has shared with EU negotiators but not with member-state governments. It will also publish a document outlining how it plans to implement the Northern Ireland protocol.‘A bit tetchy’A senior British official close to the negotiations said this week’s talks were “a bit tetchy at times”, adding that Mr Barnier was doing a good job but was burdened with a negotiating mandate that was not negotiable with Britain.“The problem continues to be that the EU think that they can get a halfway house between what we’re willing to see on so-called level playing field and what they’re willing to see, what we’re willing to live with on fisheries and what they’re wanting to see. We tried to make clear from the start that there isn’t a halfway house. You can’t split the difference between areas where we control our own laws and that’s a fundamental difficulty that the EU has not yet accepted,” the official said.After weeks of stalemate and a tight negotiating timetable that was curtailed further by the coronavirus pandemic, calls have grown for Britain to request an extension to the transition period to give the talks more time, which survey data indicates has majority public support.\u0026nbspThe British Irish chamber of commerce appealed to the government of prime minister Boris Johnson to buy time so that businesses were not burdened with tariffs and regulations while at their “most vulnerable”.The British government has insisted it will not ask for an extension, and last week cabinet minister Michael Gove said that tariffs were a “price” London was willing to pay.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The number of deaths is halving roughly every week.The figures show that London, at one point the worst-hit region in the country, is now ahead in terms of recovery. The North-East has 4,000 daily infections and an \u0027R\u0027 rate twice that of the capital, and on Thursday night MPs said the data suggested lockdown could be eased region by region.Bim Afolami, a Conservative MP, said: If you look at other countries, they\u0027ve often adopted regional approaches. If it makes sense from a health perspective, we need to consider it.Mr Afolami pointed out that the devolved regions had already differed in policy during the virus crisis, adding: Within England, we should consider regional approaches too.Theresa Villiers, a former Cabinet minister, said: These figures are good news. They show lockdown measures have been working, and I think they make the case for further easing of the lockdown in London.It\u0027s vital that we do find ways to let the economy recover – and London is the powerhouse of the economy.The analysis has been given to Government scientists and regional PHE teams to help them forecast the trajectory of the epidemic in their areas.The \u0027R\u0027 rate represents the number of people one contagious person will infect. It is crucial it is kept below one to stop the disease spreading exponentially. The new figure suggests that, in London, for every 10 people who get the virus, it is passed on to just four.The current \u0027R\u0027 rate for the whole of England is 0.75. The North-East and Yorkshire have the highest infection rate, at 0.8, but the regional breakdown suggests coronavirus is declining everywhere since the UK went into lockdown on March 23.Daily new cases across England are around 11,500 a day, down from 527,000 a day including those with mild or no symptoms.Many communities have expressed concern that day trippers from London will spread the virus during visits to beauty spots this weekend after social distancing rules were partially relaxed.However, the data suggest the bigger threat may now be to Londoners from those elsewhere in the country.The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) is known to be considering regional lockdowns if a local \u0027R\u0027 rate rises above one, and the new figures show that such a policy would be possible and even useful in keeping large parts of the economy open.However, Steve Brine, a former health minister, argued that restrictions should be lifted for all areas at the same time.The country should move together, Mr Brine said. This shows the restrictions have had the desired effect – London is ahead of the rest of the country, so this is an encouraging sign.The figures also reveal that by time the country went into lockdown the \u0027R\u0027 rate in London was already falling, possibly helped by social distancing and home working, which had been in place at least a week earlier.But the number of people becoming infected was still high in the regions when Britain was shut down. While the \u0027R\u0027 rate was 2.3 in London on March 23, it was 3.41 in the North-East and Yorkshire.The report, published this week by the Medical Research Councils Biostatistics Unit at Cambridge University, rather than by the Government, has left some MPs questioning whether they are being shown all the evidence.The Tory MP Steve Baker, who sits on the Commons Treasury select committee, said: This means the Government really must publish fully and frankly the underlying advice and data, so we can have a full public consultation.All this black box policy-making isn\u0027t working for the country. It\u0027s not fair on the nation to see leaks of models, which create the impression the Government isn\u0027t going far enough fast enough when the public\u0027s jobs are at stake.Far better to get all the data, modelling and advice out in the public domain at the first opportunity.A separate study from a team at the University of Manchester suggests that 17.3 million people in Britain may have already been infected with coronavirus, putting the county well on the way to herd immunity.Dr Adrian Heald, of the university, said: This gives us all a glimmer of hope that there may be light at the end of the tunnel. The more people exposed to this or any virus, the less easy it is for further transmission.The Manchester team said the regional variations in the data should allow the Government to bring in local releases from the lockdown.Dr Heald added: This will allow policymakers to avoid a \u0027one size fits all\u0027 approach to pandemic policy, which does not consider the variation in both infection rates and impact across localities.The \u0027R\u0027 rate is calculated from intensive care unit hospital admissions, death figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and the Care Quality Commission as well as behavioural contact surveys, incidents of patients testing positive and serology studies to see who has already developed antibodies.Researchers argue that incremental lifting of the social restrictions as soon as possible is vital in order to minimise further damage to the economy and the impact of prolonged social containment.When London suffered an early wave of infections, the regions were believed to be around two weeks behind – suggesting their \u0027R\u0027 rates will also begin to drop drastically in the next fortnight.A spokesman for PHE said London\u0027s epidemic was further ahead of the rest of the country and so was dying off earlier.The research also suggests that more than 6.5  million people have acquired the virus since the beginning of the epidemic – around one in 10 of the population.Separate data from the ONS, released on Thursday, showed that at any given time between April 27 and May 10, around 0.27 per cent of the population was infected, an average of 17,820.     More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"1500 18000 strong army contact tracers has recruited minister","story":"Just 1,500 of the Government’s target 18,000 contact tracers have been hired, a Government minister has admitted.Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland Secretary, told Sky News: I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve got to 18,000 just yet, I think there\u0027s about 15,000 applications, we\u0027re looking to as you say get up to 18,000.Pushed again on how many of the  applicants had been appointed, he added: As of this morning I\u0027m not sure of exactly how many of the 15,000 have been hired, earlier in the week it was about 1,500, it would have gone up since then.The admission suggests that the Government is nowhere near rolling out the track and trace system it said would be ready by mid-May.The Department of Health and Social Care had announced that the 18,000 staff would  be “available from the week commencing May 18” and would be ready to work when the new NHS tracing app is rolled out nationwide.The app which is currently being trialed on the Isle of Wight has already suffered technical problems.More than half of the island’s residents - some 70,000 - have downloaded the NHSX software.The app uses Bluetooth to detect when a person\u0027s phone has been near another owned by someone reporting symptoms of Covid-19, sending a notification to the user and offering them advice on what to do to prevent spreading the disease. Those with Covid-19 symptoms can also use it to order a swab test.Of the army of 18,000 contact tracers, 3,000 will be qualified public health and clinical professionals and the remaining 15,000 will be call handlers trained to follow scripts devised by Public Health England.App users who report symptoms will be interviewed by a contact tracer, who will then also contact others who may have been infected.They will then be told to monitor their symptoms or isolate and seek testing, depending on their level of exposure.Ministers hope contact tracing will reduce transmission by identifying and alerting people who may have been exposed to the virus, so that they can protect themselves and others around them by self-isolating.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hottest ticket town national trust set scramble launches online","story":"Passes to attend National Trust venues are set to be the hottest ticket in town as sites are set to reopen for those who pre-book.The system, open for all potential visitors and not just members, is set to be first-come-first served and is aimed at ensuring sites are only full to 30 per cent capacity.A Glastonbury-style scramble is set for Monday, when the pre-booking reopens for venues open from Thursday.Full details of which areas are open will be on the National Trust website on Monday, but the places with bigger car parks are expected to open their doors first.Members will be able to book a space for free, while non-members will need to pay in advance for their space.A spokesperson for the National Trust said: Details about which car parks are bookable will appear on property webpages, and we are urging visitors to check online for the latest details and booking instructions before travelling.Our plans for the pre-booking system will help address social distancing measures when that opens as it will mean our properties will be at about 30 per cent capacity meaning people will have space to move around and adhere to social distancing guidelines.All car parks in Wales and Northern Ireland remain closed after the First Minister in Wales and the Northern Ireland Executive reiterated the \u0027stay at home\u0027 message.Because of a Government ban on ticketed venues, any gardens and houses which usually require payment to access will be closed.When this ban eases, these venues will begin to open in a gradual and safe way, the charity explained.A spokesperson said: Our plans for the pre-booking system will help address social distancing measures when that opens as it will mean our properties will be at about 30 per cent capacity meaning people will have space to move around and adhere to social distancing guidelines.Beaches and other beauty spots across England are cautiously reopening, but warning visitors not to flood venues.North Norfolk District Council (NNDC) has decided to reopen the public car parks at Pretty Corner and Holt Country Park.However, it decided not to open car parks at its popular beaches, including Sheringham, Wells and Cromer, to avoid a potential sudden influx of visitors.Sarah Bütikofer, leader of the council, said: We have also taken the decision not to open our seafront and beach public car parks at this time, although we will be monitoring and reviewing the situation daily.

Many women are likely to be particularly badly impacted by the stance of the unions. It came as Britain\u0027s infection rate rose slightly to between 0.7 and 1, and the Government suggested that lockdown restrictions could be eased at different speeds in different regions.Speaking at the Downing Street press briefing on Friday, Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said that reopening schools is an incredible challenge, adding that there is an awful lot” of preparation needed to make sure they can operate safely.  However, he added that the “good news” is that coronavirus “seems to spare children in almost every case”, adding: “The risk to children is much, much lower than to anyone else in society, to any other age group, certainly if you don’t have underlying health conditions.”  Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, has said he stands by June 1 as the earliest date that schools should begin to reopen, adding: “Getting children back to school is vital for their educational development.”Dr Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, on Friday acknowledged there is a lot of anxiety about schools reopening but urged people to keep perspective.She said that there are currently two or three cases of coronavirus in every 1000, and that in the next couple of weeks that is likely to half.“There is a lot of anxiety I think around this but people need to think through - in an average infant school with 100 children the likelihood of anyone having this is very small and diminishing with time,” Dr Harries said.  In the study commissioned by the Children\u0027s Commissioner, of 62 nurseries that are attached to NHS hospitals in England only three reported a confirmed case of Covid-19 among children and none reported transmission between children in the nursery.The survey of 39 NHS nursery managers also found that 19 had suspected or confirmed cases of Covid-19 among the staff but none said they caught it from the nursery.Ms Longfield said that allowing pupils from Reception, Year One and Year Six to return first is “sensible” since these are the year groups who need to be in school “most urgently”.“We know that the longer schools are closed the greater the impact will be on social mobility and that many children are really struggling without seeing their friends and the structure that school brings,” she said.On Friday night, the Department for Education published a summary of the scientific advice that underpinned their decision to reopen schools, which acknowledges that the “exact rates of infectivity and transmission of children is not fully known yet”.While there is a “high degree of confidence” that coronavirus is less severe in children than in adults, there is a “low degree of confidence at best” that children transmit the virus less than adults.There is also a “low” degree of confidence that children up to age 13 are less susceptible to infection than adults, the document said.Kevin Courtney, the joint General Secretary of the National Education Union (NEU), said that his views remain “unchanged” following a meeting with the Chief Medical Officer, Prof Chris Whitty, and Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir Patrick Vallance, to discuss the advice.He has instructed his 445,000 members not to “engage” with plans to begin a phased reopening of schools from June 1 since he is not convinced that it is safe for them to return.The British Medical Association has also weighed in to support the unions, saying that its views are “completely aligned” with the NEU.  Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA council chair, said: “Until we have got case numbers much lower, we should not consider reopening schools.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"summer weather could playing large role lowering coronavirus","story":"Coronavirus cases have fallen dramatically in recent weeks, particularly in London, where Public Health England (PHE) modelling suggests fewer than 24 people a day are now picking up the virus.But can all the reduction be due to lockdown measures and social distancing? Or might the onset of summer and the warmer, brighter weather, be helping to suppress the virus?Here is what we know about the effect of climate, weather, sunshine and Vitamin D on coronavirus:Latest research suggests that coronavirus is following a very specific path around the globe, leaving some countries unscathed, while having a disproportionately devastating impact elsewhere. The University of Maryland found that most cases fall along a narrow east-west corridor of 30 and 50 degrees of latitude, which includes northern Italy, the Pacific Northwest, Japan, Iran, South Korea, France, Spain and Germany. All share similar climatic conditions. In contrast, areas which were expected to be hardest hit, because of geographical proximity and travel connections to the Chinese outbreak - such as Southeast Asia - have had low infections and deaths compared to those in the ‘coronavirus belt’.Weather records in the hardest hit countries had similar average temperatures of between 5°C and 11°C and humidity of 47 to 79 per cent, which is close to laboratory conditions in which coronavirus thrives.None of the temperatures in badly affected cities dipped below 0°C during the height of the epidemic, which may suggest a threshold beyond which the virus cannot survive.The University of Oxford also recently conducted a review into whether climate conditions were playing a role in the transmission of coronavirus, and found that cold and dry conditions appear to boost spread. They found that while the global death rate was 0.2 per cent, in the northern hemisphere it was 0.3 per cent and even discovered a gradient relationship in Italy, with the south being less impacted than the north.Analysis of the previous Sars outbreak in Hong Kong has shown that the number of daily cases was higher on days where the weather was cooler and research has shown that viruses are able to live far longer on surfaces when it is cold.Warmer weather also leads to less people huddled together indoors, so the virus has less chance to jump from person to person.There is growing evidence that Vitamin D is protective against coronavirus and that people with chronically low levels may be at greater risk.Researchers from the Anglia Ruskin University compared the numbers of coronavirus cases to the average levels of vitamin D for 20 European countries and found a significant correlation.Italy and Spain have both experienced high mortality rates, and scientists found both countries have lower than average vitamin D levels.This is partly because people in southern Europe, particularly the elderly, avoid strong sun, while their darker skin pigmentation also reduces the body\u0027s ability to produce natural vitamin D.In contrast, the highest average levels of vitamin D are found in northern Europe, due to high consumption of cod liver oil and vitamin D supplements, and possibly less sun avoidance.Scandinavian nations are among the countries with the lowest number of Covid-19 cases and mortality rates per head of population in Europe.Dr Lee Smith, Reader in Physical Activity and Public Health at Anglia Ruskin University, said: “Vitamin D has been shown to protect against acute respiratory infections, and older adults, the group most deficient in vitamin D, are also the ones most seriously affected by Covid-19. “A previous study found that 75 per cent of people in institutions, such as hospitals and care homes, were severely deficient in vitamin D.”Vitamin D modulates the response of white blood cells, preventing them from releasing too many inflammatory cells which may stop the body overreacting to the virus. A study by Trinity College Dublin and University of Liverpool published this week also shows that vitamin D appears to help reduce serious complications in coronavirus patients.It has also been pointed out by experts that black and minority ethnic (BAME) iniduals living in northerly latitudes are often deficient in vitamin D which may partly explain the higher death rates in these groups. During the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, doctors noticed that patients who were nursed outdoors appeared to fare better. Sunlight is known to be germicidal and there is growing evidence that it can kill viruses as well. Viruses tend to survive better in cold weather because they have a fatty protective coating which degrades when it is warm. While the melting of the coating allows the virus to invade the warmth of the body, it dies if the casing disintegrates outside.One study by Harvard University showed at 6°C in dry weather, flu on a surface survived for more than 23 hours, but at a temperature of 32°C it was dying within an hour. And bright sunlight can quickly heat up surfaces beyond 32°C even if the outside air temperature is lower. Britain experienced the sunniest April on record which has coincided with a substantial fall in new cases. The UK had an average of 224.5 hours of sunshine last month, compared with 211.9 hours in April 2015, the previous highest.Prof Keith Neal, Emeritus Professor in the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases, University of Nottingham, said: “Sunlight includes ultraviolet radiation. This damages DNA and RNA.  “I have not seen any work on how quickly this affects Covid-19 but viruses left on surfaces outside will dry out and be damaged by UV light in sunlight.”Researcher Dr Richard Hobday, author of the Healing Sun and The Light Revolution, said that during the First World War, military surgeons routinely used sunlight to heal infected wounds.“Public health advice in the 1918 pandemic was sleep with your bedroom windows open and get out in the fresh air and sunshine. “Hospital patients who were nursed outdoors in tents and put in the sun seem to have recovered far better than those indoors.”Earlier this week, Giving evidence at the science and technology select committee, Professor Alan Penn, the chief scientific adviser at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said being outdoors will help prevent people from contracting the virus.“The science suggests that being outside in sunlight, with good ventilation, are both highly protective against transmission of the virus.”Open-air therapy was once a popular treatment for deadly respiratory conditions such as tuberculosis, and patients were regularly put outside to breathe the fresh air until antibiotics became standard in the 1950s.As early as the 1960s, the Ministry of Defence had shown that outdoor air is a natural disinfectant, able to kill the flu virus and other harmful germs.Hospital wards were once ‘cross-ventilated’ with large windows to allow fresh air to move freely, but modern hospitals mostly have closed systems and depend on air conditioning for their air supply.In March, scientists from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases in Singapore found that coronavirus could spread around buildings via air conditioning systems or even on a draught, after discovering traces of the virus in a hospital air duct.Prof Neal said that fresh air quickly dispersed any droplets of coronavirus that are in the atmosphere.“Talking and coughing can produce droplets and aerosols. Droplets, which are larger than aerosols, carry more virus but fall rapidly to the ground under gravity. “Aerosols are smaller and can drift further but also dry out quickly because they lose water content as they have a high surface area to volume unlike droplets. They are also rapidly dispersed with air movements and we rarely have no air movements outside.“I intend to avail myself of the new recommendations and go fishing and play golf.  The risk is miniscule and I think I am more likely to be killed by lightning.”Dr Hobday added: “It\u0027s far easier to catch a respiratory infection indoors than outside - especially if ventilation rates are low. “And forcing people to stay indoors has prevented them getting out in the sun and building up their vitamin D levels after a long winter.” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tiger king mexico lassos big cat surburban street","story":"A cowboy has been hailed the Tiger King of Mexico after lassoing a big cat that was running wild on a suburban street.Extraordinary video filmed by motorists showed the tiger roaming along a pavement next to a chain-link.Three men approached it, one carrying a fold up chair to defend himself.But he stood aside as another man in a cowboy hat, denim jeans and polka-dot shirt, casually jogged up.The man, who has not been named, expertly twirled a rope over his head, and lassoed the tiger around the neck at the first attempt.Motorists filming from feet away in Jalisco, Guadalajara, gasped as the cowboy dug his heels in and was pulled along by the tiger.A video posted on Facebook has been watched more than one million timesOne woman on the video can be heard exclaiming in Spanish: It’s a tiger!

That’s more than twice as bad as the ADB forecast in April.However, government measures to mitigate the economic impact could reduce that figure by as much as 40 per cent, ADB’s chief economist Yasuyuki Sawada said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAs some countries, including the UK, lay out plans to ease lockdowns and get more people back to work, Mr Sawada cautioned that containing the pandemic is key to reducing the economic cost. Testing, tracing, isolation, effective social distancing, and securing protective and medical equipment are all “essential elements” of containing Covid-19, he said. Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?He also pointed to the importance of government support for struggling families and businesses to lessen the adverse effects of the pandemic and to avoid long-term consequences for growth and development.“Rapid and effective containment will allow for a faster recovery,” he said. “Then, it is critical to identify industries and occupations in terms of essentiality and economic importance, and their ability to operate safely with adequate social distancing.“Finally, governments should reopen the economy sequentially, balancing health risks and economic considerations, and being ready to tighten if outbreaks reoccur. For all of this, having adequate data and information is key.”His words came as the UK government faced criticism from scientists over its easing of lockdown restrictions this week.The Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) warned on Tuesday that the UK faces “inevitable” future lockdowns if the government implements its “potentially dangerous” coronavirus strategy.Ministers laid out plans this week to get sectors including construction and manufacturing back to work, and to restart the housing market.However, the government was accused of confusing people with it’s new message to “stay alert”, replacing a previous instruction to “stay at home”.The number of deaths in the UK has fallen in recent days but the Independent Sage, an alternative to the government’s official scientific advisory panel, said numbers of infections were still too high to implement an effective policy of tracking, tracing and isolating cases.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

More than 40 per cent of those surveyed said sale prices could drop by more than 4 per cent this year.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPredictions on house prices vary wildly thanks to huge uncertainty about the economic impact of the virus. A forecast by the Centre for Economics and Business Research was more gloomy, pointing to an estimated 13 per cent drop in average house prices.It came as the government announced plans this week to reopen the housing market, which has ground to a halt during the pandemic thanks to a ban on almost all home moves. That meant around £82bn of sales had stalled, according to property website Zoopla.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Other measures aimed at helping homeowners attracted criticism on Thursday as it emerged that taking a payment holiday on mortgages or other forms of debt could affect someone’s ability to borrow money in future.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) told lenders to help people struggling financially during the pandemic by temporarily halting payments on credit cards, personal loans and mortgages for up to three months.Borrowers had been told this would not affect their credit score, but MoneySavingExpert highlighted on Thursday that some lenders take other factors into account when deciding whether to grant borrowing.Interest still builds up during a payment holiday, leaving borrowers with a larger bill to pay afterwards.The number of mortgages in arrears increased slightly in the first three months of the year, figures from trade body UK Finance showed.Some 72,380 homeowner mortgages were behind by more than 2.5 per cent of the outstanding balance, compared to 70,880 in the fourth quarter of 2019, figures from UK Finance show.That number is expected to rise in the second quarter as households begin to feel the impact of Covid-19 on their finances.The FCA announced on Thursday that insurance customers will be able to request payment holidays from next week. Some may also be able to move onto a cheaper deal or get a partial refund of the cost of their policy.The measures will come into force on Monday 18 May and be reviewed in the next three months. Customers’ risk profiles may have changed because of coronavirus and there may be scope to offer customers lower premiums, the FCA said.​No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Losses could widen further if lockdown measures are extended into the next quarter, making the bill for Covid-19 bigger than the 911 terrorist attacks and all the devastating Caribbean hurricanes of 2017 combined, Lloyd’s warned on Thursday.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt said that Covid-19 was “vastly different” to natural disasters that have previously racked up big losses for insurers. Those events were geographically contained whereas the pandemic is global, systemic and will have a longer-term impact.“Lloyd’s believes that once the scale and complexity of the social and economic impact of Covid-19 is fully understood, the overall cost to the global insurance non-life industry is likely to be far in excess of those historical events,” the insurance market said.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Some $28bn is expected to be paid in 2020 across a wide range of policies, including event cancellation, property and travel. Further payouts are expected as the effects of Covid-19 continue to unfold, on policies such as professional indemnity and credit insurance.Lloyd’s chief executive John Neal said: “The global insurance industry is paying out on a very wide range of policies to support businesses and people affected by Covid-19. The Lloyd’s market alone is currently expected to pay claims amounting to some $4.3bn, making it one of the market’s largest payouts ever.“What makes Covid-19 unique is not just the devastating continuing human and social impact, but also the economic shock.“Taking all those factors together will challenge the industry as never before, but we will keep focused on supporting our customers and continuing to pay claims over the weeks and months ahead.”Llloyd’s paid out $4.8bn in 2017 as three of the most damaging hurricanes in history destroyed parts of the Caribbean. After 911 it paid out $4.7bn.Lloyd’s said that its estimates for 2020 assume that social distancing and some form of lockdown continue to the end of the year.

Losses could widen further if lockdown measures are extended into the next quarter, making the bill for Covid-19 bigger than the 911 terrorist attacks and all the devastating Caribbean hurricanes of 2017 combined, Lloyd’s warned on Thursday.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt said that Covid-19 was “vastly different” to natural disasters that have previously racked up big losses for insurers. Those events were geographically contained whereas the pandemic is global, systemic and will have a longer-term impact.“Lloyd’s believes that once the scale and complexity of the social and economic impact of Covid-19 is fully understood, the overall cost to the global insurance non-life industry is likely to be far in excess of those historical events,” the insurance market said.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Some $28bn is expected to be paid in 2020 across a wide range of policies, including event cancellation, property and travel. Further payouts are expected as the effects of Covid-19 continue to unfold, on policies such as professional indemnity and credit insurance.Lloyd’s chief executive John Neal said: “The global insurance industry is paying out on a very wide range of policies to support businesses and people affected by Covid-19. The Lloyd’s market alone is currently expected to pay claims amounting to some $4.3bn, making it one of the market’s largest payouts ever.“What makes Covid-19 unique is not just the devastating continuing human and social impact, but also the economic shock.“Taking all those factors together will challenge the industry as never before, but we will keep focused on supporting our customers and continuing to pay claims over the weeks and months ahead.”Llloyd’s paid out $4.8bn in 2017 as three of the most damaging hurricanes in history destroyed parts of the Caribbean. After 911 it paid out $4.7bn.Lloyd’s said that its estimates for 2020 assume that social distancing and some form of lockdown continue to the end of the year.

We need urgent clarity on the causes of this breach and what impact it might have on ongoing research into the coronavirus and potential therapies”.Live - Covid-19 could be wiped out in London \u0027within weeks\u0027Archer is hosted by the University of Edinburgh one of the UK\u0027s most powerful supercomputers, and is in the top 500 supercomputers in the world. It was intended to be replaced earlier this year, but that move has been delayed as it is used by for important research on the pandemic.In a statement, those on the team fixing the supercomputer suggested that Archer may have been hit along with other supercomputers in the UK and elsewhere.We now believe this to be a major issue across the academic community as several computers have been compromised in the UK and elsewhere in Europe, the team wrote in an update on the Archer status page.The National Cyber Security Centre is also helping to understand the attack and how it could be fixed, the update indicated.Service is expected to be restored next week but could be delayed even more if there are further problems with the investigation.Created with Sketch.Coronavirus: London on lockdown Show all 29Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man walks down a deserted Camden High StreetGoodge Street Station is one of the many stations closed to help reduce the spreadAn empty street in the heart of ChinatownPeople in masks in Chinatown a day after the lockdownA near-empty Piccadilly Circus during the first week of lockdownSonja, my neighbour, who I photographed while taking a short walk.

Schools have been told to start planning for some pupils ⁠– including those in early year settings, reception and year 1 ⁠– to return on 1 June, and for all primary school students to be back in school before the summer holidays.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?The targets have been criticised by some education unions, which have aired concerns for pupil and staff safety during the coronavirus pandemic.This week, a group of nine unions called for the government to “step back” from its 1 June goal and said it was too early for any assurances that it was safe for children to return.Separately, the National Union for Head Teachers (NAHT) told members there was no point planning for all primary students to return before summer, as this was not “realistic”.On Friday, it emerged schools in Liverpool would not be opening up to more students on 1 June ⁠– the government’s target for the first pupils to start coming back.  The mayor said earlier this week said he was “minded to resist” the prime minister’s suggested partial reopening date because of safeguarding concerns.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailAfter union leaders met with officials on Friday, the head of education at Unison said the meetings were “useful” but “questions remain around the capacity for schools to be able to fully test, trace and isolate children and school staff”. “Many support staff come from backgrounds that put them at greater risk if they’re infected with Covid-19,” Jon Richards said. “Workers including teaching assistants, cleaners and school meals staff mustn’t be put in danger just because the government is in a hurry to get schools running again.”Dr Roach from the NASUWT teachers’ union said: “No information was provided to change the widely held view that the evidence base for opening schools from 1 June is weak. No evidence was provided at the meeting and there was no clarity about when it will be provided by Sage.“No confirmation was provided that teachers are at low risk of catching the virus following the wider opening of schools.”Dr Roach said the union “remains clear that no school should reopen until it can demonstrate that it is safe to do so”.The NEU’s joint general secretary, Kevin Courtney, said he was told in Friday’s meeting about the reopening of schools “there is still a lot of uncertainty about the science”.On Friday afternoon, the education ministry published an overview on the scientific evidence guiding its response to coronavirus following calls for greater transparency. “The exact rates of infectivity and transmission of children are not fully known yet this is a novel virus and the scientific understanding is developing all the time,” the document read.In a question and answer session on Mumsnet on Friday, the minister for children and families said the potential reopening of schools to some pupils on 1 June depends on what the scientific advice is at the time.“We are asking schools, colleges and childcare providers to plan on this basis, ahead of confirmation that these tests are met,” Vicky Ford said.​Some headteachers have expressed concerns over whether social distancing can be done properly in schools when they reopen, particularly with young children.“I think what the government have is a glaring lack of understanding about how nursery and reception children behave,” Darren Morgan, the school leader at Kings Road Primary School in Manchester, told The Independent.“They just cannot be socially distanced. We can put all the measures in place in the world.”A headteacher from the St George’s Church of England Primary School in Kent wrote to parents this week saying: “I am not going to sit here and write to you to say we can achieve social distancing in a school”.Howard Fisher said: “What is missing from this discussion is a sensible, rational debate around better solutions, such as repeating a year and coming back when we have more science to support us. Believe me, I would rather any child repeats a year than go back too soon and have to lose a child.”Headteachers’ union says schools cannot fulfill plan to reopen Government has little evidence children less likely to spread virusThe government published advice for how primary schools can work to reopen this week, recommending wearing PPE when dealing with a child with Covid-19 symptoms and not using rota systems.The headteacher of Quarry Bank Primary School in Dudley told The Independent: “Teachers are worried that in any other situation, where socially distancing can’t be observed, then people are encouraged to wear PPE ⁠– but not in schools.”Alex Rawlings said: “We’ve been advised to use PPE when managing children with symptoms, but you’d be very hard pressed to find a school that has eye protection, for example.”However, some schools have already committed to reopening next month ⁠– if the government goes ahead with its plans.They have been looking at introducing one-way systems, half days and staggered lunches in a bid to keep young children apart.Labour MP not happy that it is safe to send her child back to schoolSteve Chalke, founder of the Oasis Trust ⁠– an academy trust with 35 primary schools across the country ⁠– has said that it is “common sense” for pupils to return to school, especially for children from lower-income families who see it as a place of “security and safety”.Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said on Friday: “Getting children back to school is vital for their educational development and many schools are already taking steps to welcome back their pupils. I am grateful for their support.“I want to reassure parents and families that we are giving schools, nurseries and other providers all the guidance and support they will need to welcome more children back in a phased way and no earlier than 1 June.Mr Williamson added: “That’s why we have engaged closely with stakeholders from across the sector throughout the past seven weeks, including the trade unions, and today we arranged a detailed briefing for them with the scientific and medical experts.”Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The comments came after a CNBC report that said multiple anonymous AI researchers said they saw Musk’s views on the technology as inappropriate.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAn AI executive speaking to CNBC, who asked to remain anonymous because their company may work for one of Musk’s businesses, said that “A large proportion of the community think he’s a negative distraction.”He is sensationalist, he veers wildly between openly worrying about the downside risk of the technology and then hyping the AGI (artificial general intelligence) agenda. Whilst his very real accomplishments are acknowledged, his loose remarks lead to the general public having an unrealistic understanding of the state of AI maturity.”It’s time to draw the curtain on celebrity businessmen like Musk“AGI” stands for “artificial general intelligence,” which is the hypothetical benchmark whereby a machine can learn anything that a human being could. This is distinct from \u0027standard\u0027 artificial intelligence, which is when a machine is capable of carrying out a task like a human could, such as voice recognition in Siri or Alexa.Another specialised focused on speech recognition said that Musk is “not always looked upon favourably,” while an AI researcher at a UK university said that they “instinctively fall on dislike, because he makes up such nonsense.”“But then he delivers such extraordinary things. It always leaves me wondering, does he know what he’s doing? Is all the visionary stuff just a trick to get an innovative thing to market?” they continued.On Twitter, Pesenti said that many people in the AI community would be happy to criticise Musk publicly, stating that Musk “has no idea what he is talking about when he talks about AI. There is no such thing as AGI and we are nowhere near matching human intelligence.”While Facebook team declined to give an official comment, Pesenti said that it was his “personal opinion” but that others at the company – including Yann LeCun, a professor at New York University and a Chief AI Scientist at Facebook and Edward Grefenstette, a Facebook AI Research Scientist – agreed.LeCun quote-tweeted Musk’s disparaging comment, saying that Tesla’s engineers still needed access to Facebook’s PyTorch to develop their products. PyTorch is a free, open source machine learning library primarily developed by Facebok’s AI Research lab.The researchers, Tesla, and SpaceX were contacted by The Independent for comment.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMining requires vast amounts of processing power and therefore malicious iniduals have placed the code in adverts in order to use the devices viewing the ads – sometimes without the knowledge of the person whose device it is.“We have recently discovered that a fraction of a percent of ads consume a disproportionate share of device resources, such as battery and network data, without the user knowing about it” Google said in a blog post. Google Meet goes free as fight for group chats continue“In order to save our users’ batteries and data plans, and provide them with a good experience on the web, Chrome will limit the resources a display ad can use before the user interacts with the ad. When an ad reaches its limit, the ad\u0027s frame will navigate to an error page, informing the user that the ad has used too many resources.”In targetting these adverts, Google found the ones that use more CPU or network bandwidth than 99.9 per cent of all adverts – meaning it should only be the most extreme ads that are hit by the new change.The experiment is coming over the next few months, the search giant says, in order to give advertisers and tool providers time to adjust to the changes and limitations. The plan is that a stable version of this technology will come to Chrome in August.This is not the only update that Google has recently made to its Chrome browser.

The accords are named in keeping with the Artemis programme, which is the plan to send the first woman and next man to the moon by 2024.They would include a commitment to be transparent in their work, to only explore space for “peaceful purposes”, and to guarantee they would work together to save any astronauts that came into danger during a mission.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNasa was explicit that the agreements would be made in keeping with the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which currently sets the legal framework for space exploration. That requires a set of commitments from countries which are intended to ensure that space missions are as safe and transparent as possible.But the new Artemis Accords go further than those commitments, requiring more detailed principles from the countries prepared to work with the US to head to the moon and beyond.Nasa reveals Tesla car that will drive astronauts to new launch“While Nasa is leading the Artemis programme, international partnerships will play a key role in achieving a sustainable and robust presence on the moon while preparing to conduct a historic human mission to Mars,” the agency said on its website.“With numerous countries and private sector players conducting missions and operations in cislunar space, it’s critical to establish a common set of principles to govern the civil exploration and use of outer space.”In full, the principles are that any mission should be conducted with peaceful purposes should be transparent and use technology that is interoperable and conforms to open, international standards that everyone can use. International partners also have to agree to provide emergency assistance to astronauts in trouble publicly register any space objects release the scientific data they gather protect the heritage of historic space artefacts gather resources according to international agreements not harmfully interfere with other missions and dispose of any debris or spacecraft responsibly.When drafts of the accords were leaked earlier this month, they attracted ire from Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Russia’s space agency Roscosmos. He suggested on Twitter that the US was planning to invade the moon like it had Iraq and Afghanistan, and that the accords would be a way of building a coalition of other countries that would allow for it to take over the lunar surface.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Representatives also indicated that they hope for Russia to sign a version of the accords.As well as drawing criticism from Russia, the accords appear to be something of a rebuke to the Chinese space programme, which has traditionally been less transparent than the US. Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine explicitly referenced the problems around its recent rocket launch as an example of where the accords could help.“The empty core stage of the Long March 5B, weighing nearly 20 tons, was in an uncontrolled free fall along a path that carried it over Los Angeles and other densely populated areas,” Mr Bridenstine told Ars Technica.“I can think of no better example of why we need the Artemis Accords. It’s vital for the US to lead and establish norms of behaviour against such irresponsible activities. Space exploration should inspire hope and wonder, not fear and danger.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The board is made up of a number of Twitch streamers including CohhCarnage, Cupahnoodle, FerociouslySteph, and Zizaran, who collectively have an audience of approximately 1.6M followers.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt also includes the deputy CEO of the non-profit ‘The Diana Award’ Alex Holmes, which aims to help prevent bullying in schools, and Emma Llansó Director of the Center for Democracy \u0026amp Technology’s Free Expression Project which supports “Internet users’ free expression rights” and has worked on counter-terrorism, disinformation, and radicalising content.Finally, the board includes two academics: Dr. Sameer Hinduja, a Professor in the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Florida Atlantic University and Co-Director of the Cyberbullying Research Center, and T.L. Taylor, a Professor of Comparative Media Studies at MIT and co-founder and Director of Research for eSports organisation AnyKey.The meteoric rise of TwitchAs a platform Twitch has struggled with its own terms of service. It has been inconsistent with streamers it has or has not banned, among claims that there is a “level of inconsistency coming from the platform and favouritism”. Zizaran, in the press release, says he “looks forward to helping Twitch make rules clearer and reducing community confusion, specifically when it comes to bans and suspensions on the platform.” Twitch has also come under criticism for controversial streams the company has platformed this includes a streamer who assaulted his pregnant partner during a stream, a streamer suspended after accidentally shooting a gun at his computer during a live stream, and a 35-minute mass murder video that was shared on the platform.Twitch faces competition from Google-owned YouTube Gaming and Microsoft-owned Mixer, which last year got world-famous livestreamer Ninja (Tyler Bevins) to leave Amazon’s platform for their own.Since Ninja left, his Twitch channel was used to promote adult content, with CEO Emmett Sheer having to issue an apology.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

It’s just horrible to think of it in this day and age. I’ve had help from some brilliant volunteers too. I’ve got three young girls at home and I hope they’re learning something about giving back to the community from all this.“I think The Felix Project is doing fantastic work right now. Stopping food going to waste is such a brilliant thing.”Tim Young decided last month to start volunteering with Bread n Butter: a social enterprise in Barnet getting up to 600 cooked meals and food parcels out each day, thanks to around 80 crates of produce supplied weekly by The Felix Project.The 55-year-old – who is still recovering from a heart operation he had earlier this year – has been cooking up to 150 meals a week from his own kitchen.“I’m relatively lucky, I’ve got quite a big kitchen and lots of pots and pans – so I wanted to do what I could. It’s hard to see how much people are struggling at the moment, because the level of need seems to be going up and up. But it’s a pretty good feeling being able to help others out.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I’m so glad it isn’t going to waste. It’s going to the people who need it most.”The Felix Project has quadrupled its deliveries since the beginning of the lockdown to 40 tons a day, and supplies more than 100 charities, school groups, hostels and community hubs across London.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups across the UK that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There was an 81 per cent increase in emergency food parcels given out during the last two weeks of March compared to the same period in 2019.Warning that the enormous level of need was likely to continue, she said: “If would be false of me to say we can continue to meet indefinitely an unspecified level of increased demand.”How to support our campaignThe Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign is seeking to raise £10m for the food surplus charity The Felix Project so it can provide food for NHS staff, the poor and elderly who are unable to afford supplies or remain stuck at home for health reasons.The Trussell Trust chief said food aid charities had done “incredible work” since the beginning of the outbreak, and said more than 50 per cent of food banks had adapted to the lockdown by doing home deliveries.However, Ms Revie argued that unless the government strengthened the financial safety net, the UK would continue to see “the kind of destitution that drives people to food banks”.She added: “The problem is people falling into financial hardship. The answer to financial hardship is not food. We are treating one symptom of an underlying problem … The issue we must be focusing on reducing the flow of people into foodbanks.”Advocating a “cash-first approach”, Ms Revie said: “If we’re identifying families in financial hardship ⁠– the most straightforward and dignified response is to provide them with the cash.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The red zone will not be “very different to lockdown but it will be a cautious first step”, the first minister told Sky News on Friday, as he explained the exit plan will not be given a time frame for when the country could expect to see any changes.Under lockdown, schools will remain closed except for vulnerable children and children of key workers, and members of the public are to work from home if possible and not to leave their homes except for essentials.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?When Wales moves into the red zone, local travel will be allowed, including for click-and-collect retail, and people will be allowed to provide or receive care and support to or from one family member or friend outside of their own household.The amber zone involves “priority groups of pupils” being allowed to return to school in stages, and people can travel for leisure with small groups of family or friends for exercise. Non-essential retail and services will be allowed to resume, and the government aims to get more people travelling to work by this stage.The final green zone will allow all children and students to go back to school and access education. Unrestricted travel will be allowed, but will be subject to ongoing precautions, and all sports, leisure and cultural activities with friends will be permitted as long as people undertake physical distancing.However, decisions on moving the country into the different phases of the roadmap “will need to be made on prioritisation”. “It is quite possible that Wales will be on ‘red’ for one type of activities, ‘amber’ for another and still in lockdown for a third,” said the government release.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailMr Drakeford said: “Over the last eight weeks, we have seen an incredible effort, from all parts of our society, to respond to the unprecedented challenge to our way of life posed by the Covid-19 virus.“As a result, we, like countries across the world, are able to think about how we can move out of lockdown. But it is essential that we recognise this is not a short-term crisis. Until there is a vaccine or effective treatment, we will have to live with the disease in our society and to try to control its spread and mitigate its effects.“The challenges we face are shared with all parts of the United Kingdom. For that reason, we have always supported a four-nation approach to the lifting of the lockdown.“But this has to respect the responsibilities of each government to determine the speed at which it is safe to move and the balance to be struck between different forms of ‘easement’ ⁠– how to prioritise between allowing people to meet up with close family, to go shopping or to the hairdresser, to get back to work or visit the seaside,” he added.The Welsh government’s roadmap comes as Boris Johnson’s official spokesman confirmed some elements of the lockdown could be eased at different rates in different parts of the UK.The Recovery Strategy document, which was released by the government on Monday, states the authorities would be responsive to emerging data on local infection rates when implementing the exit plan.Mr Johnson’s spokesman said: “It could lead to some of the measures being eased at different rates in different parts of the country. At the same time, it could lead to some measures being re-imposed in some parts of the country and not in others.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I was having a Zoom drink with a friend and it got to a stage where I was so exhausted. I thought maybe I was just a bit hungover or was in a weird mood but then it continued and I felt exhausted the next night on another Zoom call.”How to support our campaignHer condition deteriorated rapidly. “I was having to consciously remember to breathe,” she added. “My lungs hurt. It was really scary. I was an alien for a while, I could barely speak. I wasn’t sure if I would make it.”Ms Khan rang 111, who told her to wait it out at home and see if she got worse. But within days, she said she couldn’t even walk. “I felt weak and dizzy. I couldn’t move at all, I was just on the sofa, trying to remember to breathe. I thought I might be having a heart attack or a stroke. My left side felt numb.”A friend called 999 on her behalf and medics came to her home. Ms Khan said: “They checked my vitals and they were happy enough with me. My oxygen levels were OK\u0026nbspand they said it might be that I was fatigued.“They said sometimes people get another blow when they are almost over the virus and that is what probably happened to me. It felt like an exorcism.” At the peak of her illness, Ms Khan went online to seek help. The artist, whose mother is in her seventies and is isolating so could not provide support, found out about Help The Hungry via Facebook, where she was connected with Made In Hackney.For the past three weeks, the musician\u0026nbsphas been receiving daily meals via the organisation. The service has made her life “so much easier”, she said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I have a daily meal, like tofu curry. I can’t cook at the moment, I am not strong enough, especially with my arthritis my body is just not in a good way. I am still exhausted. It has been a real lifeline to know I will be fed once a day.”Ms Khan is slowly on the mend but says her previous conditions have worsened.

We couldn’t be prouder to donate and help them to get food to people in the most difficult situations.”Another supplier to go the extra mile is Reach Food Service, a provider of premium ingredients to London’s gourmet restaurants, which has donated £10,000.In addition it has pledged £1 for every home delivery during 2020 of its newly launched Reach My Kitchen initiative – dispensing meat, seafood and poultry ingredients normally reserved for London’s top chefs directly to households – and which it estimates will raise its total donation to £50,000.Other food-linked organisations that have already supported our appeal include The Daylesford Foundation, which donated £100,000, and Hello Fresh with £25,000.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Richard Smith, supply manager of The Felix Project, said they had “really stepped up to the plate”.How to support our campaign“Some companies have hugely increased their supplies to us,” he said. “Innocent normally give us five pallets a week but this week we took 24 pallets off them. Same with Müller – their contribution has quadrupled.”Evgeny Lebedev, a shareholder in The Independent, said: “Our Food for London Now campaign has raised £4m in just seven weeks. With more than 1,500 reader donations, and the support of London companies, we have reached heights few expected.“We have told the stories of the people who are suffering during this pandemic. The homeless, the unemployed, the isolated. And we have saluted the innovative people who have applied their skills to helping them in this crisis.“The capital has heard our call, but the hunger crisis has not peaked – just look at the grim economic news from this week. We have committed to raising £10m to ensure the food security of Londoners for three years. So well done, but the hard part comes now. ”Here, 11 of Felix’s most prolific suppliers (in addition to Ocado) explain why they have chosen to partner with Felix, London’s biggest food surplus distributor.Felix suppliers and their generous food donations in April:The firm which produces online recipe boxes has donated 39 tons. Laurent Guillemain, its CEO, said: “We are proud to partner with Felix during the most extraordinary of times. Helping to care for our communities and the vulnerable is more important than ever and we will continue to support this incredible initiative that helps redistribute surplus food however we can.”A dairy products company which contributed 17 tons. The managing director of Müller Yogurt and Desserts, Bergen Merey, said: “Over three years ago I committed to this genuine cause, having read the story of young Felix. With a 14-year-old son of my own, I felt inspired by this wonderful initiative in his memory.”The restaurant and hotel supplier gave 12 tons. Murtaza Lakhani, its owner, said: “The twin issues of food waste and hunger are having major impacts on London. We are proud to make a commitment to Felix as well as to supply high quality food stocks and fresh ingredients so that vulnerable families, elderly people and our amazing NHS workers know there is a nutritious meal waiting for them at the end of the day.”The company which produces smoothies has donated 11 tons. Its head of refreshment marketing, Suraj Gangani, said: “We’re proud to have supported Felix in getting our healthy drinks to those who’ve needed them through this tough time.”The craft organic bakery gave 10 tons. Its spokesperson said: “We decided to change the way we approached food waste and engage with just one organisation, The Felix Project. They are an inspiration. We appreciate that the work of Felix will become more critical and widespread now and for the foreseeable future.”A meat supply company that gave 9 tons. Tim Woodward, CEO, said: “We are delighted to work closely with Felix. Since we started working with them we have delivered over 32,000 meals and 6,200kg of meat for cooking.”The company behind restaurants including The Ivy, Le Caprice, Scott’s and Sexy Fish contributed 8 tons. Richard Caring, its founder, said: “During these difficult times we must come together.

They seem to react much better to Caravaggio than Monet. And these are Peruvian penguins, so we were speaking a bit in Spanish, and they really appreciated art history.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

across Belgium. A platform carries families to their relatives\u0027 windows. A daughter or grandson waves, and worries vanish from faces creased by age.Eve Putseys did not quite know what to expect as she was lifted up to see her 88-year-old aunt, Suzanne, at the La Cambre care home on the outskirts of Brussels.“It\u0027s been seven long weeks since I haven\u0027t been able to see her,” she said. “It\u0027s all quite emotional.”Afterward, Ms Putseys was all smiles.“I got to see her - and that was great,” she said. And on top of that “she looked very happy to see me”.The anxiety of families with relatives in nursing homes is well placed of the 8,843 confirmed and suspected cases who had died of the virus in Belgium as of Tuesday, 4,538 were in such facilities.

But in the meantime, they have been put to good use.“Yes, OK, it costs money, the operators cost money but the machines are all used,” Mr Van den Bosch said.

There will be bumps in the road and we have to keep our guard up,” the Irish prime minister said on Friday.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“If all goes well, we will enter a new phase of reopening our country every three weeks.”From Monday, small groups of up to four people will be allowed to meet outside, so long as they keep two metres apart, and people who are involved in mainly outdoor work, such as those in construction and gardening, will be allowed to return to their jobs.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Garden centres, hardware stores, farmers’ markets, opticians and mechanics will also be able to reopen.Mr Varadkar said the decision to move to phase one of the five-stage plan came following advice from the National Public Health and Emergency Team (NPHET), a group of scientific experts who have been advising the Irish government on Covid-19.The next review will take place on 5 June, but the Irish PM warned that the public would have to continue following government guidelines in order to move to the next stage.“Everything is provisional and reversible, and our progress depends on us all continuing to do what we have been doing,” he said.“As the restrictions ease and we come into contact with more people, the opportunity for the virus to spread increases.“So, self-discipline and personal responsibility will become more important, not less.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Andwe are to avoid bankruptcies, whopping tax rises and mass unemployment, the country mustto work ASAP.The conditional plan Boris Johnson laid out last night for eventually reopening society delicately balances these two facts. And The Sun cautiously welcomes it.Now, the Prime Minister must get the leaders of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales  per cent on side.We know that’s easier said than done: Nicola Sturgeon thrives on creating trouble.But she must be told that the public won’t forgive politiciansthey fail to work together while the nation is under siege.And we stand the best chance of defeating this devilish enemywe act as a United Kingdom.The PM must also urgently clear up some questions around the new rules.Does “limit contact with other people” mean we can have contact with others as long as we keep it limited  If so, what’s the limit  And which other people What exactly does “drive to other destinations mean ” Are we now allowed on cross-country jaunts to the coast  Or just five miles down the road And how on earth are parents working in industries such as manufacturing and construction supposed to go back to work while their kids are stuck at home We accept that we’re being asked to use some level of common sense. But clarity is a crucial weapon in this particular war. And woolly guidance which is wide open to abuse really could cost lives.Last night, the Prime Minister proved once again that he’s an excellent speaker.But our economy is slowly suffocating. And rhetoric won’t save it.THE prospect of the Queen withdrawing from public le for the foreseeable future will come as a real blow to Brits.Our fabulous monarch has a knack for perfectly capturing the mood of the nation — and she is the constant we all need in this unpredictable new world.That said, it comes as a relief to us that she and her advisers are taking social distancing seriously.Her Majesty is  years old, and the most important thing is that she stays safe and well.One day, she’ll meet us again.And in the meantime, her wise and wonderful TV addresses will serve as a great comfort to us all.

The Government cannot afford to repeat such a shambles.“Stay home, save lives” was a simple and effective message. The next steps are far more nuanced.They did not need another vague Churchillian rallying call. That merely sowed confusion, even among the PM’s deputy Dominic Raab and the staunchest Tories, and exposed Boris to a tsunami of snark on TV and social media.It needed instead the level of detail we eventually saw in the Government’s guidance released yesterday afternoon — and then in Boris’s Commons QA.Supporters claimed the PM’s new “stay alert” message was merely common sense any fool could grasp. That misses the point. We are being asked to live in highly unusual and restrictive ways. One person’s common sense is another’s idea of dangerous risk.Our circumstances are all dferent and specics are important — especially when police are to hand out increased fines for transgressions.But while the Government’s recent messaging has been poor, we at least now have our first welcome, albeit ­tentative, steps out of this nightmare:Outside exercise without limit, including the freedom to drive for a day out. The first chance in weeks to see a friend. All assuming social distancing.More solid guidance on masks. Precious little relief on schools, but the glimmer of some sport. Some, many Sun readers included, are being told toto work, though they may justiably fear it is unsafe.Their jobs also make them some of those most likely to die from Covid-.Their firms, factories and sites must bust a gut to ensure their safety, take every precaution and heed reasonable concerns. The grim reality, though, is that our economy must get moving again.It is typical of the infantile Left to complain that profits are being put before people. The Government is not a bottomless well of money. That’s why Rishi Sunak is limbering up to cut the sums paid to furloughed staff. He has to.Only a healthy economy and the taxes it generates can keep public services afloat, the NHS especially.Bankrupt Britain with an endless lockdown and you wreck those too. And far more lives are then lost.DONALD Trump is now harbouring an international fugitive.His case for refusing Britain’s request to extradite Harry Dunn’s alleged killer Anne Sacoolas is blown apart.The Interpol Red Notice, ordering her arrest outside the US, shows the “diplomatic immunity” under which she left the UK after the death crash was bogus.Even the US public want her to face the music. They recognise injustice when they see it.Trump must put Sacoolas on a plane.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All you need is a TV and the inclination.But while many will have used this virtual house arrest to shake off some unhealthy old habits , the reaction to Adele’s weight loss suggests that, for some, her transformation is a betrayal of everything fat activists hold dear.Of the , largely positive comments about the star losing an incredible seven stone, some sniped that she looked “unhealthy”and questioned how she lost it — the inference being that she had succumbed to having a gastric band.But as Pete Geracimo, her former personal trainer, points out: “It was never about getting super-skinny. It was about getting her healthy.”Not least, one suspects, for the benefit of her seven-year-old son Angelo. He adds: “She embraced better eating habits and committed to her fitness and ‘is sweating!’ I could not be prouder or happier for her.”Hear hear. Yet alarmingly, research out earlier this year found that millions of women hid their efforts to slim for fear of being mocked or labelled “anti-feminist”.Saints preserve us. The truth, of course, is thatsomeone is deeply insecure about their own weight, they either pooh-pooh or, worse, lash out at the efforts of those who manage to transform their lestyle via willpower and hard slog.Far easier to do that than take a look at our own bad habits and attempt to change them. True, there are plenty of people who look overweight but are physically fit.And there are plenty of skinny malinkies who can’t run for a bus without needing oxygen. At the end of the day, being happy within yourself is not about how you look, but how you feel.Andyou feel that you are unfit thanks to lousy eating habits and lack of exercise, then you should be able to do something about it without being taken to task by those who don’t have the same self-discipline.Particularly as last week’s research from the University of Liverpool found that obesity increased the risk of dying from coronavirus by  per cent. You can’t argue with that.BOREDOM at Moore Towers has reached such a crisis point that, on Sunday, I linked my iPhone to our portable speaker, put the songs on Shuffle and said we had to endure enjoy whatever track came up.At first there were plenty of goodies from Floyd, Bowie, Prefab Sprout and Talk Talk, but then Twinkle Twinkle Little Star popped up, followed by You Spin Me Round by . . . Alvin And The Chipmunks.For the record, our youngest is now . It seems it’s not just the kitchen cupboards that need a clear-out.BRINGING million people out of lockdown was never going to be easy.But Boris’s much-trumpeted grand statement was a damp squib that’s left us as confused as Adam and Eve on Mother’s Day.In a nutshell, four-year-olds will be able go to school with lots of kids they’re not related to but not see other kids in their family, we can go to work with colleagues but not have a chat with them in their garden, we can do unlimited exercise which we could have done anyway,we go abroad we have to self-isolate for a fortnight . . . unless it’s France, and you can drive to other destinations but not too far, whatever that means.As for “stay alert”, is that the same as Police  presenter Shaw Taylor’s old mantra of: “Keep ’em peeled ”Except we could actually see someone coming at us with a crowbar.A virus that can fit squillion times on to the head of a pin might prove harder to spot.GIVEN that the use of face masks is being actively encouraged but not the professional ones needed by key workers, a number of DIY versions are being suggested.Some involve an element of seamstress skills, but for those who want a quick and effective mask they can drum up with the minimum effort, this is my favourite.Loop a child’s hair tieover each end until it resembles a boiled sweet, then fold over the ends to meet in the middle .Then simply place the wrong side against your face, loop the hair ties around your ears, and voila.You’re welcome.FASHION designer Freya Edmondson – daughter of Ab Fab star Jenner Saunders and actor Ade Edmondson – has posted this photo of herself doing a “sumptuous, heart-opening backbend”, while writing on a notepad.Freya, who teaches free online yoga courses, is just  and, therefore, wonderfully flexible.As a former enthusiastic gymnast, it reminds me of my youth, when I would watch TV while doing the box splits – with my legs stretched out at right angles to my body.With my th birthday looming this Sunday,I attempted it now it would take four paramedics and a system of pulleys to get me on my feet again.ACADEMICS may lord it over the rest of us when it comes to quadratic equations, subatomic phenomena or the three components of the epidemiological triangle, but when it comes to common sense they are often found lacking.Quite how “Professor Lockdown” Neil Ferguson thought he could preach to the rest of us about social distancing while inviting his mistress to his house is anyone’s guess, but he did, and now he’s rightly had to resign for hypocrisynothing .He says: “I accept I made an error . . . I thought I was immune.”From Covid- . . . or criticism THE latest series of Killing Eve may have had a lukewarm reception from critics, but central character Villanelle’s fashion choices have been attracting a lot of attention.One frock cost £,, another £,, and her red leather catsuit would set you back an eye-watering £,.I know these are desperate times for all businesses, but since when have fashionistas been clamouring to get their clothes on the back of a psychotic murderer It gives a whole new meaning to “dressed to kill”.HAIRDRESSERS are to stay closed until July  at the earliest.Up to now I have been making do with the occasional fringe cut using a pair of nail scissors.But given that my “style”is supposed to be choppy bob, and I now resemble Richard lll, it seems I will have to tackle the rest of it too.Worse, The Bloke will have to do the back and, God forbid, baldlygo where no man has gone before.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The UK’s , overall deaths, and the stubbornly high daily toll, tell their own story.

Those who fall short will deserve the flak they get.But le involves risk. Covid- has made it a fraction riskier still. We will do ourselves MORE damage long-term by refusing to venture back.Once-healthy firms are staring into the abyss. Today’s GDP figures will be dire.

Covid may be with us for years.

By our supermarket workers, delivery drivers and bus drivers.

And I’ll admit, I didn’t correct the ­lawyer .But there’s a darker side to it. A generation of young city dwellers who know nothing about Britain were always bound to underestimate our four great nations.And so they did in the  referendum.The overlap between London and the Remain campaign has been well documented —  per cent of the capital voted in favour of remaining in the EU.Among London’s student population, the depth of ­support for the EU was overwhelming.And with some ultra-liberal friends, there were moments when it would have seemed easier to come out as a ­paedophile than a Brexiteer.Of course, ardent young Remainers convinced themselves that their love of the European Union was borne out of a sophisticated appreciation of all things global.But it seems more likely to me that they saw the EU as the ­saviour to a backwards, grisly country they imagined in their ignorance to be Britain.This summer, that ignorance could finally be shattered.Thanks to Covid-, the nation’s young people won’t have the option of scurrying to ­Heathrow the second their uni exams are over.Instead —they want holidays at all — they’ll be minibreaking in Manchester or camping in the English countryside.Yes, they might turn their noses up at rolling hills, stunning architecture and incredible free museums.But I have a sneaking suspicion they’ll be surprised and impressed with what they find beyond the confines of the M.And, reconnected to their roots at last, they might just begin to feel the first stirrings of patriotism running through their British veins.When the Government published its new guidelines for lockdown in England, I – like the rest of Twitter – found myself getting very worked up about whether or not I’m allowed to play tennis with someone outside of my household.The problem, as my mum gently reminded me, is that in my case it’s a bit of a moot point: I’ve never played tennis before and I’m not entirely sure how to hold a racket.I doubt either my housemate or my friends will be begging for a game any time soon.IT’S not often I find myself welling up at the radio. But LBC caller Liz, from Witham, Essex, got me in the gut this week.Through uncontrollable tears, she explained thatcoronavirus didn’t kill her, being forbidden from touching her grand-children surely would.She’s not alone. After nearly two gruelling months of lockdown, millions of us are experiencing real, gut-wrenching loneliness.They don’t like to complain – they know their suffering is dwarfed by that of frontline health and care staffers. But starved of the company of those they love, they are withering like plants out of sunshine.You’d expect a Conservative government instinctively to get this. For generations, Tory MPs have told us that family is crucially important to the ing of the UK.They’ve thrown their weight behind policies designed to strengthen families and made many moving speeches about how a family unit is more than the sum of its parts.But it seems all that was just for show. For in their admirable haste to propel Brits back to work, this Government seems to have forgotten about families altogether.Boris Johnson’s Sunday night speech – stuffed full of specic advice for workers – didn’t have a single word of hope for single adult relatives craving each other’s company.And the millions of young adults longing to know when they can next hug Mum will have been bitterly disappointed.Of course, the PM is right to say we need to get the economy going again.Forecasts from the Treasury on the upcoming recession could hardly be more alarming – and despite the best efforts of Chancellor Rishi Sunak and his bailouts, millions of businesses will go bustthey can’t get up and running again soon.Butwe’re expected to get up close with colleagues for the sake of the economy, surely we should get to see those we love best for the sake of our mental health The people of Britain are humans, not cash cows. Andthey are to get through this long, draining war in one piece, they need the support of the people they love.LISTENING to BBC News anchor Fiona Bruce casually describe carers as “low-skilled workers” really set my teeth on edge.To the shame of this nation, care home staff are indeed low paid.But low skilled  I reckon plenty of them would be more than capable of reading the news from an autocue for £, a year.And I’d like to see cofed Fiona feed, clean and comfort a newly widowed dementia sufferer without losing her cool.FOR the best part of the past decade, bespectacled “experts” gravely predicted that online dating would kill romance.Apps – they told us – would transform the dating scene into an endless virtual marketplace where singles could shop for each other , or  would turn dating into a minimal-effort pursuit of on-demand hook ups .How wrong they were.Rather than bonking their way round new digital acquaintances, millennial Brits in the st Century spend their downtime uploading photos and biographies to their smartphones and earnestly looking for love.And my, do they succeed.Last year a whopping  per cent of newly married couples met online, and Hinge – the dating app geared towards lelong relationships – is gaining users faster than any of its competitors.Granted, these apps aren’t perfect.We all like a good romance story, and Dad messaging Mum with a winky face because he liked her bikini selfie is hardly the stuff of Hollywood.But now that flirting in the pub is a thing of the past, let’s thank our lucky stars that the country’s poor singles have a shot at love at all.Rather than sitting on the sofa twiddling their thumbs, furloughed folk have been busy sculpting, chiselling and painting – and selling the fruits of their labours online.These plucky, small-time entrepreneurs are the very best of Britain.And with them around, I have no doubt this country will be back on its feet in no time.I’M absolutely loving Normal People on BBC.The chemistry between Marianneand Connellis really quite something.And as an ode to young love, the whole thing is pitch-perfect.In fact, my only quibble is why on earth are all the characters so darn sophisticated They’re , for goodness sake.Let’s see fewer candle-lit, red wine-soaked dinner parties and more tins of warm Foster’s. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Obviously we cant predict precisely so were estimating it on dferent sources of information so things like hospital admissions that have happened historically.And then I think thirdly importantly, we know that we have slightly dferent R values relating to some areas of risks.So obviously in recent weeks, care homes have been heightened interest, hospitals also and we keep an eye on those. So this is very much a national average.Scientists use it to predict how far and how fast a disease will spread - and the number can also inform policy decisions about how to contain an outbreak.For example,a virus has an R of three, it means that every sick person will pass the disease on to three other peopleno containment measures are introduced.Its also worth pointing out that the R is a measure of how infectious a disease is, but not how deadly.On Sunday, Boris Johnson said that the R rate was between . and . - but urged the British public to help keep it below .In his address to the nation, he said: It depends on all of us – the entire country – to follow the advice, to observe social distancing, and to keep that R down.He added: We must make sure that any measures we take do not force the reproduction rate of the disease - the R - back up over one so that we have the kind of exponential growth we were facing a few weeks ago.Sir Patrick Vallance, the Governments chief scientic adviser said: “R is one of the important things you can track to understand an epidemic.If you can estimate R, then you have part of a reliable tool for planning how to combat the virus.“If the R is higher than one that means this disease is growing exponentially and will keep on spreading to more and more people.To keep R below one and control the virus, it is vital that people stay alert and continue to follow the latest Government guidelines to the letter.“In the coming weeks, we will update this estimate regularly.”Ministers have been faced with a balancing act between keeping the R value and death rate down - and ensuring that Britains economy does not totally collapse.The PM made only small tweaks to the lockdown rules this week when people were encouraged toto workthey couldnt do their job from home.Unlimited exercise was also put back on the cards while iniduals are now free to meet one person from another household at a safe distance outdoors in a park.But Mr Johnson warned that stricter measures could be rolled out againneeded.Scientic experts have been advising the Government on how each option for unlocking the country could affect the R value.Around one in three Brits - .million people - may already have been infected with coronavirus, experts say.The World Health Organisationestimated at the start of March that the coronavirus R value stands somewhere between  and ..In comparison, the seasonal flu is estimated to be roughly . while measles has a reproductive value of between  and .The apparently rising “R” released yesterday reflects restrictions three weeks ago, has nothing to do with the lockdown being eased . . . and includes care homes and hospital infections.This matters, for millions of workers. And for teachers, whose risk from ing to school is being exaggerated by their unions even though it is statistically tiny, as Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries says.Our tentative steps back to freedom, back to work and towards rebuilding our economy must not be delayed by how many old folk are still catching the virus in care, as heartbreaking as that is.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Medical researchers expressed scepticism in mid-April, after Wuhan revised the number of coronavirus deaths from , to , - an increase of exactly  per cent.Their report says:To access the military university’s website hosting the map for the first time, one of the reports authors had to use a virtual private network to pretend he was browsing in Uruguay.They are not making the database publicly available for reasons of security, but are exploring ways to make the data available for researchers studying the spread of the coronavirus.Beijing might be restricting access to its coronavirus data because of malice or mistrust toward the United States, at a time when tensions are running high, the authors say.But Reporters says its likely that Beijing fears that outside researchers will learn of its extensive cover-up, destroying the narrative that an authoritarian nation like China is better equipped to protect its people against a pandemic.The original dataset that was leaked to the organisation appears to have been overseen by Zhang Haisu, a director at the university’s Information and Communication Department. In a May press release, the institution credits Zhang for building the “Fight the Virus to Return to Work Database” and praises his dedication.But, it’s unclear as yet how the university gathered the data from hotels, supermarkets, railway stations, restaurants, and schools across the country, plus a KFC and a church.However, according to the universitys online information, cases were aggregated from China’s health ministry, the National Health Commission, media reports, and other public sources.The university, based in the central Chinese city of Changsha, is “under the direct leadership of the Central Military Commission,” the body that oversees China’s military. The Chinese Army has played a large role in mobilising against the virus, by enforcing quarantines, transporting supplies, and treating patients, says Reporters. A propaganda message on a prominent military website in China reads, “in the fight against the epidemic, the people’s army is on the move!”The leaked data could not be independently veried.The stats coincide with a huge task underway in Wuhan, where there are fears the city at the epicentre of the original outbreak faces a threatened second wave of infections.Following a cluster of cases last weekend - the first since a lockdown was lted on April  - the city is busy conducting a mammoth  million tests on citizens.Meanwhile, a of words is continuing between Beijing and Washington - where President Donald Trump refuses to believe Chinas official tally.In an interview with Fox, Trump said he was very disappointed with Chinas failure to contain the disease, and that the pandemic was a hurdle after his January trade deal with Beijing, which he has previously hailed as a major achievement.But Chinas ambassador to the United Nations in Vienna, Wang Qun, slammed Trumps criticism.He said that America has done its utmost to engage itself in blaming games and stigmatisation of China, and WHO, so as to sht its own responsibility for ineffective control of the pandemic in the US.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Downing Street today confirmed there isnapost a French exemption to  daysapos quarantine - which will soon be mandatory for most people who arrive from any nation into the UK. That appears to crush widespread reports that UK holidaymakers could be able to escape across the Channel later this summer. Reports had claimed a quarantine-free apostravel corridorapos could be set up between the UK, France and Ireland later in the year. But sources today indicated most UK arrivals from France will not be able to avoid  daysapos quarantine - just like from every other nation in the world.  The UK government is preparing to force all arrivals at all ports and airports to go into self-isolation for  days, starting in a few weeks. People will be ordered to give the address they are quarantining at, andthey do not, could be forced into a government-run quarantine facility. Itaposs understood officials are looking at exemptions for some people who arrive to the UK from France - such as freight drivers or scientists working on the pandemic. But those exemptions will only be tightly drawn, a senior government source said. Hopes had been raised on Sunday night, when the UK and France said no quarantine measures would apply to arrivals from France at this stage.Yet Downing Street has since emphasised that the statement only said at this stage - not in the future, when quarantine actually comes into force. Boris Johnsonaposs official spokesman said today: There isn’t a French exemption. “What the statement at the weekend said was no quarantine measures apply to France at this stage. “What it went on to say is that we’d be working with the French in the coming weeks, because co-operation is particularly necessary for the management of our common border. “And that any steps which we do take would be implemented in a concerted and reciprocal manner.”  Exemptions could include freight drivers who are transporting goods from mainland Europe in general - not just originating in France. And scientists who are working on a vaccine, for example, could be allowed to pass in and out on the Eurostar without staying for two weeks. But sources were unable to confirmgeneral business travel will be allowed. It is understood French and UK officials are still working on exact rules for any exemptions. Askedthe government was ruling out any exemption for holidaymakers, Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman pointed out why the rules existed in the first place - to stop a new outbreak from overseas.

It comes amid continuing privacy concerns about the NHS coronavirus tracking app, which is being tested on the Isle of Wight ahead of a planned national rollout in “mid May.” The government said The Care Workforce app was developed by NHSX. It was advertised as a “a single one-stop-shop providing the sector with all the latest guidance, wellbeing support and advice they need to protect themselves from COVID- and keep themselves well.” But the app is built on a system operated by Hive Learning Limited, a private tech firm. To use the app, staff have to provide their name, email, region, the postcode of their employer and their job role. The app’s terms of use said the data can be used “to distribute our marketing information” - allowing private sector firms to advertise special offers to workers. The appaposs privacy policy was changed today, and no longer includes the language about marketing information. And the terms of use now includes a pledge not to use the information for marketing purposes. But the Mirror has seen screenshots of special offers from supermarkets and high street stores being displayed to care workers using the app. Concerns have also been raised about the app’s web chat , which is searchable by anyone. Some users of the app have used theto complain about PPE and working conditions, with their comments easily identiable by bosses. A selection of comments, which could include sensitive information, are automatically emailed to new users when they sign up. The Mirror has seen comments emailed to new users which include comments about testing provision and the health status of workers.  Rehana Azam, GMB National Secretary, said: Exposing users personal details on this app in this way is grossly incompetent at best  - but we say itaposs a downright betrayal of key workers whichever way you look at it. Health and care workers are terried of speaking out about the dangerous lack of PPE in case they get reprimanded or sacked by their employer for raising the issue. Now the Government launches an app that slaps their private data all over the place for anyone to see. Bosses can quite easily use it to spy on workers, see what theyaposre saying and potentially sanction them. “These key workers are highly skilled, but chronically underpaid. They already feel hugely undervalued and GMB advises them not to use this app. The blame for this disaster must land at the door of the Health Secretary.

Leaders in Hartlepool have joined those in Liverpool by rejecting the plans which unions have slammed as putting teachers and children at risk. Union chiefs have accused ministers of going too fast and want more local control over theof schoolchildren.In a statement, Hartlepool Council said: Given that coronavirus cases locally continue to rise, Hartlepool Council has been working with schools and we have agreed they will not reopen on Monday  June.Whilst we recognise the importance of schools reopening, we want to be absolutely clear that we will be taking a measured and cautious approach to this.  We continue to work with schools to put in place appropriate measures to help keep children and staff safe when a phased reopening is possible. Patrick Roach, general secretary of union NASUWT, yesterday said it would take legal action against head teachersschools re-opened without proper protections for staff. But in an extraordinary turn, former Education Secretary David Blunkett has accused the unions of working against the interests of children. And Sir Anthony Seldon, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Buckingham and ex-head of Wellington College, said: Teachers want to and need to be back in schools.  As long as the scientists say they can, it is utterly wrong for unions to try to block and discourage teachers. While current Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has urged the unions to do their duty and halt any opposition to getting children back behind their desks despite the pandemic. Writing for the Daily Mail, he said ing kids to school is in the interests of their welfare and education. In Liverpool, city leaders said it was more likely school would notuntil mid-June- and children of key workers wouldfirst.  In a letter to parents, Liverpool councilaposs director for children and young peopleaposs services Steve Reddy warned: “There is no doubt in my mind that we simply cannot reopen schools in line with the suggested timetable outlined by the government. The layout of every school is dferent and they all have dferent challenges to overcome in terms of maintaining social distancing and hygiene. Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson warned earlier this week that he would resist sending kids back at the beginning of next month, saying he had concerns about whether schools would be able to operate safely. He told BBC Newsnight: “I’m not going to take risks with children’s lives or with staff and teaching professionalsapos lives.”  The city councilaposs decision comes after Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, also split from the governmentaposs schools timeline. England is the only part of the UK asking schools to begin phased reopenings from the start of next month. Schools in Wales will not open on June , First Minister Mark Drakeford earlier confirmed.Prime Minister  Boris Johnson  set out plans to encourage the UK get back to normal after the coronavirus lockdown.One of the measures was to partially bring children back into primary schools, from Reception, Year  and Year .  The Department for Education said that kids would be kept apart in small groups, regular hand washing would be encouraged, and those with coronavirus symptoms would be asked not to go into school. But teaching unions have rejected the plans, saying teachers and children would be at risk of catching the disease and accelerating its spread back out in the community. In the North-east the aposRapos transmission rate is the highest in the country at around . - in London, the initial epicentre of the outbreak, itaposs .. On Friday, education unions were invited to a meeting with Government ministers and scientists about their plan. But union leader Dr Roach said the meeting has raised more questions than answers. He said the evidence to reopen on June  was weak and no new evidence had been provided. No confirmation was provided that teachers are at low risk of catching the virus following the wider opening of schools, he said. No clear information was provided on what modelling has been undertaken in relation to potential transmission rates when schools open more widely. Nothing in the meeting provided reassurance for the deeply worried and anxious school workforce.

Gatherings of more than two people remain banned, so people cannot meet both their parents, for example Play golf and tennis Golf courses and tennis courts will reopen from May , with social distancing relatively easy to achieve, although you can play only with people in your household.

Erin Harveyaposs son Zac Harvey died in the tragic inferno earlier this year, when a fire ripped through the dad Shaun Harveyaposs home at around am during a weekend sleepover with his children. Although unable to save Zac, Shaun managed to reach his other son Harley and rescue him. Harley, four, was left in a critical condition after the fire in Ffair Rhos near Pontrhydfendigaid, Wales. He was given little chance of surviving his injuries and newly released photos from hospital show the extent of the ordeal he has gone through. But boyaposs mum has revealed that he is making an amazing recovery - even attending school before lockdown. Police say an investigation into the cause of the fire in the early hours of Sunday, January  is still ongoing but it is not being treated as suspicious. Erin said: Zac was such a little ray of sunshine, always so happy and cheeky. Our home is very quiet now he’s gone. Harley and his brother Alex are coping well at the moment, and we’ve got support in place.  It’s something that will never get any easier and our family will never be the same again. She described having nurses and doctors to help around the clock when Harley eventually left hospital, after around six weeks. Harley was airlted to Bristol Children’s Hospital after the fire, where he stayed until  February. He was home by the end of the month. Erin added: The first few weeks of adjusting to home le was hard, after having nurses and doctors to help around the clock to being on my own with Harley.  It was worrying for me, but Harley adapted to the change well. We soon got into a routine of medications, baths, dressing changes and creams. He was in a wheelchair for the first few weeks but you wouldn’t even think it now. He’s definitely back to his active self. He still can’t do all the things he could before and needs help with things like eating and toilet trips. He doesn’t have fullof his left hand, but to our amazement he wiggled his fingers for the first time the other day. He’s definitely making progress. He had done two afternoons back in Pontrhydfendigaid School before lockdown happened, and he can’t wait until he can go back and see all his friends. The teachers have been a massive support to us and still continue to check in on us all via phone.  We are waiting for an appointment with his consultant to discuss his next surgery. It’s going to be a long road, but the way Harley takes it all and excels in every way possible makes it much easier on us all as a family. The staff at Morriston Burns Unit have been amazing. I would like to thank everyone who is supporting us along our journey. The tragic fire shocked the community in the remote village earlier this year. Neighbours described the screams of devastated dad Shaun, , in the aftermath of the fire.

You can unsubscribe at any time.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email Natalie Poole arrived on the remote island of Kyun Pila in Myanmar on March  and planned to spend the next month working as a volunteer to help protect a coral reef - but then coronavirus hit.The -year-old, from Ashburton in Devon, is now trapped in a real le castaway drama after her only boat off the island was cancelled as Myanmar and nearby Thailand both went into lockdown. For the last two months, Natalie and four other volunteers have been forced to survive almost without any aid in one of the worldaposs most remote locations. Natalie and her fellow volunteers were due to be rescued on May  but were left devastated again when their boat was cancelled after Thailand extended its lockdown. The scuba er instructor, who should be back in Devon by now and working as a summer school teacher, is hopeful another boat will arrive to collect them later this month. However, her visa has expired and no new ones are being issued while the coronavirus pandemic holds the world in its grip. Natalie said: The hardest thing for me has been not knowing how long weaposre going to be here. Itaposs kind of up and down, weaposre a very small group of people and weaposre living in a very confined, close situation. In the back of our minds is obviously families back home and stuff, which adds to the tension a little bit. Weaposre just trying to take things day by day. But for now, the tiny group have had to do what they can to survive, using washed up bits of plastic to make their rainforest camp. They share the island with scorpions, snakes, mouse-deer, wild boar, monitor lizards, and slow lorises, and have to forage for most of their food, including yams, jackfruit and other vegetation. There have been sporadic deliveries by boat of food staples, including rice and pasta. But the group are conscious they have to make sure these last as they donapost know when the next one will arrive - and there have been plenty of days where they have gone hungry. Natalie said: We have to be very aware of how much we consume, we are eating very basic food and really having to make it last. Despite the desperate situation the group, which is made up of two women and three men from England, Hungary, Canada, Malaysia and France, find themselves in - they are not totally alone. There is one resort on Kyun Pila, Awei Pila, which is a  minute dinghy sail away and where they can access water, showers and accomodation on portable cabins, as well as a patchy wi signal. This has proved a leline for Natalie, who is concerned for her -year-old father, who lives in Poole in the UK. But the group, who are volunteers with environmental group Ocean Quest Global, have had to adapt quickly to spending so much extra time on the island. Their jungle camp has been constructed from washed up plastic, with each person living in a hut made from bamboo, rice sacks and bottles. They have even managed to erect furniture in their new Robinson Crusoe-inspired le, have dug a well, a fire pit and place to wash.The volunteers have also started planting their own vegetables. There are other challenges for the small group, existing in such extreme circumstances. Natalie explained: Usually in a programme like this there is a regular change of volunteers, which keeps things fresh and interesting, but the other three volunteers have been with each other a long time now and relationships are strained at times. Communal living is always a challenge because you get so little personal space and have to compromise a great deal. One person’s negative attitude or bad mood will affect everyone. The group has been forced to adapt to their change in circumstances, with people learning to hack jungle trails, drive a dingy and build with bamboo. Natalie has earned herself the nickname Trash Squirrel by spending her days combing the beach for washed up waste that can then be put to use to build the structures theyaposre calling home and to be turned into useful tools for surivival. But as spring slowly turns into summer Natalie and her fellow volunteers are facing a new challenge - the tropical rainy season. Already the clouds are coming in faster and the first few drops of rain have started to fall. They are working to do all they can to ensure they are as ready as possible for when the downpours do come.  However, Natalie is still hopeful that a rescue boat will come for them before the rainy season begins in earnest. She says it has also been a useful time for getting to know herself better. Natalie explained: I learned that no matter how Zen and chilled I had thought I was, in moments of solitude and dficult moments of physical and mental tiredness, I still lose control and stop being mindful and calm. That no matter how friendly and cheerful I usually am, when I am locked down on a relatively small island with strangers, I become moody, grumpy and little motivated.

The scene has ided social media users, with some supporting Miss Hussain while others blast her behaviour.

Ms Boebi, who has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome , was worried she was vulnerable to the virus especially in London, so travelled to Blackpool with her girlfriend, who is from the seaside town in Lancashire and whose sister had a spare room. Her novel lockdown surroundings went viral last week when she tweeted: I canapost believe I sold all of my belongings and left my dream house in Los Angeles to travel Europe in  and now for six months Iaposll be stuck in Blackpool, England. Her medical condition means she needs to isolate, so Ms Boebi said she canapost really tell where she is except for the sounds of seagulls and during the Clap For Carers on Thursday evenings. Theyaposre all so sweet and they bang their pans and some guy comes out with a megaphone and says apos anybody needs any tea, pop by Iaposll give you someapos, she said. I love the North of England way more than London... when Iaposm in the North I can be like aposoh my god I like your scarfapos and they will be like aposoh my god I like your hairapos.

As a disabled person, Ms Boebi added that she hopes people are learning about access issues while in lockdown. EDS is a rare genetic condition which in Ms Boebiaposs case is accompanied by mass cell activation syndrome, which often causes symptoms of an allergic reaction, and postural tachycardia syndrome, a heart condition. Which just makes it dficult for me to do things, like standing up for more than five minutes, said Ms Boebi. Ms Boebi said she is loving the new accessibility brought about during the pandemic, such as working from home and online meetings, but raised issues with the way change has been brought by the virus.

The snap of the mindless act just outside Bolsover, Derbyshire, emerged after the ClearWaste app revealed cases have soared an average % – with some London boroughs hit by % increases. The alarming surge was driven by closures of tips and fewer bin collections under the Covid- lockdown, plus more waste being generated as self-isolating people did clear-outs, DIY and gardening. Other shocking images show a dozen bin bags full of household waste and broken electrical goods dumped in an idyllic woodland area in Aylesbury Vale, Buckinghamshire. And in Dartford, Kent, two lorry loads of tyres were just left by a roadside. Last weekend, fly-tippers dumped a ft pile of tyres, roof felt and insulation  near a mining memorial in the village of Halmerend, just outside Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. It honours more than  men and boys killed in England’s worst wartime mining disaster – an underground e­xplosion at the Minnie Pit in . Dozens of bin bags were also dumped at Soar cemetery in Llanelli, South Wales, this week, while  bags filled with broken mirrors, old clothes and household waste were left on the side of the ­mountains in Ebbw Vale. Earlier this week, people queued for hours to get rid of weeks of accumulated waste as many recycling centres and tips reopened. Councils urged only those with waste posing a health or safety risk to visit and shared links to webcams to help residents avoid queues. Martin Montague, who set up the ClearWaste fly-tipping reporting website and app, said: “We’ve seen a huge increase since lockdown.  It is disgraceful and adds to the burden on police and council workers, not to mention the cost and inconvenience to farmers working hard to keep the nation supplied with milk, meat and vegetables. “At the moment, householders must store things they’d normally take to a tip. “Don’t hand unwanted stuff to just any person with a van who offers to remove it for a bit of cash.

The remaining winners received cheques ranging from £, and £,, depending on how many tickets they play with. Local finance worker Louise Harris was among the big £, prize winners. She said: “I’m totally speechless. I never expected to win this kind of money and the champagne will definitely be popping tonight.  Since hearing my postcode area had won, I haven’t been able to stop singing the ‘someone’s knockin’ at the door’ song. I’m ecstatic.” Louise has a few ideas on how she’ll put her winnings to good use, including a few treats for her nine-year-old daughter, Daytona. She added: Daytona had her heart set on a dressing table for her bedroom. She kept saying ‘it will be a big win, mum, I’m sure’ and she was right! I’ve also always wanted to take her on a safari holiday. South Africa would be top of my list and thanks to winning, I’ll be able to make it even more memorable for us both.” Nursery teacher Joanne James, , and her husband Huw, also landed £,. She said: This is going to make a huge dference to us. Our children, Tom and Georgina, both have bad eyesight, and this means we’ll be able to get the operation that our Georgie needs. That just by playing we are helping raise money for charity is hugely important to me. I lost my mum to cancer and I suffered so badly with the loss. What charities do to support people is just incredible and so important.

Emma Revie, chief executive of the Trussell Trust charity, told the Environment, Food and Rural AffairsCommittee on Friday that more and more families were going without food. She said that Covid- had an instantaneous and profound impact on the number of people using foodbanks. We analysed the last two weeks of March, compared to the same time last year and we identied that there was an % increase in demand and quite alarmingly a % increase in the number of children receiving food, she added. What this told us was the number of families with children that were coming to us had doubled from its normal levels, so weaposre definitely seeing a disproportionately high number of children. Ms Revie said children not attending school was part of the issue, but not the whole reason behind the spike in demand. MPs were also told how consumer stockpiling in March led to a dramatic drop in supplies going to foodbanks. Lindsay Boswell, CEO of FareShare, a charity aimed at relieving food poverty, said: Initially with the dramatic increase in consumer demand and clearing of shelves and stocking that went on, our supply chain was cut off at the knees. The supermarkets, although they reacted incredibly quickly, had to ert all their attention and focus into just trying to find whatever supply they could.  We have about , charities that collect food from the back of supermarket stores on a daily basis, as well as the other , that are supplied through a wholesale model and we saw a dramatic drop. But Mr Boswell went on to say the amount of produce in foodbanks increased following the closure of pubs and restaurants. He added: Whataposs been incredibly bad news for that sector, weaposve managed to ert a lot of that food and make a massive dference to frontline organisations. Last week we reported on how a disabled mum and her husband have been forced to go hungry and feed their four kids frozen food due to the failure of a lunch voucher scheme. After the Government closed all schools in the UK to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, it was announced that families would be sent lunch vouchers to stop their children going hungry.All kids who received a free school meal at school would be entitled to a £ voucher a week to be spent in supermarkets.

Her Majesty has instructed a team of builders to resume work on the £ million refurbishment of Buckingham Palace now that the Government has eased lockdown measures.The -year-old monarch has wasted no time in ordering the swt restart of the project which was stalled as workers were confined to their homes by the coronavirus pandemic. Her decisive stance echoes Boris Johnson ’s call for Britain’s workers toto work this week to try and drive the country out of its economic turmoil.She has sought to set an example to the country by calling for a resumption of the major reservicing project after a seven-week halt.  The -year taxpayer-funded project to give the Queen’s official London residence a facelt and make it fit for the st century had to be put largely on hold when Boris Johnson brought in Covid- restrictions on March . Contractors were told not to travel to the palace to work and much of the project was shut down, although some jobs, including designing, procurement and planning, were done remotely. But the renovation and refurbishment work inside the palace has now restarted. In fact it resumed on May  even before Boris Johnson went on television on May  and urged construction workers toto work. A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: “After a temporary suspension, reservicing programme operations have safely restarted at Buckingham Palace. “Operations have begun in a phased manner to allow for effective social distancing across the sites. With the wellbeing of staff and relevant government advice in mind, a limited number of contractors have been permitted on site initially.  “Additional work has been continuing remotely wherever possible, including progressing with designs, procurement and planning for future stages of the project.” Palace officials had been looking for clear signals from the Government after mixed messages in the early days of lockdown over whether “non-essential” construction sites should remain open. But they are now confident that the reservicing project can be resumed safely while adhering to Government guidelines. At the same time the Queen and other members of the Royal Family have undertaken all their official engagements remotely since March  to avoid sending mixed messages and contradicting Government guidance, as they believe they can continue to work from home. Aides say that is unlikely to change in the near future. At  the Queen is in a vulnerable group and is expected to stay cocooned with Prnce Philip, , and a much-reduced retinue of staff at Windsor Castle. Prince Charles and Camilla are likely to remain at Birkhall on the Balmoral estate while the Scottish government under Nicola Sturgeon is telling people north of the border to stay at home. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are holed up at Anmer Hall, their country retreat in Norfolk, with their children. Other members of the Royal Family have remained at home during the pandemic restrictions. Exercise Unlimited exercise outdoors is to be allowed, with the previous aposonce-a-dayapos rule scrapped Sunbathing People will be allowed to sit on parks and beaches, provided they stay two metres away from other people Drive Boris Johnson said in his speech on Sunday night that people will be able to drive to other destinations from Wednesday, presumably to exercise there, although more detailed plans are likely to follow Meet others From May , people will be able to meet one friend or relative from a dferent household in a public place, provided they stay two metres apart. Gatherings of more than two people remain banned, so people cannot meet both their parents, for example Play golf and tennis Golf courses and tennis courts will reopen from May , with social distancing relatively easy to achieve, although you can play only with people in your household. Team sports such as football are not likely to be encouraged, as social distancing is dficult and more people than the average household would be required Fishing and swimming Angling and water sports are also to be allowed to resume in England from Wednesday. Again, you must be within your own household and two metres from other people Return to work Rather than a change to the rules, the government is now encouraging people toto workthey cannot do so from home. But they also urge people to drive, walk or cycle to work rather than use public transport,possible Until the crisis Royal Household officials had prided themselves on sticking rigidly to the Buckingham Palace reservicing timetable but the six-week lay off is likely to now put the project behind schedule. The Covid- crisis may also have financial implications for the project after forcing officials to abandon the summer opening of Buckingham Palace to tourists and keeping other royal residences, such as Windsor Castle, closed to paying visitors. That may create a black hole in the royal coffers, as the Royal Collection Trust, the charity that oversees tourism at royal residences, pays a £ million facility fee to the Royal Household for the privilege of bringing in visitors and a big chunk of it, although not all of it, will be lost. That fee bolsters the £. million the Queen currently receives from the taxpayer under the Sovereign Grant, which is equivalent to  per cent of the Crown Estate profits. Royal finance expert David McClure, author of the forthcoming book Royal Privilege, said: “If the Sovereign Grant loses the income from Buckingham Palace visitors, then one way or another the taxpayer will have to pay for the shortfall. “Many people wrongly believe that the Sovereign Grant is funded by Crown Estates profits but in reality this is just an index mechanism and it is the taxpayer who foots the bill.

Parents were warned in a letter today that the school-gates were unlikely to reopen by that deadline as the UK remains under the strict coronavirus lockdown. Liverpool councilaposs director for children and young peopleaposs services Steve Reddy said only the children of key workers were likely to be back at school on Monday, June , the target date the government set for some schools to reopen, reports the Liverpool Echo In Wales First Minister Mark Drakeford has confirmed schools will not open on June . Mr Drakeford said that while his Government was committed to getting children back into the classrooms, that is it would work with teaching unions to do it. NASUWT carried out a survey of its members asking aposWhat concerns,any, do you have about theto full school opening aposA total of  teachers responded and with their concerns with issues raised including fears of spreading coronavirus, no PPE, social distancing being impossible to enforce, poor ventilation, student anxiety, lunch times that go on for hours, quality of cleaning and shared apparatus. I feel we are being put at unnecessary risk so parents canto their work Social distancing. We are currently working in school on a rota basisfor key workers children and it is impossible to social distance even when we only have a small number of children. Hygiene is impossible to maintain even though we do lots of hand washing and wipe shared surfaces but you canapost do that all day. Children do not understand. We share lots of resources too which cannot always be cleaned after every use but we donapost have enough for every child. We have no PPE equipment and feel we are all completely at risk. I am very worried about schools reopening. I feel we are being put at unnecessary risk so parents canto their work where social distancing will be more controlled or be easier to control. Trying to social distance in toilets and corridors will be impossible. Our corridors are very narrow and we are a large school. Lunch times would end up taking all by limiting the children allowed in the hall at any one time. The quality of teaching would suffer as weaposd have to limit resources, group work and spend most of the day cleaning!  Weaposre not invincible and do not want to be a part of an experiment Safety, number one, first and foremost. I worry about the safety of the children, especially as a parent myself, because children can catch the virus and react badly, however limited the numbers. I worry about the safety of all of the staff, because eventhe children are less affected, it doesnapost mean the adults that share the classroom space with them are. We are not invincible and we do not want to be a part of an experiment to check how much the children will spread this. I worry about an increase in the spread of the virus within the community after schools reopen and therefore, the safety of all. Regardless of how effected children are, we know they spread things. They may also not even show the symptomsit is mild for them and we will not know they have it necessarily. They will spread to the adults in school, they will then spread this to their adults at home, who in turn will spread it around the wider community and those who are vulnerable will be at increased risk once again. More people are, sadly, likely to diethey reopen the schools too early or fail to make sure that social distancing is adhered to. Social distancing in any school, but especially schools in the UK is realistically going to be nigh on impossible. I canapost fit the number of children in my tiny classroom at the best of times, we are on top of one another. I think Iaposd fit  children inI was lucky with  metres apart. Not to mention break and lunch times and how it could ever work to keep them apart. Or enough water and soap even! Weaposd need a large portion of time a day just to get school children to regularly wash their hands. Thereaposd be limited time for learning. We need to know itaposs safe before we . The numbers need to be manageable. We will likely need PPE. It cannot go ahead without every assurance of our safety. It shouldnapost happen before September to try to ensure this is the case.  This frightens me and I do not want to go back to work If social distancing continues in public post lockdown, how can we maintain this in schools, with class sizesover  pupils, over  pupils moving around the school site to the next lesson every hour, break and lunches. Children may be a lower risk, but what about us staff  What about the idea that children are carriers, and could bring and pass on germs from home. It makes no sense to put so many schools at risk in this way, would this not just start a new spike in cases  Honestly this frightens me and I do not want to go back to work, despite not being high risk,social distancing is to continue across the country but not in schools !!  It should be a full opening only when safe to do so You cannot get primary age children to stay m apart! We are trying in school but so dficult. Some staff will not be able toto wok due to health or family health reasons and who is going to sort the online learning for those still at home. We will have to be doing  jobsnot fully open. Partial opening WILL NOT work as still doing the on line learning and feedback for half then actually in school. Canapost do  things at once. Risk of a second wave Not having PPE it enough of it. Children with special educational needs and disabilities do not understand distancing or the need to wash their hands. At risk due to spitting. Utterly terried about the prospect I am constantly upset anxious and fearful at the prospect. . It is not possible to ensure social distancing with  ks children. The very nature of a KS class means they are super spreadersof all germs. Therefore, I would not be able to keep my class safe, myself or in turn my own children and family. I will not send my own children ks and  back to school until I consider it safe for them. Social distancing is impossible when working with students with SEN. PPE consists of gloves and aprons which we already have due to the close contact personal carepupils. Staff and students are not protected from Corona virus.  Petried in all honesty We have a very old building - oversubscribed and big classes. I teach  hours of single lessons a week meaning I come into contact with roughly  students per week. We historically have an ‘uncaring’ management and I worry we will just be thrown back into teaching . Really scared. Many pupils have really dirty and unscrupulous habits Sneezing and coughing without protection - over other pupils, staff, onto the tables, never carrying tissues or handkerchieves, perception of it being socially unacceptable to blow their noses, snfing large amounts of phlegm or wiping it on their sleeves. Pupils not washing hands and vandalising toilets. Lack of regular and inadequate cleaning of tables and equipment. Total inability to enforce social distancing. Some cramped classrooms and overcrowding. Pupils congregating in large groups, particularly in toilets and inadequate staff numbers to deal with splitting them up. Lack of room within school corridors for passing each other, lack of proper seating areas for eatingPupils constantly touching each othernot respecting distance between themselves and staff. Pupils dropping litter and food. These are really unhealthy habits in normal circumstances and even more so now. There are inadequate numbers of cleaners, the depth of cleaning was already questionable and I feel that there would need to be much more regular cleaning between classes and much more thorough cleaning at the end of each day. There is often a lack of soap and hand towels in both pupil and staff toilets. I simply feel that schools are inherently insanitary places and should wetoo early, then any illness will spread extremely rapidly between pupils, to staff and they will take everything, then back to their families. Scared isn’t strong enough I’m highly vulnerable. I’m petried. They’ve been using my classroom as a base whilst I’ve been off, which seems crazy since there was every possible room except two that the staff are still in, and they used ours for the first three weeks. Social distancing cannot work in my room. I cannot separate my desks two metres apart. If I separate then cm, it will block access to the fire door. I am disabled and will not get around the room. Even then they are desks for two. I think I could have  children per day perhaps  How can I teach them without getting within  metres  To be honest even with  I don’t think I am far enough away, that just protects them from themselves. How can I mark their work without being contaminated  Our icy equipment is never cleaned. I always share it with  staff and the  kids, now every staff member had touched it. I have no ventilation except a fire door. Whatit is cold, or rains  If we don’t have assembly, I will have to plan and deliver those too. If we wish to prevent diner time spread, they will be asked to stay in the classroom to eat- I will have to supervise .Most of my children have hay fever. With the door open they all sneeze. How can I be safe  How can I eat We cannot social distance in the staff room and I’m too far to go home. Can’t even go to a cafe! We have  toilet cubicles for + staff, they cannot be kept clean and most definitely cannot be social distanced. We will almost all need to visit in the same  minutes, there is regularly a queue. I have to touch a touch screen to log in every day. It doesn’t work with gloves, I’ve tried. I walk with walking aids,I put them down they could become contaminated. I’m worried about breaking down on the way to work. Economy is being prioritised over peopleaposs health I am concerned that schools will open before it is safe to do so because the economy is being prioritised over peopleaposs health. I am concerned that students who come in coughing and unwell will not be sent home . I am also concerned that social distancing is not going to work with full class sizes. Dealing with student anxiety Bring a government guinea pig - how is social distancing possible in a school  Being held to account for achievement when pupils have had dferent levels of support during crisis. Quality of cleaning... in my current school student facilities were cleaned well but staff toilets were not. Dealing with student anxiety. Parents not sending students in so teaching half a class. How do you reach the others and whose responsibility is it  A co-ordinated plan needed for a possible second peak so we are ready and protected. The week before schools were closed in March was very stressful for staff left in school covering for absent colleagues. Will teachers be some of the first wave of people to get vaccine when andit becomes available   Teachers not given adequate time to replan curriculum to take into account inevitable learning gaps That it will happen too soon, and without proper consideration of the practical implications. Social distancing in schools is simply not possible, irrespective of what the government may believe. The government repeatedly state that CV is not dangerous for childrenand that they seem blind to the fact that many adults also work in schools. Teachers do not have access to PPE and risk catching the virus or taking it home to vulnerable members of their household. Schools may be told to increase cleaning routines, but will not be given the resourcesto actually do so. My school was filthy anyway due to repeated budget cuts and the subsequent paring down of cleaning staff. Disinfecting light switches and door handles twice a day is not going to fix the problem! Teachers will not be given adequate time to replan the curriculum to take into account the inevitable learning gaps and ied home learning experiences that will have resulted from lockdown, but will still be expected to magically close said gaps. Students in year  and year  will be seriously disadvantaged in next yearaposs exams. Schools will be understaffed due to continuing incidences of illness or self-isolation, increasing workload for those able to work.

The home may look teeny from the outside but step inside the front door and this unassuming home in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, hides an incredible secret. The cottage was the home of artist Antony Dracup, who spent years transforming it from a traditional terrace into something far more interesting. It boasts two bedrooms, a living room and a galley kitchen, perfect for family cooking. But walk further into the home and youaposll come to a massive sandstone cave, which comes complete with vaulted celings, ornate pillars and tile mosaics. And Antony didnapost stop there, he also created stunning landscaped gardens, a roof terrace, an attic room and a bathroom. Not only that but the determined artist completed many of his cave excavations by hand. His son, Dennis, explained: Every house that he took up residence in received the Dracup treatment – arches, pillars, balustrades, moulding, marbling, graining, nishing, stained-glass all designed and crafted from start to finish by his hand. In true Colditz style – a little every day, but persistently – he chiselled away. His persistence was rewarded with noticeably stronger chest muscles and extra living space.Antony died in  when he was  but he used the sandstone caves that are common in the area he lived in in Shropshire for his inspiration for the incredible adjustments to his home. The caves had previously been used as a place for young people to socialise but now form part of this unusual home. After moving into the home in the s, Antony worked tirelessly to transform it. The huge cave structure now makes up half the size of the property and he also levelled parts of the home to create ever bigger living spaces.But his first job was to sound-proof his house using an extra layer of bricks before he set about chiseling away at the cave that was originally in part of the garden. His son says on a website dedicated to his fatheraposs work: By way of a ladder it was possible to access the four levels of terracing, oddly and asymmetrically designed so as to fully involve the climber in the experience -you darenapost put a foot wrong here. Cast concrete, decorative features and moulding shared the daylight with lettuce, tomatoes an apple tree and much other edible produce. A vertical kitchen-garden which, to my fatheraposs delight, was once mistaken for a Roman Ruin in a local aerial survey.  Following Antonyaposs death all the subsequent owners have stayed true to his vision, keeping his stunning cave and all the intricate touches he had added.

Times were hard after the war, but I was happy. I had a warm, loving home and a close-knit family of Mum, Dad and Taid – my mum’s dad, who lived with us. I learned early on that’s all that mattered. We used to make do and mend. We wasted nothing. Sacrices were made every day. If my mum had three lamb chops, there would be one for me, one for Dad and one for Taid – and she’d go without, bless her.  Yet they still saved a little bit of money because they knew they would need it on a rainy day. I have watched with alarm as young people buy on the never-never and pay-later. They have these silly cards for everything. I don’t know how they balance everything at the end of the month. But for me, who was brought up to never even consider anything we couldn’t afford, I only buy something when I can hand over the cash. The thing is, even though young people need advice, they won’t listen.  When my mum advised me all those years ago, I just thought: “There’s Mum mithering on again.” I remember bending over to pick up pegs from a basket on the ground near the washing line, and Mum always said: “Be careful Val – you’re doing that all wrong and you’ll suffer later on”. I thought she was talking soft. And here I am, riddled with arthritis. I can hear myself talking like Mum to my own boys. She was wiser than I knew. The sooner we all realise our old mums were right, the better off we’ll all be.  Lockdown is getting harder because we’re running out of chat. My friend Beryl and I phone each other every day because she’s also on her own and we look out for each other. We live two doors away and I look out each morning to check her curtains are open so I know she’s up. If they’re not open by .am, I call her. Now, when I ask Beryl how she’s feeling, she says: “The same as yesterday”. For a long while in lockdown we laughed as we made up imaginary day trips. Beryl would say: “Where’s our taxi taking us today ”, and we’d talk about all the lovely seasides and cafes we’d visit. But now I say, ‘Don’t be silly Beryl –we’re not going anywhere for ages’. “Because evena taxi did pull up outside our houses, we’d be too scared to get in. We over-s with underlying health conditions have been locked down longer than anyone. And now we’ve got a new affliction: FOGO – fear of going out. So what do we talk about now  We enjoy a nice little moan. I do dream of going to Marks  Spencer though. My family has been wonderful at making sure I have everything I need. But I can’t ask my Robert to buy me knickers. He doesn’t understand my knickers. He’d be off buying me a thong.  And can you imagine me, with my arthritis in my legs, trying to get into a thong  EvenI could, I’m a big girl and would look like a sumo wrestler. Cheese-wire pants, that’s what I call thongs. No good to me at all. I wear Bridget Jones pants – the type that cover my back and keep it warm. Even I get confused in the underwear department - all this high leg, no VPL nonsense. I want full briefs and that’s the end of it.  My daughters-in-law could probably talk me through buying them online, but I need to see knickers, feel nighties and check every little bit of a dressing gown so I know it’s comfy and will wash. I have asked a lot of my family lately but I think this would be asking too much. Rod Stewart says he’s glad people have fallen in love with his music now rather than his sexy image in the s. He’s right. I became a fan when he sang the big band tunes a few years back. But him in the s, with those silly leopard-print leggings and hair like our Robert’s – well, he looked a sight! I’m addicted to watching Real Housewives of Cheshire. I like to see how the women live and how they manage not to get thrown out of restaurants when they act up. I love spotting the cafes Robbie’s taken me to near his home. Exercise Unlimited exercise outdoors is to be allowed, with the previous aposonce-a-dayapos rule scrapped Sunbathing People will be allowed to sit on parks and beaches, provided they stay two metres away from other people Drive Boris Johnson said in his speech on Sunday night that people will be able to drive to other destinations from Wednesday, presumably to exercise there, although more detailed plans are likely to follow Meet others From May , people will be able to meet one friend or relative from a dferent household in a public place, provided they stay two metres apart. Gatherings of more than two people remain banned, so people cannot meet both their parents, for example Play golf and tennis Golf courses and tennis courts will reopen from May , with social distancing relatively easy to achieve, although you can play only with people in your household. Team sports such as football are not likely to be encouraged, as social distancing is dficult and more people than the average household would be required Fishing and swimming Angling and water sports are also to be allowed to resume in England from Wednesday. Again, you must be within your own household and two metres from other people Return to work Rather than a change to the rules, the government is now encouraging people toto workthey cannot do so from home. But they also urge people to drive, walk or cycle to work rather than use public transport,possible But sometimes when I was there I looked around at the very glammed-up women around Alderley Edge and thought: all fur coat and no knickers. You are what you are, there’s no point trying to be someone you’re not. All the lip filler, pouting and boob jobs. I can’t be doing with it. Robbie’s we Sarah is nothing like that. She is pure class. She could wear a bin bag and look fantastic. Sarah said she just wanted to be a normal we and mother, so while lots of other wives had nannies for their kids she didn’t agree with it. I’ve met a lot of footballers’ wives over the years, but not the very famous ones because our Robbie didn’t play for any major teams, bless him. It doesn’t matter to me what they looked like or what designer clothes they had, justthey were a nice person. Maybe now the hairdressers and beauty therapists are closed during lockdown we might all realise that’s far more important. For the last three Sundays on the trot, my neighbour Mia has delivered me a lovely full Sunday roast on a tray, complete with a gravy boat and pudding. I used to always cook Sunday dinners for my parents, husband and boys. But now I’m on my own, I can’t be doing with cooking meat, peeling potatoes and steaming sprouts for myself. Having such a lovely dinner again meant an awful lot to me.

Meanwhile, others who had already booked a holiday are suffering refund rage, as travel firms and airlines drag their heels when it comes to handing money back for trips and flights cancelled due to Covid-. Here we spell out what you need to know, and where you stand. What will the new quarantine measures mean for my holiday The Government says it plans to introduce a -day quarantine for travellers ing to the UK, but has notgiven clear details of when it will be introduced or how.The Foreign Office advises against all but essential travel abroad. Any quarantine measures introduced while this advice remains will make little dference to the vast majority of holidaymakers whose holidays have been cancelled due to these restrictions. What does the current travel advice mean for future travel, like my summer holiday booking  Each company will have their own processes for managing future departures and should be contacting customers due to travel imminently. There is no legal definition of “imminent travel”, although it is generally considered to be within a few days. The Association of British Travel Agents is advising people with future bookings to be patient and wait to be contacted by their travel provider. What are my options for postponing a trip  Many travel companies and airlines are offering more flexible booking policies at this time, such as giving customers the option to change their travel date should they wish to postpone their holiday. ABTA says, however, that “in certain circumstances” this may not be possible. I’ve booked a summer holiday, should I cancel it No, while the FCO is warning against travel abroad, and the UK’s quarantine means most holidays can’t takeplace this summer, it’s important you don’t cancel.Consumer group Which  says wait for the holiday company or airline to cancel, so you can claim a full refund.  Instead of giving me my money back I’ve been offered a credit note. Is this legal and can I demand a refund  Many firms are offering refund credit notes or vouchers. Ashlee Robinson, associate at DAS Law, says you are not obliged to accept it, and entitled to receive a full refund which should be provided within  days. But, under the current circumstances, it may be reasonable to allow more time. WhatI haven’t paid for the holiday in full yet  If the holiday is likely to be cancelled you shouldn’t be expected to make the full payment, only for you to be refunded shortly after. However, Ashlee saysthe holiday is a few months away and you have contractual commitments, you may be liable to pay or risk losing your deposit. Contact the firm to negotiate delaying the payment. If you do pay, it is advisable to do so by credit card to give you more protection.  What rights do I havethe travel firm goes bust Your money should be protected and details of making a claimshould be laid out in the ATOL certicate, which you generally get when you book.Also,you paid by credit card and the holiday cost more than £ you may be able to claim under section  of the Consumer Credit Act . Is coronavirus covered by my travel insurance That will depend on when youtook the policy out and the level of cover you purchased. Check the small print.Which  says try and get a refund from your travel or accommodation provider first. Insurance will only pay out for costs that cannot be refunded.

Feroza Younis Omar volunteered to feed the babies left without their mothers in the attack on the Doctors Without Borders maternity unit in the Afghan capital, in which  died. A powerful photograph captures the woman, who has her own -month-old baby, breastfeeding another infant at the hospital which militants stormed earlier this week in an attack that shocked the world. The woman, who works at the countryaposs Economic Ministry, said: “All of us have been damaged by criminals who are destroying humanity in Afghanistan. I am one of those.” Three gunmen dressed as police officers stormed the maternity hospital in the Afghan capital on Tuesday morning. They threw grenades before opening fire on hospital workers, mothers and newborn babies. Khadija, one of the few survivors of the attack, revealed that she had been forced to wait to hug her newborn son for the first time as the armed group stormed the unit just hours after she gave birth. She said the intensive care ward had been full of smoke and bullets but both she and her son survived, with Khadija herself having to hide under a table to avoid the bullets.  No group has so far claimed the attack, but the countryaposs president Ashraf Ghani has blamed the Taliban and asked the military to step up operations against the group. However the United States has blamed Islamic State militants — not the Taliban — for the gruesome hospital attack that killed two newborn babies. It renewed calls for Afghans to embrace a troubled peace push with the Taliban insurgency. The attackers were eventually killed in a y operation by the Afghan security forces.Following the attack, at least twenty newborns were left without caretakers and were transferred to the Ataturk Hospital in the Afghan capital, Kabul. The hospitalaposs head doctor Jannat Gul Askarzada told reporters: “Twenty babies have been brought to Ataturk Hospital. One of them was sent to the children’s health hospital for orthopedic treatment.”As the news hit the headlines in Afghanistan, many people praised the mother on Twitter for her efforts and a hashtag bearing her name went viral.Masoom Musakhail tweeted: “That is the Humanity to feed the baby of martyred Mothers.” "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.42725802-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.42725802-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.42725802-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.42725802-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"coronavirus live the key updates on may 15","story":"Keep up with the latest updates as the coronavirus pandemic continues throughout Scotland and the UK.Reporters from across the DCT Media titles will keep you up to date with the latest closures, cancellations, health information and more.We’ll bring you all of the news as it happens throughout the day:The Tele is Dundee Born and Read, and is committed to providing news to our communities.Right now that’s more important than ever, which is why our key content is free.You can chose to support us and access premium content by subscribing to the Eveningfrom just £. a month."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/05/727898-1-505x564.jpg ","title":"dundee fc foreign legion scottish steel barry smith","story":"Dundee legend Barry Smith has lted the lid on how he adapted to the Bonettis’ “off-the-cuff” approach to le at Dens Park.It’s  years since the managerial duo of enigmatic brothers, Ivano and Dario, arrived to take charge at the Dark Blues.Having played under some of the biggest names at the biggest Italian clubs, challenging for league titles and European trophies, the pair arrived with a burgeoning contacts book and plenty of ambition.An influx of foreign players followed, with Claudio Caniggia, Juan Sara, Fabian Caballero, Marco de Marchi and Georgi Nemsadze arriving in the first year.The second saw the likes of Temuri Ketsbaia, Julian Speroni and Fan Zhiyi come in.The excess that funded all of these big names eventually caught up with the club as they failed to sell them on and administration beckoned a year after the Bonettis departed.Prior to their appointment, the Dark Blues had enjoyed a positive campaign under Jocky Scott.But huge changes lay ahead and former club captain and manager Smith knew he had two options – leave or get with the programme.He said: “There was probably a mix of anticipation and trepidation among the players, we really just didn’t know what to expect.“We had a good squad when they came in, we had finished a point off fth under Jocky Scott but the first day back in pre-season there were a few new faces around.“I always said thatyou think your face doesn’t fit then it’s up to you to make it fit. My plan was to work as hard as I could to be part of the team.“If they wanted things done a certain way then I was going to do that to the best of my ability thenit doesn’t work out, I’ve done all I can.“There were big changes to training but going away for three weeks in pre-season to Italy was a big one. Usually you’d only be away for a week but this was a long time.“They did lay everything that was to happen out in front of you, though. However, there was a strict menu on offer –you didn’t like it, you’d go hungry.”Training too was completely dferent as Dundee adopted a football strategy that had served the Bonetti brothers in their homeland.As a future coach and boss, Smith says he learned a lot during their time in the City of Discovery, evensome elements of their approach were dficult to get to grips with.“The way they structured training was completely dferent as well but dferent managers all have dferent views,” he added.“Training would change time but we’d train every day and there were a few double sessions.“They relied on doing the same thing rigidly over and over so you knew what you were getting and there was very little change.“I have to say I learned a lot about working on shape and positional play. Previous managers had done shape but not to the extent the Bonettis worked on it.“Training could be a bit off-the-cuff sometimes. They were obviously new to coaching themselves and learning as they went.”There were high-profile disagreements as foreign signings kept Scottish players out of the starting XI.The Bonetti brothers’ volatile nature also led to fall outs behind the scenes, but Smith focused on working hard in training and reaping the rewards.“I always treat people as they treat me and the Bonettis treated me very well,” he said.“I’m not saying they did that with every player – there were definitely a few not treated as well as they should have been.“I played with players I never expected to line up alongside at Dundee. Georgi Nemsadze was wonderful, Claudio Caniggia was a top talent, but they also needed the Scottish guys like myself, Gav Rae, Steven Tweed and Willie Falconer to make the core of the team.“I don’t think the foreign guys really understood Scottish football or knew what to expect.“We all just got our heads down and knuckled down to work. I think the Bonettis appreciated that.“They were good times and I’m sure the fans wouldn’t change seeing those players in dark blue even with what happened afterwards in administration.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.42725802-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.42725802-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.42725802-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.42725802-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"dundee united johnny russell transfer news","story":"Ex-Dundee United star Johnny Russell is open to ato Tannadice.Russell is back in training with MLS side Sporting Kansas City, with whom he has established himself as a fan-favourite.But while he is loving le in the States, Russell is not against the idea of finishing his playing career back where it started.“I had a great relationship with the fans – hopefully at some point I will maybe get the chance to get myself there,” Russell said of United to the BBC.“I wouldn’t say I have got a desire to come back – I love it where I am – but I would never turn my nose up to come back and play in Scotland.”Russell spent five successful years with Derby County after leaving United in .His subsequent move to the US, aged just , came as a shock.But his red hot MLS form has led to continued Scotland recognition – and paved the way for former United man Gary Mackay-Steven and ex-Celtic kid Lewis Morgan to join him in the States.For Russell, success in America has vindicated his leap of faith.“I said at the time that I felt it was the right decision.

If you had to have them it would be in a final, but the draw was kind to us with Raith.“They’d been doing well under John McGlynn but it gave us an opportunity to go to Hampden.“One of the things that sticks in my mind is we had the Sunday game but on Saturday, Ross County were playing Celtic.“We were going to the Westerwood Hotel in Cumbernauld to stay overnight.“We’d trained at Tannadice and headed down. I was off to Falkirk to watch them play St Mirren but Gary Kirk and Paul Hegarty went with the team on the bus.“I was listening to the radio all the way and about half-way down Ross County went one-up.“By the time I’m in the car park at Falkirk, Ross County score again with minutes to go to make it - and it really hit me then.“That was the first time I thought to myself, ‘There’s only three teams left and we’re now the favourites for the cup’.“I felt a bit of pressure going into the Raith Rovers game that we had to go out and do our business.“We were nervous but, thankfully, I had a group of players behind me who were magnicent and we beat Raith comfortably after a slow -minute start.”Although they were indeed favourites at that stage to go on and lt the cup, Houston insists that wasn’t always the case.The -year-old believes the Tangerines still had to do it the hard way in beating Partick, St Johnstone and champions Rangers after a replay to get their shot at Hampden glory.He continues: “A lot of people say Dundee United had it easy because we played Ross County in the final but they forget about the journey.“The fact is we had an away game at Partick Thistle then we were away to Premier League St Johnstone in the next round. That’s never an easy fixture.“We went down there and I remember Gary’s father had died during that week.“The players decided they wanted to wear black armbands and dedicated the win to Bobby Kirk, who was an ex-Hearts league and cup winner way back.“It was a nice gesture for the players, that’s the type of boys they were.“We went to Ibrox after that to play a strong Rangers side, who were the champions.“That was three in a row away from home in the Scottish Cup so we didn’t have an easy draw.“We were - down after Rangers got a couple of penalties, the usual at Ibrox, but to our credit we scored goals.“To see Andis Shala and Mihael Kovacevic on the scoresheet was something unusual. We got a wee break as well with wee Morgaro Gomis’ volley being deflected in.“They thought the game was won at -. They had downed tools a bit and the crowd was away to miss the traffic.“That set us up for our only home tie, the replay at Tannadice. That was a memorable game for the supporters.“The treble-buster, as he calls himself, David Robertson scored with his backside in the last minute.“That was the best thing for us because there wasn’t much time for Rangers to go and put up a comeback.“We were the better team and deserved to win.”United would see off Ross County in the final thanks to a second-half strike from David Goodwillie and a Craig Conway double.Nearly , Arabs rejoiced in watching on as Houston  Co climbed the steps to lt the Scottish Cup for the first time since .He continues: “It hits you when you’re walking out prior to kick-off and it’s just a sea of tangerine.“There were , Arabs there and that was a sight to behold. It’s so colourful.“A lot of people thought it wouldn’t be a good atmosphere because it was Dundee United and a smaller club like Ross County but to be fair to them I think Dingwall emptied for that day.“It was a busy final and the pressure was on us that we should win this cup.“There’s an added pressure there because you’re desperately keen to not mess it up for the fans.“The Saturday night and Sunday celebrations at Tannadice and City Square were amazing.“It’s something you can’t take away from that group of players and it will never leave my memory.”The celebrations would go on for days after but it is only now Houston looks back at their win as greatness achieved not bestowed.He credits predecessor Craig Levein for laying the foundations and admits there is a special sense of pride at achieving Scottish Cup glory, something the man who started it all, Jim McLean, couldn’t do.“As you get older you start asking yourself, ‘Where did those  years go to ’” he says.“It brought joy to a lot of United fans who’d only seen them win it once prior with Ivan Golac.“It felt surreal that Jim, who was the best manager of them all, hadn’t been able to get it over line with the amount of times he took United to Scottish Cup Finals.“It was great for me, personally, being the manager of United then and doing that.“The big thing for me was we had a brilliant group of players.“Craig and I had went in a few years before and he deserves credit as well. Him and I worked really hard building a new squad.“We were bottom of the league when we went in back in . Wee Eddie Thompson’s only words to Craig and I were, ‘Just keep my team in the top ision’.“We managed to finish ninth that season then fth for the next couple of years.“I was delighted that when I took over and Craig went away to be the Scotland manager we finished third, won the cup and went into Europe three years in a row.“It had been a long time for the club since it had been on that stage and they haven’t been since.“A lot of people forget that, yes we won the Scottish Cup, but we finished third behind a very strong Rangers and Celtic, and nine points ahead of Hibs.“It was a magnicent achievement and turned out a wonderful season.”Dundee United#s Scottish Cup-winning boss Peter Houston hopes Robbie Neilson can lead Terrors to Hampden triumph\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-peter-houston-robbie-neilson embed # secretIXeWqxySKj\" data-secret\"IXeWqxySKj\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53240131-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53240131-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53240131-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53240131-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"revealed dario bonetti kicked rugby park","story":"The Bonetti era at Dundee didn’t throw up many dull moments – and Kilmarnock fans will certainly remember the night assistant Dario entertained them in the stands at Rugby Park.A combination of a car accident, a paperwork error and Bonetti missing a Killie goal saw Ayrshire fans that night experience both sides of the charismatic and, at times, volatile Italian.With no place on the bench for Dark Blues assistant manager, Dario watched the game from the press box behind the home supporters in the main stand.The Evening ’s former senior football writer, Tom Duthie, had a front-row seat to the spectacle.He said: “Most of the squad had travelled the night before the game, but Dario Bonetti was heading west on the Saturday.“Unfortunately an accident blocked the main road between Glasgow and Kilmarnock and along with most fans, and press, Dario did not arrive at Rugby Park in time for kick off.“When he got there he found his name had not been included on the official list of those in the Dundee technical area and, for once, the assistant manager had to head for the stand to observe the action.“Along with full-back Marcello Marrocco, who was injured, he decided to join us in the press box at the back of the main stand.“Given that the stand is for home fans, it crossed my mind this could lead to problems because I knew there was no way the passionate Italian would stay quiet. He didn#t.“But as well as kicking every ball for his team, big Dario also engaged with the punters sitting nearby and gave them what must have been one of their most entertaining match experiences ever.“Unfortunately for Dario his late arrival meant he missed an opening goal for Killie and although Dundee equalised before the break he was still unaware of it as he headed for the dressing-room at half-time.“There were some confused players in there as he blasted them and told them they were lucky to be ahead.“When he repeated that opinion on retaking his seat for the second-half I can remember a couple of awkward minutes as Marrocco, Dundee#s press officer Niall Scott and I discussed who should be the one to tell him the correct score.“I escaped that dangerous task by pointing out I was not a club employee and they were.“If memory serves me, it was Marrocco who broke the news, to be met with an eruption from his assistant gaffer.“I should add that outside of game time, Dario was as charming as his brother.“In their first season together the pair steered Dundee to a top six finish and produced a team capable of playing football that was as pleasing on the eye as anything theof the country.“As their second season progressed, however, Ivano was making increasingly frequent trips back to Italy and it was clear all was not well behind the scenes.“It came as no surprise when he was replaced by Jim Duffy in the summer of  and in just over another year the extent of the club#s spending during the Bonetti experiment became clear as it plunged into administration and was on the brink of extinction.“For all that, Dundee fans understandably remember those two years with great fondness, as do press men like myself who experienced a time the like of which is highly unlikely to be seen again.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"jiving-gis-glasgows-george-square---ve-day-memories","story":"BONFIRES so hot they cracked tenement windows.

He was quiet, but had a way about, a really good character and integrated with the boys.“Him and Eoin Jess during my time in Aberdeen were at a dferent level from everybody  in terms of what they could do.“Arild was dferent in that he was just a natural goalscorer, but I don’t even think he liked football.“He actually said at one point ‘I don’t enjoy playing football, I just do it for the money’ and I was blown away.“He said ‘I think I want to write my own book or go into coaching. I think I’d prefer to do that.’McNaughton went on to explain, although Stavrum#s workrate wasn#t the highest, he was the type of talent who would #do nothing for  minutes and score two goals#.Injury and a less warm relationship with Paterson during Pele#s year-and-a-half at Pittodrie saw #Super Kev# making fewer Aberdeen starts, before his final two seasons under Calderwood, where he was once again a mainstay of the team.McNaughton revealed he thinks Calderwood#s tendency to chop and change his team and the lack of a domestic cup run were his downfall, despite top-six finishes and # after McNaughton#s departure # a fantastic run in the UEFA Cup which included meetings with Atletico Madrid, Lokomotiv Moscow, Copenhagen and Bayern Munich.In the episode of Northern Goal, which is available on your favourite podcast app, McNaughton also reveals the real story of his Dons departure, his reflections on owner Vincent Tan, FA Cup and League Cup losses in his time at Cardf City, as well as counting the likes of Aaron Ramsey, Craig Bellamy and Robbie Fowler as team-mates.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 11 coronavirus and the masters","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of other things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre.This week we discuss the effect of the Corona virus  on the tours, Steevie#s discovery of old golf clubs which he hopes might make him his fortune, Rangefinders and other golf tech and we take a quick visit to the old course in St. AndrewsAn entertaining listen which you can download for freePlay or download the episode in the link below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyll rallyers in inverness action","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe opening round of the  KNC Groundworks Scottish Rally Championships took place in and around Inverness last weekend with a good entry of  cars.The event, on Saturday March , was three weeks later than usual to try and avoid the worst of the weather. There were, however, large sections of the stages still swathed in snow and ice, making conditions changeable to say the least.Lochgilphead#s Alister MacArthur was back in the forests, after a two-and-a-half year break, in the MR Motorsport prepared Talbot Sunbeam. Co-driver Claire Tilley, from Craignure, Mull, had only completed one event prior to this in the car and that was on tarmacadam and mostly in the dark of Mull Rally. Gravel, snow and ice would be a whole dferent concept in the powerful rear wheel drive car.The car has seen development over the past season and the five stages ahead that day would be as much a test as a genuine attempt to score points.However, after a relatively clean run through the  miles of Stage  # the stage that claimed a large number of competitors due to the slippy conditions # thoughts quickly turned to getting up the leaderboard and grabbing as many championship points as possible.The crew had made it to the afternoon sitting in th place overall and a very quick run through Stage  saw them climb to st. Drama nearly robbed them of a great result when the alternator stopped working and the battery started to go flat in the last  miles of Lochletter , with Alister switching off all but the bare essential electric components to try and make it to the finish. Finish they did and in nd place overall and third in Class . A brilliant start to the new season.Also heading north to Inverness to compete was Ian Parker, whose normal seat in the MkII had been withdrawn as the car wasn#t ready. He had a late call to co-drive for Linzi Henderson in her Ford Fiesta but they were one of the unlucky crews to slide off the road in Stage , only a mile from the start, spectacularly attempting to knock down some trees in the process.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was out in the Subaru Impreza of Graeme Sherry in what is slowly becoming a weekend habit # one which has his mother watching nervously from the wings. They had a good day and brought the car home in th overall and eighth in a competitive Class . They plan to do the full season, so watch this space for updates on their progress.The closely contested event was finally won by Michael Binnie and Clare Mole in a Mitsubishi Evo, with the ever present Jock Armstrong and Cameron Fair taking second place in the TEG Sport Impreza, after leading the rally for much of the day. Freddie Milne and Patrick Walsh in the Fiesta R were third overall.Next up is the Speyside Rally in Elgin on April ."},{"url":null,"title":"soccer centre has its finger on the pulse","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Soccer Centre volunteers have received vital first aid training.Sports clubs are required to ensure a number of their volunteers have a valid first aid certicate and when Lochgilphead Soccer Centre looked to secure the services of an accredited firm to provide the required two-day course, outdoor and first aid coach Andy Craven was happy to help.Covering theory and practice of all fundamental aspects of first aid, the volunteers were grateful to Andy for his informative and interactive approach to learning important skills and knowledge to safeguard the welfare of players and spectators.Soccer Centre chairman Stuart Green  said: #It is not just about having the relevant certicate, but ensuring a good number of our volunteers have the knowledge, skills and equipment to look after our youngsters and their friends and families.#Knocks and sprains are common in football and we deal with them every week, however, even as volunteers, we have an obligation to be prepared with any eventuality and Andy was first class in guiding our volunteers through a range of scenarios.#Andy said: #Whilst first aid is a serious business, the folks at Lochgilphed Soccer Centre were a great bunch.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe join our communities in applauding the people at the sharp end of the coronavirus outbreak.In this time of crisis, we have nothing but admiration for frontline health, care and other local authority staff # and even management # who are having to deal with the virus close-up.Let#s not forget everyone  working on for the benefit of our society, from shop workers to lorry drivers and the emergency services # and many more besides.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

The beauty and calm of the island made a lasting impression on me.#The monuments of Kilmartin Glen are also at the very heart of the book’s major themes, including kingship and the sacredness of landscape.#And it was at Dunadd that Aidan would have seen the kings of Dál RiataPortals to this other-world still survive, suggested by mountains, forgotten ruins, holy wells and standing stones, crosses and caves, said Mr Connell.Born in Newcastle, he now lives in Cumbria, England, with his partner and their daughter.He previously worked for titles including The Edinburgh Evening News, with bylines in The Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday.The book has been published by Culture and Democracy Press and is available to purchase online through Amazon for £."},{"url":null,"title":"national theatre announces new digital programming","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe National Theatre has announced the next two productions to be streamed live on YouTube every Thursday at pm.The screenings are part of National Theatre at Home the new initiative to bring content to the public accessed from their homes during coronavirus.Productions announced today include the NT Live broadcast of Danny Boyle’s production of Frankenstein filmed at the National Theatre in , which sees Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller alternating the roles of Victor Frankenstein and his creation.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

Harbour seal pups shed their whitecoat in the womb before being born and so can be in the water and swim almost straight from birth. Females need to give birth on land though.ldquoGrey seal pups are born with the white lunugo fur and have to stay on land much more until they moult this off around three weeks after giving birth.He saidanyone spots a seal entangled in material such as fishing gear, they should contact British Divers Marine Le Rescuebdmlr.org.uk index.php, which has trained people in East Lothian who will try to capture and free the seal.Mr Malone, who studied zoology at University of Glasgow, has been through this training and has had to aid hundreds of seals all over the world.He was delighted to capture on camera a large group of around  seals, some pregnant, near the Musselburgh lagoons while out for his daily exercise on a cycle from his Edinburgh home.They were hauled out on exposed rocks, just offshore and past the lagoons, heading towards Prestonpans.Mr Malone said: ldquoHarbour seal numbers have actually been in quite drastic decline around Scotland, especially on the east coast, so it was good to see this big group of them.ldquoI am a bit of a fan of seals, having worked on numerous projects on them. This included a project at University of St Andrews where we were looking at the diet of both harbour and grey seals all around Scotland.He now runs his own environmental education organisation, Wildside Nature, which offers workshops and projects to all stages of learners, designed to bring real le science and nature experiences to students.He said: ldquoI use my background as a zoologist to deliver fun, active and engaging workshops on a wide iety of wildle subjects.ldquoI have run workshops in schools and nurseries all over East Lothian including both the Burgh and Loretto RC Primary Schools in Musselburgh and Law Primary School at North Berwick.ldquoI also run sessions at many other schools, nurseries and even with elderly groups all around Scotland and the north of England.Mr Malone is continuing to support childrenrsquos distance learning during the Covid- lockdown.He said: ldquoI have been making activities that people can do at home to help them connect with nature during the current period.ldquoThis has included making bird food from kitchen waste and putting out material that birds will use for nesting material.

This year the figure fell to less than  per cent.The council also refuses to allow children whose parents opt to keep them home and fund the nursery place themselves to remain in school nurseries.Parents who decide to pay for an additional year of nursery themselves to keep their children out for a year face bills of up to pound, and a hunt for alternative child care places.Another mum who was refused funding said she had initially been supported in her view that her child was too immature to start school by her nursery.But they withdrew that support after pressure from the councilrsquos education department, she said.ldquoThey were told that they couldnrsquot support us because we didnrsquot meet the council policy criteria and withdrew their support, she explained.ldquoOur views meant nothing and the impact on our child meant nothing.And other parents expressed fears that their children were being robbed of nursery experience because they have been in lockdown for some of the vital months they would have had and would have no transition into school.One mum said: Children who start school at -years-old already receive a year less nursery time than those who are older, that has been reduced further by the closure of nurseries.ldquoHow can we ask these young children to go from months at home with their family to suddenly starting primary one with no transition A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: ldquoconfirmed they have now agreed to approve all deferral requests for the year ahead.They said: ldquoAs a result of the ongoing closure of schools and nurseries, we have been reviewing applications for deferred entry to P, ahead of session  . Due to the current situation, applications for deferred entry and a further funded year have now been approved.

I wanted to bring culture into peoplersquos living rooms and to have a sense of everybody doing it at the same time, because one of the things that has been happening a lot is that people have been pre-recording these cultural experiences and sometimes they can seem dead on arrival ndash but I wanted this to feel very live.Beginning on Thursday at pm, Kay will launch this series of online literary and musical performances, produced by the National Theatre of Scotland and streamed on its YouTube channel. In its mix will be not only readings and singing, but conversation about art and poetry, as well as the strange times we are going through and the struggles they bring. Kay, who will host, hopes they will offer ldquofood for the soul.Having lost her father, pre-lockdown, and struggled with not being able to see her mother who is in a care home, she acknowledges that, like many, she has found these times hard. ldquoIrsquove been traumatised by lots of things. The last time I saw my mum I had to persuade the home to let me in just to say goodbye. Hers was one of the first homes in the country to go into lockdown, on March , and though at the time it felt shocking it was definitely a wise move. I know two homes, near hers, that have had many die just in the last few days. Itrsquos terrying. I find it worse, this situation, having my mum in the home at this time, than my dad dying. I know that loss canrsquot really be measured in scales butI had to say what was the most dficult experience I would definitely say this is the most dficult experience ever.One of the things Kay want to do is ldquoaccompany people through these times. That accompanying is partly what we have a Makar for. Itrsquos one of the reasons we turn to poets, singers and artists. In times like these we need such voices. ldquoI feel itrsquos important, now, to accompany people, she says, ldquobecause I think that this particular crisis has turned the volume up. Kind people have got kinder, anxious people more anxious. Itrsquos showed the huge problems we have in our society already. Poor people are more likely to die quicker of this virus, BAME people are more likely to die quicker ndash so I just wanted to create something that takes note of our time but also offers something up to them.The series is curated by Kay and produced by the National Theatre of Scotland in association with HOME Manchester and Edinburgh International Book Festival and School of Arts and Media, Salford. The writers and musicians are being paid in an attempt to support artists during this dficult period. The commitment to the four-month stretch of the series is also an acknowledgement that we will not be ing to social gathering, theatre-going and the live arts experience any time soon. Most of the summerrsquos live events, including Edinburghs festivals, are already cancelled.ldquoI think, says Kay, ldquoeven when people start trying to put their heads out of the door, theyrsquoll want to pull their head right back in. People are not going to gather publicly for some time. I donrsquot think theatres are going to be open till January next year, at the earliest, and even when things do open, people will be wary about gathering in public groups.Many artists, she observes, are shting to trying to deliver their work online ndash and this may be increasingly the way of the future. ldquoWe all needed to be travelling less, flying less, and so perhaps some of these new formats are new formats for our times and point the way to cleaner air.Makar To Makar will be part of the flowering of creativity that has already been happening online. ldquoWe know,\" says Kay, \"from reading about all dferent crises throughout time, that people will turn to poetry and music. During the siege of Sarajevo, they had years of no water, no electricity, very little proper food, bombs going off, but they still managed to erect these theatres and people still managed to come out and see shows.\"The Covid- crisis, she notes, ldquohas been musicrsquos defining hour\". ldquoPeople have been touched by things like the Italians singing on their balcony.But whats missing with much online art is that sense of us all coming together in a moment of time, as we would around a live event. This is what Kay hopes to create. ldquoRight now wersquove lost our communality because wersquore not able to do communal things together, like go out and eat together or go to the theatre together, and it seems to me this is one way of bringing the communal back.\" What she wants, she says is to give people ldquosomething stimulating, hopeful, thought-provoking, funny, sad, a whole range of things ndash and that people will get a chance to experience it all together."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-inspiration-helped-scots-chef-reach-final-great-british-menu","story":"Drawing on a scene from one of her favourite books Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Edinburgh-based chef Roberta Hall-McCarron made her way into the last week of the Great British Menu after winning the Scottish heat of the BBC show.This year chefs are competing to earn a place to present a dish at a banquet to celebrate childrenrsquos literature and for Mrs Hall-McCarron, chef and owner of The Little Chartroom, the menu brief could not have been better.ldquoThere have been some amazing banquet themes over the years of this competition, but when I learned this yearrsquos was childrenrsquos literature, I think we have the best yet, said Mrs Hall-McCarron.ldquoAs a young adult I remember reading the Harry Potter novels and the Goblet of Fire stood out for me.

This virus took everyone by surprise by its virulence and contagiousness. It moved at such a pace that government departments and agencies for a long time could only play catch-up. In such a hectic and confused atmosphere, mistakes were made and vital decisions delayed, but that would have been the case no matter who was in charge. You only have to re-read newspapers back in January to see that little attention was being paid to the impending crisis by anyone.Yes, at the end of this hold an inquiry as to what went wrong and in doing so learn lessons and plan for the future. But let us not allow it to be used by politicians for cheap political point-scoring and others to pursue their own grievance and blame culture agenda ndash something that appears to be gaining momentum now.If we fail to learn those important lessons, then at some time in the future history will repeat itself. Now is not the time to look back at what might have been. Decisions were taken at the time in conjunction with the medical evidence available at the time. At this time we can only come through this crisis by putting dferences and grievances aside and working together. Yes, questions can be raised but once a decision has been made, we should get behind it and take responsibility by whatever means and however small a contribution to make it work.Paul Lewis, Edinburgh EH.EVEN before the present lockdown, the basic facts about Covid- were known it is a viral respiratory disease, spread by contact and through aerosol, which poses little or no risk to the young and healthy, but is extremely dangerous to sections of the older population particularly those with underlying health conditions.These basic facts can readily be understood by any Scot, and together with the simple procedures for reducing transmission ndash hand washing and distancing where necessaryndash can be, and were, imparted through education early in the outbreak. Beyond this the outstanding public health responsibly of the Scottish Government was to identy and shelter the most vulnerable section of society for example, those in care homes, from the disease, concentrating scarce testing and PPE resources on this problem. It is now apparent that this was not done effectively.Instead attention became focused on using draconian laws to enforce an ill-advised blanket lockdown on society and the economy to suppress the natural epidemic. This has been implemented through the use of mindless slogans ndash Stay Home, Save the NHS ndash of the type normally associated with control of the population by totalitarian states. Groundless fear has been engendered in the Scottish population, especially the vast majority that are at very low risk, through Government briefings that concentrate on numbers of dead taken completely out of context. This has been employed as a tool to micromanage the behaviour of Scots using a set of arbitrary rules that have little or no scientic basis. All trust in the pragmatic common sense of Scots to assess risk and mody behaviour as a result of Covid- has been lost.Meanwhile the timorous Scottish Government shelters behind its computer screens, frightened into inaction by its own flawed propaganda and ignorance of risk, and in denial at the enormous economic, educational and cultural damage that its myopic focus on Covid- suppression is causing. The time has come for the Scottish Government to admit past mistakes, pluck up its courage and lead us out of this grotesque lockdown so that we can live in a Scotland where risk is present but pragmatically managed, and our economy, education, culture and inidualism can thrive.Professor Richard Ennos, Edinburgh EH.NICOLA Sturgeon has extended the lockdown in Scotland until May . Fine and good, Stay at Home.However, wersquove had eight weeks of lockdown to figure out how we are going to exit lockdown, but all wersquove seen is meaningless framework document that says nothing. What happened to the adult conversations Surely itrsquos now time for the First Minister to tell us how,not when, we are going to exit lockdown. Many countries are already well advanced in their easing of lockdown conditions but we in Scotland have not been given one iota of information. We are not even being told when such a plan will be announced, far less seeing a plan.It is two weeks to May , and therefore  weeks to plan, so surely we are due to see a plan for exiting this lockdown, or is the plan to Stay at Home Forever  We really need to be told before the publicrsquos patience and goodwill disappears.Ian McNair, Cellardyke.IN recent days the First Minister sensibly extended the lockdown in Scotland. However,she thinks that it is working she is sadly deluded.Road traffic is getting heavier and faster by the day and there seems to be little or no enforcement of the restrictions which became law at the start of the outbreak of Covid.It appears from reports that most or all other countries in Europe are supporting lockdown by enforcement but there is little evidence of that happening here.Some countries have issued tens of thousands of fines and made millions of stops but police here seem to be reluctant, why Surely the First Ministerrsquos daily pleas and those of us who are playing the game deserve support from those who have the power to do so Bill MacIntyre, East Kilbride.IT seems that some folk believe that,no visitors or family are allowed in, a care home is an easy place to ensure that the virus cannot enter and spread. Nothing could be further from the truth.I am not connected in any way to any care home, except as a visitor to an elderly friend with dementia, who recently died after testing positive. She was a lovely, kind, caring person, but dementia had made her very stubborn and sometimes dficult to persuade to do as was requested of her or forgetting what she was told within minutes. I know that it became well-nigh impossible to make her, and many others in the same position, stay in their own room. Short of having one member of staff allocated   to each of these residents, it was simply impossible, however hard staff tried.Then there are logistics to consider. Food must be delivered, laundry picked up and delivered and so on, while staff have tohome once a sht is over and be with close family, possibly having to shop, do washing for an elderly relative and other close contact tasks. However careful the precautions, it is a close-contact situation where perfect protection against transmission is impossible, in fact perhaps one of the most dficult to control.Remember too, that the residents would in almost all cases not be there unless they had the underlying conditions of multiple, progressive, health problems as well as the age factor, making them more vulnerable. I personally admire the hard work and dedication of their unappreciated and underpaid carers.Perhaps it would be better to consider how much more dficult a crisis like this is because of the profit motive of private care-home providers who build as many tiny rooms as can possibly be fitted into the size of the site. Dficult to isolate and avoid close contact in chicken coops.L McGregor, Falkirk.WITH the easing of rules in England regarding driving during the current Covid- Pandemic and, presumably the movement in that direction in Scotland once our restrictions are deemed safe to relax, I wonder about the lack of toilet facilities The days when you could pop into a cafe, hotel or pub are gone. All closed. Public conveniences likewise. Supermarkets are few and far between.Perhaps its my age John Ewing, Ayr.SINCE the start of the lockdown, attendances at funeral services have been restricted to immediate family. Many relatives have indicated their intention to hold a memorial service when conditions permit.As time elapses, and there is no indication as to when gatherings of larger numbers of people may take place, it is dficult to see how the numbers of such requests can be accommodated.within a realistic time frame.The number of deaths, whether or not Covid  related, which have occurred since the start of lockdown will impose considerable stress on ministers of religion and secular celebrants in an effort to meet those expectations.This will, in all probability, add to the distress of those who have lost someone close to them and is likely to delay the healing process.Malcolm Allan, Bishopbriggs.I HAVE to question whether or not Michael Settle watched the same version of Prime Ministerrsquos Questions as I did on Wednesday, .As an avid watcher of the Commons exchanges every week I was absolutely astounded by his version of events. Sir Keir certainly did not rain blow after forensic blow on the PMrsquos head, he simply asked a series of questions, as is his job, to which Boris Johnson gave considered and confident answers.In addition his assertion that the PM was physically tiring as the pain was piled on, is absolute nonsense.

This could have added benefits such as a drop in carbon emissions as people will spend less time on the roads.Here the government has a role by making sure connectivity is improved. Kumar is hopeful this will happen with the advent of G and believes those areas where connection is poor should be prioritised.Online business is also expected to become more relevant. Digital payments and online commerce have already increased.ldquoMore of us are ordering online and that trend will continue, he said.ldquoBusinesses will have to improve their digital footprint to manage these changes in citizen and consumer behaviour.It is not only the private sector that will have to change but also the public sector as people will expect better communication, for example.Many local authorities still use snail mail to communicate with residents even though simple messages could be sent more cheaply, quickly and safely by SMS or email.ldquoElectronic communications are better in situations like this and local authorities will have to think about how they engage with citizens as opposed to the traditional ways for simple communications, said Kumar. ldquoItrsquos about being smarter in terms of dferentiating the services for dferent citizens.Good information sharing between dferent organisations has also shown to be lacking by the crisis.ldquoWhat we need across both the private and public sector is an infrastructure that allows us to share information securely and quickly, Kumar said. ldquoIt is really necessary for the infrastructure to be improved. We can see this especially in the social care sector - how do we get real time information out on what is happening in care homes, especially for families who have loved ones there and also for the health care agencies so they can provide a better service Another problem caused by the virus is the effect on the economy and Kumar warned there would be a lot of pressure on both the private and public sector to become more cost effective.ldquoFor some time there might be pressure on doing more with less and how we do that ndash itrsquos easier to use automation and so you can focus on more complex things where you need people to get involved, he said.ldquoThe key thing for organisations is to work with their employees and think about their development. They need to make sure their journey is managed with the right skills and training to help them move in their jobs.For example, said Kumar, many organisations have been giving low quality customer experience because their employees are bogged down by mundane tasks rather than focused on customer experience.ldquoAutomation can help that,he said. ldquoOrganisations should be enabling employees who have great insight and experienceand moving them into highvalue jobs.How technology can protect employees and the economyTALK ofrobots may have many people thinking of Arnold Schwarzenegger in The Terminator but the reality is far from terrying and more about how they can improve our lives, according to Kirsty Ramsay, vice-president of CGI UKrsquos Consulting Delivery Centre.She believes the coronavirus pandemic is making society and business stop and think about where we could have been had automation been thoroughly embraced sooner.While public and private sector businesses, have established an element of automation, Ramsay thinks this will speed up in order to make sure employers, employees and students are safe, organise themselves quickly and are able to work and study remotely -there is a second wave of the virus or something similar.As someone with a background in the public sector, she is acutely aware of how efficiency could be improved with more automation and digitalisation. This will be crucial as so much of organisationsrsquo budgets are, quite rightly, being used to support critical services, support clients and employees and introduce new services that mitigate the effects of the virus lockdown.However automation, she says, is not about job losses but about making sure that employees are focussed on the most valuable tasks, so they are not swamped with mundane jobs but can concentrate on what is really important.ldquoWe are not saying that huge swathes of people will disappear and be replaced by robots, she said.ldquoThat is not what is going to happen but some organisations may not, for example, be able to carry the same amount of vacant roles and will start to consider how employees can focus on critical tasks and process exceptions.An example of how automation can help can be seen in a robot that speeds up the process of referral of a patient to a consultant by a GP.ldquoThe number of steps this one task goes through is signicant but actually the doctor is raising a request for a patient to see a consultant, the appointment is put in his diary and a letter is sent out to the patient, said Ramsay.ldquoWe have built a robot that can carry out this repeatable task.

Both sides have tabled full legal texts, there are plenty of precedents, and there is clearly a good understanding between negotiators.ldquoThe major obstacle to this is the EUrsquos insistence on including a set of novel and unbalanced proposals on the so-called ldquolevel playing field which would bind this country to EU law or standards, or determine our domestic legal regimes, in a way that is unprecedented in Free Trade Agreements and not envisaged in the Political Declaration. As soon as the EU recognises that we will not conclude an agreement on that basis, we will be able to make progress.\"Mr Frst siad the UK will now publish all of its draft legal texts next week so that the EU member states can see the argument and approach to obtaining a free trade agreement.He continued: ldquoAlthough we have had useful discussions on fisheries on the basis of our draft legal text, the EU continues to insist on fisheries arrangements and access to UK fishing waters in a way that is incompatible with our future status as an independent coastal state. We are fully committed to agreeing fishing provisions in line with the Political Declaration, but we cannot agree arrangements that are manestly unbalanced and against the interests of the UK fishing industry.ldquoIt is hard to understand why the EU insists on an ideological approach which makes it more dficult to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.ldquoWe very much need a change in EU approach for the next Round beginning on  June. In order to facilitate those discussions, we intend to make public all the UK draft legal texts during next week so that the EUrsquos Member States and interested observers can see our approach in detail.ldquoThe UK will continue to work hard to find an agreement, for as long as there is a constructive process in being, and continues to believe that this is possible."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-calls-brexit-extension-brexit-talks-turn-tetchy","story":"The Conservative government must do \"the only responsible thing\" and extend the transition period, accordind to the SNP as a new poll suggests the majority of the population support an extension.The survey was conducted by Focaldata for Best For Britain, a cross-party group campaigning for close UK.-EU relations.It shows % of Scots and % of people across the UK want Westminster officials to request an extension, including % of Tory voters and % of those who voted to leave the EU in .SNP Shadow International Trade Secretary Stewart Hosie MP said: \"Its clear from the polls that an overwhelming majority of people want the Tory government to agree an extension to the Brexit transition period - that is the only responsible thing to do.\"It would be reckless in the extreme for Boris Johnson to impose a hard Brexit in the middle of a global pandemic and economic crisis.\"Millions of people and businesses are already struggling to get by.

Going into the next academic year, our estimates are in the range of between pound million to pound million ndash depending on what happens with international student intakes.:Coronavirus: Fears universities could be mergedthey dont embrace new normalldquoWe have a very erse higher education system ndash we have brilliant, small, specialist institutions, we have chartered institutions and we have ancient institutions. What we now find is that the more research intensive, internationally-open, big ancient universities are the ones that are much more exposed in this particular crisis ndash those are the institutions that we are having more conversations with about their strategies and about their scenarios.Ms Watt also told MSPs that it was likely that Scotlandrsquos colleges could lose around pound million in the   financial year.She said that her organisation has not received a flurry of demands for refunds from students, but stressed it could become an issueinstitutions struggled to offer tuition digitally.She said: ldquoIf for example, an institution was really struggling to keep going with tuition, particularly making sure that they have adequate online provision, then I think there may well be a case for students to look at what they are being provided.ldquoEvery institution, as far as we are seeing it, is very, very quickly pivoted into providing support and online provision ndash and therefore, I think, we are seeing less requirement for refunds and less of a demand for it.:Universities hold the key to economic recovery ndash but there must be noto austerityLabour education spokesperson, Iain Gray, told MSPs he has previously quizzed Education Secretary John Swinney over its funding model for Scottish students going to university without paying fees ndash claiming ldquoit does not pay  per cent of the costs.He added: ldquoWhen I have put that to him, and asked him to justy that, hersquos always done so on the basis that universities are able to raise income otherwise through commercial means but signicantly through fees received from international students .ldquoEveryone looking at the situation believes that there is going to be an enormous decline in those fees for our universities.

You take away that foundation, as has unexpectedly happened with the Covid crisis, and the rest of it could topple.:Richard Lochhead: We must protect universities, they are key to Covid recoveryldquoMany in the sector have been quite forthcoming with warnings about their finances for quite some time and long before the current crisis.ldquoThe reality is that we donrsquot know whatrsquos going to happen in the future and I would expect the SFC to be modelling dferent scenarios, the best and the worst case ndash but the worst case could be that no-one is able to .Labour MSP Daniel Johnson asked Ms Watt whether the Scottish Government has asked them to look at the situationScottish students were asked to pay tuition fees.She said: ldquoAt the minute, it isnrsquot government policy.ldquoThis administration has not asked the funding council to model charging ndash so that would not be one of the options that the government has asked us to model at this point in time.Nicola Sturgeon has refuted any suggestion of introducing fees for Scottish students.She said: \"I think my views on the importance of access to education being based on your ability to learn, not your ability to pay, is really important ndash I think its a principle coming out of a crisis, I would want to work hard to protect.:Scottish Government asks Westminster for universities to be bailed out\"We are also working very closely with universities and will continue to do so.

A collective approach could help to restore public confidence that our leaders are pulling together.This is not about dropping blame at anyone’s door. The reality however is that in recent days and weeks, attempts to formulate responses to the coronavirus are more notable for apparent disagreements between national governments than for policy substance. We need governments to build consensus and create a shared responsibility across the UK.”We are calling for a more joined up response to what is a cross-governmental challenge – by establishing a coronavirus Joint Ministerial Committee “A coronavirus JMC with an enhanced remit, meeting regularly and with an approach based on consensus and shared responsibility would help to reduce disputes, with all governments involved in developing plans.”It would help to refocus coronavirus response based on national and regional needs rather than political borders. This solution could help reduce the chaos of the current political climate – and point the way towards a better long-term crisis response mechanism in future.”We believe that an enhanced JMC for the coronavirus crisis is the right way to give people confidence in their governments during this time – with a message that leaders are working with, rather than against each other.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He also asked ministersthe businesses case would be reappraised in light of the impact of COVID- on air travel. In response, the transport secretary, Michael Matheson confirmed that the business case will not be reviewed and that work to implement the strategy “will continue in parallel with work to prepare the IIA ” rather than be deferred.As part of his answer to Mr McArthur, Mr Matheson said good air connectivity will continue to be essential to support economic recovery in all parts of Scotland and that recovery will benefit from having more reliable and sustainable air services.#The main argument for the centralisation of the ATC services has been that modernisation was needed and the use of new technologies at the airports affected, which includes Kirkwall, would maker services more reliable.After receiving the responses, Mr McArthur said: “This is a remarkable assertion by the Transport Secretary, which shows a blatant disregard for the provisions of the Islands Act. If a major procurement process can be allowed to continue before any island impact assessment is completed, it rather suggests that ministers have little interest in what that assessment might conclude.“At a time when the future shape of air travel is so uncertain, at the very least Ministers and HIAL should be taking stock. Instead, both seem entirely happy to press on asnothing has happened.“No-one disputes the need for investment in modernising air traffic control services at airports across the region. Yet, plans to centralise services was always recognised as the most risky and costly of the options available.  In light of current restrictions, the island impact assessment offered the perfect opportunity to review this decision. “Sadly, the Scottish Government and HIAL have chosen to pass up that opportunity, while also doing little to inspire confidence amongst islanders about the value of the Islands Act”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But that#s got to come from the islands themselves.#I#m not trying to say it will happen, at all, but it#s a live discussion. I am not discounting it, and neither am I going to say it#s going to happen — but I do think it#s worth considering.

He said: “We are very disappointed that we have been unable to carry out a public event in Hoy.#The previous event that we held in Hoy, and indeed public events we have held where in Orkney during the project, have been very beneficial in meeting with the public to talk about Orkney’s Community Wind Farm Project.“The emergency legislation passed by the Scottish Government is vital in keeping projects on track to support our future economic and societal recovery, businesses and jobs and avoiding delays to infrastructure and other developments.“It’s really important to us that members of the public are offered the best opportunity possible under the current circumstances to make their views known about the plans so that we can consider this before we submit our application.#We have worked hard to develop a consultation plan which gives as much flexibility as possible to allow folk to provide that input and are hopeful for a high level of participation.”The council intends to submit a planning application later this year.The project is part of a project which also includes proposed wind farm developments at Quanterness and on Faray in the North Isles.The development will consist of up to six turbines with a maximum blade-tip height of .m, access tracks, crane hardstandings, turbine foundations, underground cabling, on-site substation and maintenance building, a temporary construction compound, potential excavations borrow workings and a permanent meteorological mast.The objective of the PAC is for communities to be better informed about major and national development proposals and to have an opportunity to contribute their views before a formal planning application is submitted to the planning authority.It should be noted that comments made to OIC through this PAC process are not representations to the planning authority.

Some people and even businesses have been tricked into paying for protective face masks and hand sanitizers from companies that don’t exist.There have also been messages from criminals sending messages to trick people into thinking they are getting genuine offers of financial support from the government.At the same time hackers are stepping up attempts to access people’s networks and steal their log in details and passwords.However,you take sensible precautions, you can quickly spot signs of fraud and identy the facts from the fiction.Sharing the right information could save lives.When it, is shared,  information can take on a le of its own and have some serious consequences.It can lead to health scares,  accusations and potentially damaging hoax stories.

a new and continuous cough or a high temperature # are being reminded to isolate themselves for seven days.Anyone  in a household where someone has symptoms should still isolate for  days.England says thank you, Boris. #You can now sunbath!#. Now, why does not Nicola change the dictate for Shetland  We would love to sunbath also, between the snow showers!!!!!😂😂😂😂How fortunate that the Scottish, Welsh and Irish leaders are maintaining their more sensible , balanced and wary approaches .Enlighten us Haydn, why is the infection rate lowerin England than in Wales and Scotland  I for one am not the least confused by the messages, just what is confusing you She niver agrees wIth what the rest off the UK IS DOINGBruce, you make it look asNicola, is acting like a Tory##..The Tory policy being##..me, me, me and melolSince you appear to not know, there has been confusion in Britain today about the actual meaning of BoJo’s statement yesterdayand , as I write, he is trying to explain himself away on TV. THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that.

On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful.

There were quotes from Annie MacLean of Raasay, and from Ruth Coghill, Vi Beaton, and Mary Black, who all remembered seeing the surrender, as well as a photo of German sailors at Kyle station which is in the Archive service collections.I seem to remember that Mary Carmichael located a film of part of the surrender, as I remember watching it, but I am afraid I can#t remember where it originated # maybe the Imperial War museum, maybe the Scottish Film Archive.There were probably many other references to submarine activity and the end of the war where in the book, and also in the actual recordings.I can#t remember whether both the Museum and the Archive service kept copies of the recordings, or whether it was just one of them.Every contributor got a copy of the book, as did local schools, and it was also for sale so you may have come across a copy.

From Monday, we were caught off guard ourselves with the amount of people, we had  repairs left in with us. Typically, we would get  repairs over a period of three weeks.There have been people coming in asking about bikes to commute to work, and those with bikes in their sheds and garages are now bringing them in to get repaired, so they can use them to get to work.He continued: With kids# bikes, we#re nearly sold out of them.

Meanwhile, in Londonderry, Michael McLoone, who owns Total Cycling based in Pennyburn, said he cannot keep up with the demand for bikes.He said: I have never seen anything like this - it is insane. We sold out of all the bikes we had that cost around £, although we still have more expensive bikes.We can#t get any more of the more affordable bikes from the suppliers because they have run out, too.I suspect the suppliers and the manufacturers were caught on the hop, too, so I have a feeling we will have to wait on next year#s stock to come in, which will probably not be until the end of the summer - this just caught everybody on the hop.What people are also doing is bringing us their old bikes that they have pulled out from the back of the garage for repair.I don#t understand this really, I don#t knowit is because most of the other shops are closed and people have time on their hands, but I have never been busier.Second-hand bike store, Belfast City Centre Cycles, has also reported an increase in commuters wanting bikes, revealing that it sold out of bicycles two weeks ago.We#re on the budget end of things and our business has increased three-fold, said the owner, who did not want to be named.At the minute, we have a waiting list for repairs and I#m doing -hour days working on them.

We just felt it was wrong that it couldn#t happen.Mrs Foster said ministers had authorised that move after being contacted by a Banbridge woman whose terminally ill cousin wanted to get married.The First Minister said that the Executive was trying to be open and transparent with the public, and would publish the matrix behind its decision-making on the Department of Health website.It is important that everyone understands that the process of relaxing restrictions will be incremental and there won#t be a dramatic sht, she added.The coronavirus death toll rose to  in Northern Ireland yesterday after a further five fatalities were announced.The coronavirus death toll has risen to , in the Republic after a further  deaths were announced yesterday.Mrs O#Neill said: The changes to the restrictions that we have agreed today have been considered in detail and have been informed by scientic and medical advice. We must remember that the regulations are in place to save lives and the Executive does not take decisions on whether to maintain, or indeed to relax the restrictions, lightly.The Deputy First Minister stressed that the Executive#s advice was that people who have been told to shield at home by the NHS must continue to do so for  weeks.She promised that when the message changed, it would be swtly communicated.Mrs O#Neill repeated her call for universal testing in care homes. The Deputy First Minister said the Executive will hold further discussions next week about potentially lting some other restrictions as part of the first step of its five step roadmap out of lockdown.These are gradual, small baby steps we are taking, she added.Hopefully today is a little step or a glimmer of light for people.However, she stressed that there was no room for complacency.Meanwhile, childcare providers were encouraged by the Education Minister Peter Weir and Health Minister Robin Swann to apply for the Executive#s £m package of measures to support the sector.Application forms for the Covid- Childcare Support Scheme and the Bespoke Approved Home Childcare Scheme have already been issued.Mr Weir explained: We established the Covid- Childcare Support Scheme to enable childcare providers to meet the needs of key workers and vulnerable children at this very dficult time and to provide support to daycare and school age childcare settings, which are not able to remain open.The minister added: I know that it is essential that we get financial support to settings and to childminders without further delay and we are committed to doing that.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfastis a member of IPSO and subscribes to its Editors Code of PracticeIpsoSitemapContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyPaid-for content PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsAn INM Websitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty"},{"url":null,"title":"retired nurses poignant ode to deserted giants causeway","story":"Inspired: Lynda Tissington FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappInspired: Lynda TissingtonBy Leona O#NeillMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailA retired nurse on lockdown in Co Antrim has taken to writing poetry to shine a light on one of Northern Ireland#s best known tourist attractions, which now lies deserted.  Manchester-born Lynda Tissington , who moved to Northern Ireland  years ago when her husband Jack helped build the M, walks past the Giant#s Causeway every day for her hour of exercise.After finding the world-renowned beauty spot completely deserted the mother-of-four and grandmother-of-eight put pen to paper in verse to capture the eeriness and silence of the famous stones. I have been locked down for eight weeks just because of my age, she says. Although I am very fit, I go out for a walk every day and that#s it.We have a system here in Bushmills, which is a wonderful community, where a lady gets me my shopping. My neighbours have all been very goodI needed anything.I walk along the coast, above where the Giant#s Causeway is. I would know the stones well. When we have visitors we always take them there.I wrote the poem because the causeway is usually chock-a-block. There are tourist buses going up and down the roads. The big cruise ships bring bus loads of people down here. The paths are usually so busy, and there are far too many people at times.But now Lynda is seeing things in a dferent light as there are so few people around. I would walk along there, along the top looking down at the stones and it is so, so quiet. There isn#t a soul around. It#s quite eerie, but it is lovely. Usually when you#re looking down there it is full of people.They look like little ants, walking all over the Giant#s Causeway, climbing all over the stones and walking down to the bottom, the place they call the organ. It#s such a lovely place, but it#s even nicer now that it#s gone all still and quiet and the flowers are all out on the paths going up there.It was the stillness that inspired her to write the poem.I wrote the poem after being out for an hour and not seeing one other person. The path going up to the causeway was empty, as was the golf course and the beach.I was inspired by the causeway, I saw the main columns standing around like a gaggle of girls gossiping. And I had never seen them clearly like that before. I was just meandering about and it came to me. These are such strange times, hopefully people will be back on them again soon.I write little things from time to time, but I#m not a poet. I have nothing  to do, so I thought I#d do that. It#s the first poem I have written.Lynda says, like many people of her generation, she is trying to cope with the isolation of lockdown.I am an avid reader, I#m doing jigsaws and I like to walk every day, she says. I miss the people, a lot of people my age miss the company.She added: It#s a funny old time and it#s hard to believe when you wake up in the morning it#s happening and it#s not going to go away for a long time.Giant#s Causeway - Silence of the StonesHere we girls standClustered together in our columnsSunshine on our headsOur feet in the sea…and silence!No longer do people comeClambering over us in their heavy bootsScreaming and shouting in many tonguesPoking and touching us in sometimes intimate places!This is our respite, time to breatheTime to smell the flowers...But we#ve been here thousands of yearsWe#re going nowhereAnd in months to come we#ll welcome you backWe#ll all be refreshed and le will go onWe girls still standing tall in our columns.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Tuesday saw the ninth edition of the County Derry Post without a match report, without an athletics update and without any kind of preview. Getting bogged down in feature and nostalgia pieces gives sports journalists the opportunity to chat with characters and legends from yesteryear. It is the perfect therapy. Living and working in isolation, is just how le is at the moment. You appreciate a daily run and the chirping birds all the more. Every day seems the same, but some things are dotted in to keep the week structured. googletag.cmd.push Joe McCloskey hosts a zoom quiz for our circle of friends, so that means it is Saturday at .pm. Fr Doherty delivers mass via the webcam, so that means it is Sunday morning at . and proofing pages means it is Monday and deadline time. Our daughter Erins school, St Brigids   Bunscoil Naomh Briacuted in Tirkane, have been excellent at rolling out enough work to keep her engaged. I play Muacuteinteoir Daidaiacute and set out a few tasks. Not a lot, but just enough to maintain some sort of structure. There is so much out there that is learning, the practical stuff. My we Pauline took her on a nature walk to pick wild flowers for a May altar. Granny Sally is teaching her how to grow tomatoes and the treehouse, crafted by Granda Mickey, is getting well tested. And all the teddies made an appearance in the garden to make a zoo, as shown in the picture above. googletag.cmd.push It is just great to be able to spend time with your family. Then one evening came a statement that just stopped me in my tracks. “Daddy, when this is all over, can we go to that Kitchen place in Magherafelt for a chocolate milkshake,” Erin asked. Her this is the coronavirus and she is talking about Shorty McNallyscafe, a hub of chat. Erin always get a milkshake and I get the half and half with chicken curry that always hits the spot. Erin follows up: “Daddy...when will this all be over ” “I dont know pet,” comes my answer. And I dont. I feel tiny and helpless. At this stage, the penny drops. What must be going on in their wee heads  The schoolwork is irrelevant. They will all catch-up sometime. A cuddle and some reassurance that you are there for them is more important. Every Thursday night, a round of applause is dedicated to those working in the NHS and on front line. But me, my thoughts are also dedicated to the children out there. They have also been thrust into a whole world of uncertainty. God love them. One thing is certain though...Shortys next serving of milkshake and curry will never taste better.

James O’Donnell frequently takes photos of his beloved dog ‘Iggy’ in some of the most spectacular locations around the county. And she is now becoming a bit of a celebrity with thousands of people all over the world going online to see the Border Collie with stunning Donegal backdrops behind her. In one week recently, Iggy-related photos reached over a quarter of a million people on facebook. Falcarragh-based James has been building up a collection of photos with nine-year-old Iggy, and his work has attracted a lot of attention. googletag.cmd.push Indeed, in March, he had been scheduled to go to America for a number of exhibitions, starting in Florida. But the onset of Covid- meant the flights had to be cancelled. Nevertheless, he is hoping to go to New York later in the summer for another exhibition and possibly also to Connecticut. His talent is such that his work has attracted the attention of highly regarded veteran Magnum Photos member Elliott Erwittand Samuel Holmes , and through them steps were put in place for the planned exhibitions. The fact that they have been in contact highlights just what an impact James is making. googletag.cmd.push After World War II, a number of photographers banded together to form Magnum Photos, an organisation dedicated to chronicling world events - and named for the magnum-sized bottle of wine that they drank at each meeting! The process of becoming a full member of Magnum Photos takes a minimum of four years. Photographers are only considered once a year, during Magnums Annual General Meeting in June, where one day is set aside for considering and voting on potential new members portfolios. It is highly prestigious. “I love promoting Donegal,” James said, pointing out that he actually takes all his photos on his mobile phone! James lived in London for many years, before ing home to Donegal, and he adores the outside world and doing his bit to showcase and promote the county in any way that he can. Last year he produced a calendar called “Iggy’s Donegal” - filled with fine pictures from ramblings and hikes around Donegal - and it proved to be very popular. Recently a photo taken by James attracted the attention of BBC Northern Ireland weather forecaster Barra Best. Best tweeted the photo and commented that it was a “great example” of “an extremely rare phenomenon” known as Kelvin-Helmholtz clouds. The stunning imageof the cloud formation was taken from the Back Strand in Falcarragh, and needless to say, also featured Iggy. All the indications are that Iggy is on the way to being a great ambassador for Donegal, and while this will be a terribly dficult year for those in the tourism sector here, at least James and Iggy are publicising to the world some of the great sights to see. The story made the front page of this week’s Donegal Post newspaper and is featured in this Thursday’s Donegal Democrat .

For many couples, Slaughtneil was more than just an exercise in adolescent revelry. It became the starting point for the rest of their romantic lives. The County Derry Post caught up with four couples for whom Slaughtneil will always be a special place. Sarah and Eamonn Darragh  “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really.”  Kilrea man Eamonn Darragh his we, Bellaghy woman Sarah have an age-old Slaughtneil ritual to thank for fate bringing them together back in . googletag.cmd.push In this case, fate had a name. “Whenever I was at primary school, I was friendly with a fella called Shay Quinn,” said Sarah. “I played with him on the boys’ football team. He was the year above me and when I got to St Pat’s the year after, him and Eamonn were friends. “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really. I saw him on nights out at Slaughtneil and in school, and that was how things started.” The disco holds special signicance for Sarah and Eamonn, whose relationship grew as the hills of south Derry reverberated to the incoherent sounds of Mark McCabe. googletag.cmd.push “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil,” she said. “You’d have been checking the Mid Ulster Observer every week to checkit was going to be a late night, orit was a foam party. “Then you had to be good to your parents all week and put the feelers out on a Wednesday or Thursday to seeyou could go. “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil. Eamonn got the bus up from Kilrea and I would get it from Bellaghy on a Friday night, and we continued our relationship from there. “If we both weren’t there, we wouldn’t have met each other, we wouldn’t have been married and having a babyI hadn’t met him through Shay at the disco.” Enda and Laura Heron  “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me!”  For many involved with the GAA, the word ‘lap’ doesn’t conjure up many positive thoughts, butyou ask anyone who crossed the door of Slaughtneil disco, it’s a dferent story. Laura Heron was embarking on a lap of the hall when she bumped into the man who would later become her husband, but they were lucky to be there at all. “We met around the Millennium, when we thought the world was going to end,” she said. “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me! “We had a wee kiss that night, but we met a year later, when we were  or so, going to the Elk and the sparks flew from then on.” Even the soundtrack to the encounter belied its good fortune, as the pair met to the unmistakable sound of ‘Toca’s Miracle’ by ‘Fragma’. Memories of going to the disco are still fresh in her mind. “You were always excited to go, you couldn’t wait until Friday night came,” she said. “We always got DCs Coaches from Bellaghy. That was part of the fun too, heading up on the bus for that opportunity to have fun with your friends at the weekend, after school was over. “When you’re that age, going to Slaughtneil when you’re in fourth year or whatever, you think you’re an adult, that you know everything. You don’t realise that you were still a child. “We got married in  and were going out for about  years or so. We went to Australia for a year and came home and settled down from that point, but it all began in Slaughtneil hall.” Jenna Mulhern and David Donnelly  “If he was driving about, we’d always meet at Slaughtneil and we started going steady when we were .”  When Dungiven woman Jenna Mulhern met her husband-to-be David, from Ballinascreen, his time at Slaughtneil disco had been brought to a premature end. “He was actually known in Slaughtneil as ‘Davy Bash’, because he was always in rows,” said Jenna. “He couldn’t come in because he was barred from the place for fighting – that’s why he had to drive about outside. “We got talking, and then the following week, I met him again and we had our first curt.” Jenna remembers her uncle leaving her and her friends over to the disco and having to suffer their excited, and quite vocal anticipation. “My uncle used to leave us over and God love him, he had to listen to the biggest pile of rubbish in that car,” she recalled. “Once we landed it was brilliant, meeting up with everybody and then sneaking out halfway through the night to meet Davy. “Young ones now will never experience anything like it. We couldn’t wait to get dressed up on a Friday night and have a wee blue WKD on the way over. “I know a lot who would have went to Slaughtneil and are still with the same people. I’d say a lot of people have met their first loves there.” Kieran and Paula Tully  “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes!”  There are dozens of women who can look back at Slaughtneil as the place where they met and their future husbands, but a much lesser number who were proposed to there. Paula Tully’s husband Kieran, overcome by the intoxicating mix of perfume and freshly cut turf, popped the question after the couple left the hall for some air back in . “That particular night we came out to be on our own on the bus. I could nearly point out where it was sitting,” said Paula. “We weren’t saying the Rosary now, but we weren’t doing anything bad either! That’s when Kieran asked me to marry him.” “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes. We went steady until just after I was . When you think about it now, it’s crazy how young we were.” With Kieran from Ballerin and Paula from Glenullin, their story has a Romeo and Juliet feel, with love prospering amid the pitched battles going on around them. “I remember one of my friends fell out with me for a month when I started going with Kieran, because he was from Ballerin and I was from the Glen! “At that time, you had the gang of boys from the Glen that fought with the gang of boys from Ballerin. She thought I was being a complete traitor.” The couple continued the Slaughtneil theme throughout their relationship, with DJ Terry McIl, who played on the very first night of the disco, performing at their wedding. “Our weans think it’s hilarious, that it’s crazy,” laughed Paula. “We had brilliant memories, I don’t regret a second of it. We’ll be  years married this August. If I was to do it all again, I would not change a thing.” See also: SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: Spinning the soundtrack to a timless era SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: The goose that laid the golden egg.

As the attention ed to the main news, the reporter laughed in recognition. “Oh I know it very well, I used to go to the discos there,” she explained. That level of cultural reach does not happen overnight, nor without a huge effort from volunteers within the club. Current chairperson, Sean McGuigan, was on the committee when the disco began in  and said running the disco was a huge undertaking. “You really had to put your le on hold, because on a Friday night you couldn’t go anywhere,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “You had to go up the road to the hall. You could have had  or more people there. Evenyou didn’t go, you felt a bit guilty in case something happened and you weren’t there. “I can laugh about it now, but it was a very busy time. You were away out about half ,  o’clock and you wouldn’t have got back ‘til nearly  or  o’clock in the morning.”  Keen to enlist parental support in south Derry and beyond, the club pulled out all the stops, placing bouncers on the bus and manning the hall with vigilance. googletag.cmd.push The plan, on the whole, was a success and reams of teenagers packed the buses every Friday night to make the journey to Emmet Park. “I think parents knew that their weans were being bussed to the disco and home again,” said Sean. “There was no drink allowed on the bus, we took it off them before they got on. Parents bought into that, that they were being looked after when they came to Slaughtneil, which they were. “We had a fella Hugh Convery, God rest him. Standing on the floor he was ft  or so, maybe more. Once he stood up on to the brown chairs, people came in, saw big Hugh and they never moved!”  Securing reliable transport for the hundreds of young people who attended Slaughtneil was crucial to its success, which surprised many of the club’s members. “We met the bus people and went with the bus to certain towns,” said Sean. “I remember one night I saw the lights of the bus showing a sign for Donemana and I said to John Joe Kearney ‘Jesus John Joe, we’re a long way from home’. “Henry Kearney used to have to go out some Saturday mornings to Bobby McLaughlin or some of the bus men to keep them quiet!” On some occasions, Monday night committee meetings were taken up entirely by the business of organising the following Friday’s disco. In the late s and early s, two groups of boisterous young men from dferent parts of south Derry were causing the club a few headaches. “There used to be a couple of gangs from south Derry,” recalled Sean. “One was called the Banana Gang and they were from Bellaghy. The other was the Gorilla Gang and they were from Draperstown or Ballinascreen. “Those two gangs’ names would have been mentioned at our meetings every Monday night! The main part of the meeting was always about the disco and who was on on Friday night. “There was the odd wee scrap, and we had to throw the odd boy out for misbehaving, but when you think back now, they weren’t doing a wile lot of harm. “I remember when I was going to dances around Ardboe and the Castle and places like that and there were riots, really bad fights. There was never anything like that at our disco.”  The club’s coffers were rapidly expanding with every passing week, but, as the saying goes,you’re standing still, you’re moving backwards, and the disco had to evolve. That evolution wasn’t just focused on what was happening on the stage or in the hall. “We had to stamp them,” said Sean. “I remember children coming in saying they were paying for three people, throwing the fiver in, and not even waiting for their change. “I had to go to Donegal Pass to meet a fella to buy all these stampers, but the youngsters were getting the stamp and going back out and stamping all their friends when it was still wet! “We learned a lot. We stopped letting the children out until a certain time from the hall to stop it. “They used to try and spice it up too. Some nights they would have a foam party, or give out free Walkmans – they were pound a piece back then! Other nights, breakdancers came and danced through the hall.”  Having done a twenty-year stretch, and resulted in several marriages, the disco finally began to peter out in the mid-s. Attendances fell as teenagers’ choices of entertainment became more erse, and the club eventually pulled the plug. Sean McGuigan says the club can look back on that period with pride as an era in which their collective shoulder was firmly to the wheel. “You actually couldn’t do it now. There were some nights in there that the hall was jammed,” he said. “I’m not sure what took over, I saw some nights where there were only  in the hall. Everyone’s batteries got flat and then they stopped it. “A lot of us were glad it was all over, because it was hectic, but it made us a lot of money. It was only a pound in, which is pittance, but it was that big a crowd. “You were taking in around pound a week and on big nights, you could have got pound,. “There was a fair wee bit of pride went into it because the only time the price went up was for a late night. “At the meetings, people used to discuss raising the price, but the attitude was ‘we’re not going to destroy the goose that laid the golden egg’.” The teenagers of  move in a dferent era to those that went before them, who are probably glad that the walls of Slaughtneil hall are mute. “You actually couldn’t do it now,” said Sean. He’s probably right.

It has now grown into one of the most vibrant clubs around. Michael McMullan asked Club PRO PC Convery about the clubs growth... Michael McMullan: Well PC, when and how did Carn Wheelers come into existence  Was there a club there before that  PC Convery: Initially two local men Tommie McGrath and Sean Kerr would have cycled together as a pastime before the official formation of Carn Wheelers. Both were marathon runners and opted for two wheels in between runs. Sean was inspired to take up cycling following Stephen Roche’s win in The Tour de France, Giro d’Italia and the World Championship in . Sean was a member of East Tyrone Cycling Club at that time and took part in races and time trials and had several podium finishes. googletag.cmd.push  There were a couple of local cycling clubs - Moyola Cycle Club and the South Derry Wheelers which were in existence prior to Carn Wheelers. There were dferences in structure and affiliation and there was an identied need to form a local club. Moyola Cycle Club was formed in the s but the membership waned in the s and cyclists then joined other local clubs like East Tyrone and Bann Valley. Carn Wheelers registered as an official cycling club with Cycling Ireland in  . Sean also designed the first kit which was worn for several years after. In late   the official launch of the new club kit was held in Walsh’s Hotel, Maghera. googletag.cmd.push M McM: How did they know there was an appetite for a club  PC: The founding members were Tommie McGrath, Pat Purvis, Nigel Henry and Sean Kerr. The first official AGM was held in  in the Naiscoil in Maghera with around  members at the meeting and Pat Purvis was elected as first chairman. M McM: Cycling wasnt as nearly as popular back then as it is now. Was it more about exercise and leisure at that time or was there also a racing element  PC: Yes, in the formative years it was about leisure cycles with the group leaving Maghera on a Sunday morning, and coming home together a few hours later tired but having enjoyed plenty of craic. The club was able to break into racing groups at that time as well. It was a couple of years after that before we held our first open races. The first club racing program of Time Trialsand road racing was established in  after an increased number of Carn Wheelers started to race at Bann Valley and East Tyrone.The first inidual to race was Gerry Kelly at Bann Valley and Gerry was also the first Carn Wheeler to win a road race in an East Tyrone club race in May . Barry Russell was the first Carn Wheeler to get a podium place in an open race with second place at Phoenix GP in February  and since then there have been many more wins and podiums. The very first Carn Classic open race was held on Sunday, March ,  in Tobermore.Padraig Douganwas chairman then and it took place on Wood Road course. Carn Wheelers used Tobermore United Football Club as sign on and prize giving. M McM: I remember cycling with the club for a few years around . I noticed the club really starting to grow. What would you put that down to  PC: The popularity of cycling had started to take off all over with Cycling Ireland membership also on the rise. A large number of retired sports people were also looking for some form of exercise that was sociable and also those who liked that bit of competition got involved in racing. With more people out cycling, races started to increase in numbers all over and someone once said cycling was the new golf. The likes of the Giro dItalia, which was held in Ireland for the first time in , promoted cycling and encouraged people to get out on their bikes. In April , Wendy Houvenaghel, linked with the club on their weekly Sunday morning cycle.A native of Upperlands, Wendy ed home following her Olympic success winning the silver medal at the  Beijing Olympic Games. She also won gold in the same year in the  Track Cycling World Championships. The club got a major seal of approval when she joined the club as an honorary member. The aim was to raise money to help her pursue her Olympic dream in  where she was aiming to improve on the silver medal she won in Beijing. An invitation was sent out from Carn Wheelers to cyclists everywhere to join them and have the opportunity to meet with Wendy both before and after the cycle, and to cycle along with her on a planned route from Maghera to Portstewart and . As a result, Wendy gave local cycling a much needed boost and encouraged others to take up the sport. M McM: There was very much a strong leave nobody behind mentality to the cycling. Is that still the same  PC: Yes that was and still is a strong motto in the club, although there are dferent groups within the club out cycling the club still promotes the leaving no one behind. All new cyclists are encouraged, but it is advisable to cycle on your own and gradually increase the miles before joining a group. The group cycles are well-organised and the route is usually agreed and communicated in advance. Over the years there have been many organised cycles and in  Carn Wheelers also organised a charity cycle to Donegal and . M McM: The Tour of South Derry is synonymous with the club. When did it begin  PC: The first Tour of South Derry was held in October  and there were  cyclists who took part in that event. Cyclists came from as far away as Cork to participate in the cycle at that time. In  there was a peak entry of  cyclists and in recent years there are between  and  participants from cycling clubs all over as well as other cyclists who are not affiliated with any club. The Tour of South Derry is usually the last Sportive of the cycling calendar, traditionally held on the second Sunday of October. It is a very well-run sportive which is very well marshalled and there is a choice of two routes to suit all abilities. The refreshments before and after are very well received. The event has always been affiliated with MacMillan Cancer Relief and has been a huge fundraiser and since the tour began. Carn Wheelers raised over pound, over the years for this worthy cause. The club are grateful to Mickey Donnelly, who has been the main organiser and contact with MacMillan since . Unfortunately their Mid-Ulster branch has now folded, so the club will seek a new charity partner for forthcoming events. M McM: There has been a lot of success - the likes of Cathir Doyle and Marc Heaney going to cycle at a high level and also the mountain-biking. Did it come from the early years of the underage cycling  PC: Carn Wheelers always had an ethos on cycling for all ages, gender and abilities. There was a focus on youth development and as some of the parents were actively involved the children developed an interest and this was identied early in the club’s development.The club had a group that were interested in the MTB scene and the parents thought it was a safe environment to introduce youth to biking, it provided the youth with a chance to build their bike handling skills and because there were MTB races they were able to add a bit of competition. Although the numbers involved are small compared to other sports we continue to have some very good young cyclists racing at the minute on the road, MTB, Cyclocross and the track, and some have won national and provincial titles. The first MTB race was held in Davagh Forest in June , long before the trails were built. Carn Wheelers members developed a course after many weeks of hard graft wheeling stones and cutting back branches to have the tracks ready and the competition has continued each year since. M McM: The likes of the Cycle around Ireland trek last year has been a huge mark on the club and there are many sportives. Is the club as vibrant as ever  PC: Yes the Cycle around Ireland last year was very well supported and raised nearly pound, for STEPS mental health charity. It was a brilliant achievement for the eight cyclists who took part and who pushed themselves to the limit cycling over , miles in just over  hours to support this worthy cause in their community. This year we have some members who had organised to attend events which unfortunately were cancelled, we had a number of members booked to complete in the Joe Barr endurance event and we would have had racing up and running at this stage. The race calendar had just been published a couple of weeks before lockdown and the very popular Carn Classic road Race was due to take place on  April  but unfortunately had to be cancelled. We would say the club is as vibrant as ever, our membership unlike some other clubs has remained stable andevents were on we would have members taking part in the sportives all over Ireland. Leisure cycling is on the increase and last year members took part in the Tour de Conamara, Westport Gran Fondo, the Ring of Clare and the Tour de Boyne Valley as well as local club sportives.Following feedback from club members Carn Wheelers launched a new club kit in March . It was a move away from the traditional green and black which had been in existence since the club started. The new colour was introduced by former chairman Ali Gribbon as it more visible on the road to motorists and should make cycling safer for all. M McM: How have you been dealing with the lockdown  Is solo cycling giving people an avenue to manage their mental health - get out, stay fit and healthy  It has a big part to play.PC: Cycling is an excellent pastime for physical and mental health and the social aspect of the group cycles is important especially when the cycle takes in a coffee stop on the route as it gives iniduals an opportunity to socialise.The club has tried to be at the forefront of trying to encourage our members to continue cycling but of course following the rules of social distancing, it has been dficult for many who have had events cancelled or had been training for the racing season. We are no dferent than any other sports and with the recent good weather members are getting lots of solo miles in, each of our groups are also keeping in touch with each other via Facebook and WhatsApp groups which is also very important. This means that we can check in on each other until we can get back out cycling in groups. There have been no group cycles since early March and people are instead encouraged to cycle solo. Thankfully the roads have been relatively quiet as there was less traffic and the good weather in April has encouraged many to build up their miles on the bike.Last year we launched a very successful Couch to K programme which ran on consecutive Monday nights during the summer. It was very popular and over  cyclists participated under the guidance of experienced club cyclists. We had anticipated that it would run again this year but this was not possible due to the current lockdown due to the Covid-. Cyclists have been training over the winter to prepare for the summer season of races, time trials, sportives, endurance events and other competitions. There is a saying within the club which is winter miles  summer smiles so it is unfortunate that all the events have been cancelled for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless cycling is an excellent sport for physical and mental well-being as well as social contact. It is sport which continues to develop and the future of Carn Wheelers is looking very promising.

Its just after lunch last Friday afternoon and Colm Mulholland rolls back the years. Seated in his Lavey home, he surveys across the South Derry landscape.Theres not a cloud in the sky, as clear as Colms voice coming down the phone.“I can even pick out the Carn and Slaughtneil from here,” utters the  year-old.Its the picturesque landscape his we Mairead, nee OConnell, spent a lot of her childhood in, at her Granny and Granda McKennas in Tirkane and a panorama she can view every day.Maireads late brother Sean lit up the attack in Derrys  All-Ireland final team, while her future husband Colm was the defensive linchpin.Over  years later, Colm is content. Football and golf, the sports he gave much of his le to, are etched consistently through the conversation.“I feel quite good, but I wouldnt just like to be walking too far,” Colm offers.Five years ago, he acquired a golf buggy – complete with flashing neon orange light - to help him navigate his way around the parish.“I can still play a bit of golf, but this coronavirus has put an end to that.” he continues.One afternoon, Fergal Shorty McNally was lining out Lavey bottom pitch. Down the hill came Colms buggy, before he got out and swung his driver. Ping. The ball went  yards up the pitch.Colm would regularly call in at the pitch, to run his eye over whatever game or training session was going on.Sport still figures highly in his thoughts.The upcoming Lavey underage are quite good, he comments before inquisitively enquiring of another opinion on their quality. He listens intently, happy that the clubs latest crop have potential. googletag.cmd.push *** Colms father Daniel married Bellaghy woman Elizabeth Glackin and brought up a family of nine, in the townland of Ballymacpeake.After getting married, Colm moved to Ballinascreen, where Mairead taught. He bought the Burnside Innin the town, farmed nearby in Moneyneana and was getting his own contracting business off the ground.He later ed to the outskirts of Gulladuff, renovated the house where they raised four children – Don, Sinead, Martin and Brid.Colm won a scholarship to attend St Columbs in Derry. However, with a farm in the family, he didnt take up the offer.“I went into the civil engineering business,” Colm outlines. “I had a lot of men employed at that time, I bought machines when I was young. It was the type of work that suited me very well. There was a lot of road jobs with heavy and light machinery, you had to have good machinery.”After that, Colm got into horticulture and harvesting of peat in Gortnahey. His son Don remembers spending summers up there.“I can remember me and a few of the McGurks going up to work there, it was around the time of the  World Cup,” he recalls. “It was like our mid-season training.”Aside from work, football became an important part of Colms le. Lavey beat Newbridge in the  senior final but had the title stripped due to allegations of someone watching a soccer game during the ban on foreign sports.They went one better a year later with a - to - win over Pearses and the clubs championship tradition was up and running. For Colm Mulholland, his football career began in his early teenage years.“I started football when I was very young,” he begins. “The earliest memory I can think of was on a Lavey team, when someone didnt come and they were a man short.“Someone said theres a young boy Mulholland there and they filled out the team. I was about  and I played on the senior team.“Fr Carragher was a big man in the GAA at the time, he came to my house and asked my fatherI could to come and play a game.“I remember the game was played in Lavey and it was a time when a lot of people were going to games on bicycles. My father had one of the first cars in Lavey parish.”Lavey won championships in  and , but by the time Colm had become a regular senior, it was Newbridge who began to take root.“I was a young player coming up through with Lavey and enjoying my football. We werent winning all the time, but we were winning some things.“I had myself all prepared and like a lot of others, I was physically very fit. You werent worried about who you met.“At that time, Newbridge had a great side and were ruling the roost, they were winning everything.”Going into the s, Colm, the  Derry minor captain had established himself on the senior team and, locally, Lavey was beginning to flourish. In , they opened their hall. The following year, Lavey won the league and championship double and just missed out on the treble when Newbridge beat them in the final of the McGlinchey Cup.“I was the captain of the Lavey team that won the  championship,” Colm says proudly.With the lateTommy Doherty at centre-back, Colm was deployed on the  by manager John L Fay, who was ahead of his time as a manager, having taken the Lavey team to watch Banaghers North Derry final win over Dungiven two weeks before the county decider.The final was played in Dungiven and they went into the chapel to light a candle before the game and it had the desired effect. On a windy day, they beat Banagher - to - to secure the clubs fourth title. googletag.cmd.push  Colmcaptained Lavey to the  senior championship “It was a great le,” Colm said of his football career, having played with Lavey until around . “I must say that I enjoyed every bit of it. I played with some very good players in my time and came up against some very good players.”When Lavey became a force at the end of the s, his son Don was on the team. He played up front with Seamus Downey and Collie McGurk on the team that won the  All-Ireland.“That was a very proud moment, there is no doubt about that,” Colm utters.Don can remember the fitting moment when he was reunited with his father after their win over Salthill.“Daddy and uncle Seanwere there on the pitch and I can remember their joy,” he outlines. “It was like the feeling of at last weve won something in Croke Park and something signicant and a monkey off the back.”The irony was the that great friends from their Lavey and Derry days Colm and Short Tommys sons – Don and Damian – played in Laveys finest hour.It was the missing link, giving Derry the extra belief that Sam Maguire was in their grasp. Colm agrees.“It was a fantastic...and Henry Downey was a great player,” he endorsed of the man following in his own footsteps.“Lavey were always to the fore, with players on Derry teams,” added Colm, who was one of the standard bearers. *** When Derry won the first NFL title in , John L Fay was manager and while Colm was too young to play, he remembers that era clearly.Six points from captain Pat Keenan and a goal from Frankie Niblock, who lost three teeth in an earlier challenge, was enough to see off Clare.“Thatwas before my time with Derry but I can remember it very well. There were some of the greatest names to play Gaelic football on that team.”Three years later, Colm had broken into the county junior team who lost an All-Ireland final to Mayo. He lined out at midfield with Mickey McNaught, who was on the league winning team and Jim McKeever was listed at wing-forward. Tommy Doherty was stationed at full-back, in front of goalkeeper Charlie Moran.“I always remember them saying about Daddy being able to use both feet,” Don points out. “Thats why he played in so many dferent positions.”The junior team was for players who had not played in the senior championship during the season or the previous year.“Lesser teams have appeared in All-Ireland senior semi-finals since,” read a line for the  Derry centenary book, highlighting the strength of the  junior team.For Colm Mulholland, he just took all in his stride.“You just played the game and you didnt worry who you were playing against. You worriedyou lost andyou won it, you enjoyed it and that was the kind of le young people enjoyed.”When Derry lost their first Ulster final in , Colm was listed at corner-forward. They lost - to - to Cavan and the final to Tyrone two years later, but were no longer looked on as the soft touch in Ulster.“At that stage we all had great experience of county football. We had not won anything of great importance, but along came victory,” he said, referring to their  Ulster title and a first for the county.Early in the season, Colm was on the Derry team to play at the Wembley tournament before an attendance of , against Galway.Derry won both the Dr McKenna and Dr Lagan cups that season. In the championship, they were three-point winners against Antrim. After defeating Cavan in the semi-final, they were - to - winners against Down in the Ulster final.It took Derry back to Croke Park and a clash with a Kerry team who boasted greats such as Mick ODwyer and Mick OConnell.“That was a very big thing,” Colm states. “I remember it was a wet day and that was a much talked about game.”In dficult conditions, the Kingdom led - to -, but by half-time it was a dferent story and Derry were two points ahead.The Oakleafers went into a four point lead before Kerry grabbed a second goal to leave them holding on to win narrowly, - to -.“Beating Kerry in Croke Park was some achievement, there was over , people there. You were treated like royalty when you played on that Derry team and people wouldve kissed the ground you walked on.”  Colmat a Derry training camp at the airfield in Newbridge. His daughter Brid had it blown up and original hangs on the kitchen wall at home The final was a dferent story. Dublin led - to - at one point in the first half and after Derry found their feet, they trailed by four at half-time.A goal from Owen Gribbin levelled the game at - to -, but the Dubs found the net with a Des Ferguson goal in the next attack, putting them on their way to a - to - victory.“We shouldve won that All-Ireland,” Colm states.As the years have passed, several Derry supporters have felt aggrieved at not getting fair play. On an occasion, Don went to Dublin for a weekend. A conversation with a Dub over breakfast traversed towards football and eventually of his father playing in the  final.“I remember a Dublin man chipping in telling me we robbed you that day and that the refereewas an auctioneer in Dublin and he gave us everything that day...that was a Dublin man saying that. Anyone I have talked to and is old enough to remember, would say the same.”For Colm, when speaking of the final, there is a frustrated tone, but he just wants to forget about it.“It was a good team we had, but we dont want to hear about it again, thats how bad we all took it. I am just drawing a line under it.”He played for another three or four years before calling time on his Derry career, one he enjoyed immensely. It included the  league final defeat to Kerry, a game Colm excelled in.“I played football for Lavey and Derry for at least  years. I played for a long time and then golf took over after the football.”“I just loved it football and the people you would meet, then you went down South and they knew you played Gaelic football, there was always great chat.”Colm also had a prolonged spell in Philadelphia where he stayed with his uncle Dermot Glackin, a relation on his mothers side. He also had his fare paid to travel to play football in New Yorks Gaelic Park. While in the Big Apple he got approached about playing in San Francisco and drove thejourney of nearly , miles along the famed Route .“I was in America a few times. I was well looked after and it was a very interesting time,” he adds.In later le, in , he crossed the Atlantic with his we Mairead on San Francisco, where he also played golf.He would go on to captain Moyola Park in , but it was far from his first impact on the club.  Colm in his Moyola captains jacket *** In the early s, there was an attempt to bring golf to the South Derry area, but it wasnt until  that Lord Moyola made an approach about about constructing a course on the Shanemullagh Estate in Castledawson.On the first committee formed was Colm Mulholland who was contractor for the new course, putting his civil engineering work to good use. By the spring of , the front nine was complete before work moved to completing the rest of the course.“I built the course – the greens and the tees,” outlines Mulholland. Being at the coalface of making the dream into a reality is a source of pride for him. Moyola was his arena and there was even a hole called after him – Colms dillemna.Earlier in the day, before our telephone call, Colm amassed all his golfing trophies. It amounted to  or  from a career he thoroughly enjoyed. He also loves to tell of his part in a fourball that lost just twice over a  year period.“I enjoyed the golf and I played it in America and played a good bit in San Francisco. Later on in le, I had more success in golf than I had on the football field.”“You could write books galore about the acquaintances with people in the world of sport. I have played golf in  of the  counties, it was great to meet friends through it and the football. Sport is something .”The former Derry minor and Lavey senior winning captain is now an honarary club president. He is also an honarary member of Moyola Golf Club – titles not just handed out to anyone. They are earned through years of service.When the lock-down subsides, Colm will be back swinging the clubs again. You cant keep a good man down. RELATED - The foundations for Derrys GAA success.

At present, there are six people being treated at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry after testing positive for the disease. Geraldine McKay, the Western Trusts Director of Acute Hospitals, said that the number of COVID- patients at Altnagelvin was very reduced in comparison to what they have been. There have been  deaths from COVID- in recent months in the Western Trusts two acute hospitals at Altnagelvin and the South West hospital in Enniskillen. There have been further deaths in local care homes but a breakdown of deaths in inidual care homes has not been made public. googletag.cmd.push The Western Trust said that there had been COVID- outbreaks in  care homes in the Trust area. An outbreak is defined as two or more cases. Ms McKay said the lower than anticipated number of cases and deaths locally was due to the co-operation of the public and the magnicent work of healthcare staff. As part of the preparations for the expected rise in COVID- cases, the number of intensive care beds at Altnagelvin Hospital had been increased from  to . However, Ms McKay said the intensive care unit never had to work at full capacity over the recent period. googletag.cmd.push She said that the number of people attending Altnagelvins emergency department had decreased by almost % over recent months after people were asked to stay away from the hospital as much as possible to allow staff to cope with the COVID- situation. Ms McKay praised the public for their support for the health service and highlighted how well people locally had taken on board the message to stay at home and maintain social distancing when out in public. She said this had played a vital role in keeping the number of COVID- cases and deaths lower than had been anticipated. People have really done what we asked of them, she said. Ms McKay said the Trust was now looking at how to manage the new normal for hospital services, taking into consideration issues such as social distancing in waiting areas and the use of personal protection equipment for staff.

Robert Fullerton, who is , bought the pound ‘Treasure Bingo’ Scratchcard at his local Vivoxtra store whilst shopping for some essential grocery items on May . Little did Robert know that later the same evening he would discover he’d won an amount , times greater than the price of the scratchcard! The incredible news comes as an amazing boost for Robert and his we Susanas both had been recently furloughed from the company they work for as a result of the COVID- pandemic. googletag.cmd.push Robert works as a spray painter and Susan as a machine operator for a leading local kitchen supplier and, like many across the country, have been furloughed for the past five weeks as part of the Government’s job retention scheme. Robert explained how his le-changing win came about. “I was out doing an essential grocery shop and had a scratchcard in my pocket with a pound win on it. So while I was paying for the groceries, I exchanged it for another similar National Lottery Scratchcard, and bought an extra one for good measure. “I brought the two scratchcards home and played them that night. I didn’t win anything on the first scratchcard and gave it to Susan to check, while I was scratching the second card,” he continued. googletag.cmd.push “Half-way through, it was already showing that I’d won pound, and I started physically shaking. I was thinking to myself, ‘that’s not right’ and had to get up and go outside for some fresh air. “I showed the scratchcard to Susan and took a photo that I sent to my mum and sister – both of whom agreed that I wasn’t seeing things and that, as far as they could see, I’d won three hundred grand! “After a restless night, with little or no sleep, I called The National Lottery the following morning. They asked for some details and then, I’ll never forget, the lady on the phone said… ‘Congratulations, you have won pound,’! “My reply was ‘you what ’ My heart felt like it was going to burst out of my chest. In fact, I still can’t believe it. It’s like a dream come true, especially in these uncertain times when we’re stuck at home and don’t really know how our jobs will be affected by this coronavirus pandemic.” Despite his big win, Robert hopes to get back to work as soon as possible, saying that he loves his job and the ‘banter’ with his workmates. Robert bought the winning National Lottery Treasure Bingo Scratchcard from the Vivoxtra store on Magherafelt Road in Castledawson.

Guidelines remains in place from government asking citizens to stay at home as much as possible, and when outside of their home to follow social distancing rules and avoid any gatherings. Mayor Boyle said that while she understood that this continues to be a frustrating time for all, it is imperative that everyone follows the advice. The current circumstances are dficult for everyone, but its only through all of us playing our part that we can move closer to ato normality. googletag.cmd.push I have been very disappointed to learn that some people are trying to arrange events and gatherings locally and I would strongly discourage both the organisation and attendance of these. The advice from government is very clear – we must stay at home and, where it is necessary to go out, we have to take all possible precautions to protect ourselves, our families, our health service and everyone around us. We are in a crucial period of this pandemic and our actions now will have a huge effect on how the coming months will pan out. Despite all of our frustrations, this is not the time for complacency, therefore, I am asking each and every one of our citizens in the district to please keep following the guidelines and advice, and keep persevering. Together we will get through this so stay home, stay apart and stay safe. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At Tuesday night’s online council meeting, the council voted against topping up the extra % for the  employees currently facing furlough. The move has prompted scathing criticism from three trade unions who have called on the council to rethink their plans. Alan Law of NIPSA branded the decision ‘disgraceful’. “Council officers assured the Trade Unions that plans to furlough staff would be at % of normal pay and advised the unions that Councillors agreed with these plans,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “It is absolutely disgraceful that this decision was taken and is utterly opposed by NIPSA.” GMB’s Alan Perry said: “This appalling decision by councillors is another example of how they view the staff of this council. “To force a pay cut on some of the lowest paid workers isn’t acceptable when themselves still receive full pay and expenses.” Unite Regional Officer, Gareth Scott, said the decision was putting the funding at risk. He said: “This approach is not being taken by other councils, is totally unacceptable and the unions will be challenging the decision in every way possible. “Under the Job Retention Scheme the employer requires the agreement of the employees, as such the Councillors are actually threatening the chance to draw down this % funding from central Government.” googletag.cmd.push Sinn Feacutein’s motion proposed that the council top up the furloughed staff’s wages to %, but group leader on the council, Cara McShane, said unionist opposition caused it to fail. She said: “Sinn Feacutein believed that Council making up the remaining % of the employees’ salary was the right thing to do. “There is already an obvious and signicant savings for Council, which can now avail of % of these salaries from the government’s Job Retention Scheme. “Causeway Coast and Glens Council had the opportunity to show it was an organisation who had the workers’ interests at heart, but it failed again. “It is unfortunate, but not surprising, that the DUP and UUP joined forces to reject our proposal.” The DUP’s John McAuley said they opposed the motion ‘in the interests of fairness’. He said: “Unionists last night supported a proposal to Furlough a number of council staff who due to the current Cornovirus Crisis are not required. “This UK Government scheme pays % of normal wages and is designed to safeguard jobs, avoiding a redundancy situation. “SF supported by SDLP, Alliance  Cllr McShanevoted for council to top this up to to % but the amendment failed. “Our stance was nothing to do with financial mismanagement, but in the interests of fairness. Why should public sector furloughed workers get % when private sector are getting %  “Why should council staff get paid the same on Furlough as their colleagues who are still working as normal  “I know that majority of my constituents would not want their money being used to top up public sector wages whilst they are in the same situation on % pay.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sister Clare Crockett was just -years-old when she died in the stairwell of her school in Equador as she attempted to guide five girls to safety during an earthquake on April , . Since her death many people from across the world have begun praying to her and her grave in the City Cemetery has become a place of pilgrimage. In recent weeks, her photograph has been displayed in the windowsof homes across Derry, as people pray for her intercession during the coronaviruspandemic, googletag.cmd.push A novena prayer to Sister Clare Crockett, which was written by her holy order, ServantSistersof the Home of the Mother, is also said to be bringing great comfort during these uncertain times. Heranniversary mass was held by Carmelite Priest, Fr Stephen Quinn, at Termonbacca last month and was broadcast on its YouTube channel to over , people. People who havent been to mass in years tuned in to YouTube and Facebook to watch her mass, said Sean Gallagher, who helps run a novenaprayer group in her memory. Mr Gallagher and PatsyMcCallion decided to take her banner around ious churches in the city, whose doors remain closed due to the coronavirus crisis. googletag.cmd.push We took it up to Termonbacca to see Fr Stephen and then we went to see Fr Joe Gormley in St Marys in Creggan and then it just went on and on, explained Mr Gallagher. This year more than any other Sr Clare has been catapulted into the limelight. More people are praying to her than ever before. Before the coronavirus there was a woman who came all the way from Poland to visit Sr Clares grave. She said you just dontrealise how special this woman is. So many people are looking for her photograph and Novena we just cant print them fast enough. In recent weeks Sister Clares sisters, Shauna Gill and Megan Nicell, have travelled around the city delivering hundreds of photographs and novenas to houses and local shops. Sister Clare was a self confessed party girl with a promising show business career in front of her when she joined the ServantSistersof the Home of the Motherat just . Since her death several miracles have been attributed to her and calls have been made for her to be made a saint.The miracles are working all the time, said Mr Gallagher. We should be shouting from the rooftops about her. This is our saint - she was a wee woman from the heart of the Bog. I hope she is made a saint sooner rather than later. It is something that can take hundreds of years but I hope to see it in my letime. I was talking to a young woman recently who had a picture of Sr Clare in her window. I asked her about it and she said she got it from the chip shop in Rosemount. She told me I dont pray but I chat away to that wee nun every day. That is a small miraclein itself. At this time more than ever people are putting their faith in her. She is moving young people because she was so young.

The number of parcels being delivered is % more than this time last year, with the districtrsquos other foodbanks reporting an increased demand.In a newsletter issued last week, Mrs Lennon revealed that an application to the Martin Lewis Coronavirus Emergency Fund was successful and that the support the charity will receive will make a ldquosignicant dference to its work in the immediate future.She also said that many of the volunteers have begun to see food and its supply in a dferent way.ldquoThe panic buying, shortages and less opportunities to shop has had an impact on people who have never faced this situation before, continued Mrs Lennon.ldquoPersonally, I hope I understand a little more about the worry that feeding those we love can bringle becomes dficult. I have been so pleased that the foodbank has been able to continue operating in these dficult circumstances, even though it is operating dferently.Mrs Lennon said she is especially grateful to everyone who has helped her with decision making and practical help since the pandemic began.ldquoIt has been humbling and amazing to see God continuing to bless the work and to be able to help those in our community who need the support, she continued.Donations of food can be left at the Asda and SuperValu stores in Downpatrick during their opening hours andanyone would like to make a financial donation they can do so by email.There is also a weekly donation point for people in Saintfield at the townrsquos First Presbyterian Church between pm and pm. Donations can be made on Tuesdays between pm and pm.Partner organisations can still refer people to the foodbank for support either by telephone on   or by emailing fountainfoodbank@gmail, while iniduals who feel they need help can also contact the foodbank directly, providing some basic information. They can also order a food parcel.Mrs Lennon said that due to the very dficult circumstances at present, the foodbank is keen to help as many people as possible, urging them not to be anxious about asking for help.Orders need to be placed by pm on Tuesdays, with parcels delivered on Wednesday afternoons and left outside clientsrsquo homes.Across the district, many groups and iniduals are donating food and money to the foodbank to allow the volunteers to help those in need. They include BM Bargains in Ballynahinch, Crossgar Harriers, Omagh Stockcar Club, Downpatrick FC, Saintfieldrsquos Hollymount Hall and churches in the Saintfield area.Mrs Lennon said: ldquoWe are overwhelmed by the generosity shown by so many at this dficult time. Despite food being dficult to purchase, people are still making donations and many generous financial donations have been made.The foodbank volunteers hope that shoppers will continue to think about the charity when they are shopping and leave items at the dedicated collection points in local stores to help them continue to meet increasing demand.The Fountain Foodbank contact details are  , email fountainfoodbank@gmail or visit www.downpatrickpresbyterianchurch.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin man Chris makes vital PPE equipment  ","story":"AN Aughlisnafin man has taken his new lesaving charity venture to a higher level.Chris Campbell, is putting his passion for technology to good use by making PPE for care workers on the frontline of the coronavirus pandemic.Chris, who began making PPE from his home a little over a month ago, has been inundated with requests, so much so that he and his small team of volunteers have moved their operation to St Maryrsquos Community Hall in Newcastle.The premises were kindly offered to him by Rob Manley, founder of Newcastle Community Cinema, which has had to close due to the lockdown.By using D printers Chrisrsquos venture, PPE NHS Supplies NI, has so far supplied almost , high-quality sets of face shields and ear protectors to hospitals and nursing homes mdash and thatrsquos just the beginning.Chrishas been helped by generous cash donations by members of the public.He said: ldquoAt the beginning I received an anonymous donation of pound, which overwhelmed me and since then the donations have been pouring in. I am so humbled by the kindness of strangers.ldquoI set up a GoFundMe page that allows charity workers like myself to make instant withdrawals which means I can now purchase materials faster and produce the PPE without much delay.The more D printers that Chris can purchase the more lesaving equipment he can produce. However, costs are rising.ldquoThis week a D printer jumped to pound on eBay. The same printer last year cost pound. You could say they have all but tripled in price, he explained.Chris was diagnosed with ADHD when he was eight years old and has been greatly supported by the ADHD Hub in Newcastle.He says that once Covid- and the need for PPE ends, all funds from his venture will be donated to the Hub which is based in Savoy Lane.Chris says the condition is like a double-edged sword. While his le has been greatly impacted by ADHD, it can help him become a high achiever.ldquoSometimes people with the condition possess an exceptional ability to entertain, but there is always another side to it, he said.ldquoWe suffer from poor concentration levels in many areas and we have limited social skills. We miss out on the social subtleties that most other people take for granted and we are notoriously impulsive, which means school is a very hard environment for most of us.ldquoWhile we donrsquot make friends easily, wersquore exceptionally good at thinking outside the box. Nonetheless, it isnrsquot easy having thousands of thoughts running through your mind every moment, he said.Chris, who is happy to be producing high-end lesaving PPE, had this message for readers: ldquoIf you or a friend or family member are working for the NHS or any nursing home without the proper PPE please get in touch with me to arrange delivery or collection of the face shields and ear protectors.Alternatively you can help Chris fund his project by using the following link https:www.gofundme f d-printed-nhs-ppe-supplies-ni..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Club.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Youth salutes its young heroes  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Youthrsquos annual award winners have been announced.

I launched it at the school where I teach and it went down really well, everyone loved it.ldquoBut, sadly with many children loosing members of their family through Covid- the sales of the book have seen a resurgence.The Wizard and I tells the story of a young boy who visited a wizard at the bottom of his garden every time he needed advice.Ciaran added: ldquoThe wizard was always able to answer any questions the boy had, but one day the wizard wasnrsquot there. He then had to start answering questions for himself.ldquoThe boy in the story is myself as I go to visit my grandfather. The girl in the story is my daughter. When she arrives the boy has less time to spend with the wizard, explains Ciaran.ldquoAs a boy I always enjoyed spending time with my grandfather. I was like a sponge and would soak up his answers to my many questions.ldquoSome years later I got married and had a family and didnrsquot have as much time to visit my grandfather until one day he wasnrsquot there any more.Ciaran says the book, which was designed to bring about a conversation about the topic of dying, can benefit adults too.ldquoMy daughter also illustrated the book. When she heard the story she started to draw how she pictured it.

The homes are being built at a sprawling site which borders four main roads.The redevelopment of the former hospital site includes a range of housing types including apartments, two and three storey homes and bungalows.It is also understood that the former hospital and canteen building behind it, which are both listed buildings, have been incorporated into the development plan as apartment blocks.The main entrance into the former hospital complex, off Pound Lane, will remain, while itrsquos understood that a new entrance is also proposed on the Ardglass Road side of the old Downe site.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran is pleased that contractors are back on site and hopes they are observing social distancing guidelines.He said the redevelopment will go some way towards reducing the number of people on the waiting list for social homes in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThere are many families on the waiting list for social housing who are classed in the urgent need category which effectively means they are a priority for housing providers.ldquoPeople are watching construction work progress at the former hospital site and perhaps it may be possible for families to move into their new homes before the end of the year.Now that construction work has recommenced comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey confirmed that she is to introduce legislation designed to help protect the supply of new and existing social and affordable homes.She described housing as ldquoone of her priorities and said she has great ambitions to deliver more targeted to areas in the most need.ldquoTo do this, we must ensure we have the means to deliver, the minister continued, explaining that many of the changes required to existing legislation are technical in nature.Ms Hargey said the most signicant change will be an end to the compulsory need for registered housing associations to operate a house sales scheme.The minister said there will always be many challenges on the ability to deliver new social homes such as land availability, infrastructure issues and the availability of public finance, but outlined her commitment to doing all she can to deliver for those in need.Ms Hargey continued: ldquoI am committed to working with my Executivecolleagues to deliver more housing and welcome the priority afforded in the lsquoNew Decade, New Approachrsquo document which sets out how the Executivewill enhance investment and agree a new target for social and affordable home starts.ldquoFollowing the current coronavirus crisis, economic and social recovery will be vitally important for everyone. Whilst there are challenges ahead, a technicality should not stand in our way of delivery. This legislation will help to maximise the possible investment in a key public asset.Ms Hargey added: ldquoWithout a reversal of the classication decision the number of new social homes built each year would be reduced signicantly. It would also reduce access to the funding available for affordable housing through co-ownership..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Council Lead.jpg","title":"Council staff face furlough  ","story":"UP to  Newry, Mourne and Down Council staff could be furloughed as a result of coronavirus, it has emerged.It is believed that the move would save the local authority in the region of pound, a month, with suggestions that the organisation is currently ldquohaemorrhaging money due to a major loss of income.The local authority plans to utilise the job retention scheme with the majority of affected employees working in leisure centres, museums and arts, tourism and community facilities across the district.All these facilities have been closed since mid March as a result of the lockdown.The local authority has confirmed that it will make use of the coronavirus job retention scheme for employees who work in services where there has been a loss of income and who cannot be redeployed.The council is insisting that, at this stage, it does not know how exactly many employees will be impacted.It is understood that some politicians have been informed about the plans to furlough council staff and are confident the employees can retain their jobs when the ious centres and community facilities reopen.Politicians are also supportive of the councilrsquos senior management team for doing all it can to maintain key services during the pandemic and its key role in helping spearhead the community response on the ground.In addition, politicians say they recognise that prudent financial management is critically important in the current climate, given the challenges that lie ahead.News that up to  staff could be furloughed comes amid increasing concern that many local authorities across Northern Ireland that are losing hundreds of thousands of pounds each month may potentially have to look at reducing some services as a result of the pandemic.While many councils do not have major cash reserves, Newry, Mourne and Down Council is reported to be in a much healthier position than most.The Northern Ireland Local Government Associationmdash the umbrella body for the Provincersquos  councils mdash has warned of a ldquocash crisis for local councils as a result of the pandemic.The organisation said councils have gone beyond their remit, giving out , emergency food parcels and opening leisure centres to facilitate this operation.NILGA chief executive Derek McCallan said the organisation is expecting to see councils lose poundm in the non-payment of rates during the current financial year in addition to monthly losses.ldquoThat really points to one thing, cessation or a severe reduction in services, he continued.NILGA wants the Treasury to provide the same financial package it has have given English councils, which translates to around poundm for Northern Ireland. The organisation may also ask the Treasury to underwrite unpaid rates.Mr McCallan added: ldquoRecovery in many cases would be severely haltedthe very facilities and support to get the economy back again are severely restricted or donrsquot exist.Confirmation that Newry, Mourne and Down Council is using the furlough scheme comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey said her officials have been working with local authorities to understand the extent to which they can manage the Covid- situation by making use of the job retention scheme. She insisted that her priorities were ensuring that the rights of workers were respected and protecting jobs.The minister added: ldquoThis is a very dficult time for everybody. Our  councils provide very important s and services, continuing to do so during this emergency and looking ahead councils need to be ready to play their part in the economic recovery.A spokesman for Newry, Mourne and Down Council confirmed that the organisation will avail of the coronavirus job retention scheme.He explained that it will apply to employees who work in services where there is loss of income due to the Covid- pandemic and who cannot be redeployed to do other work.The spokesman added: ldquoThis falls in line with guidance from the Department for Communities.

This gaming  is an ever developing technology that makes training a lot more bearable and safer during those cold dark winter nights.With Zwt providing social rides, workouts, structured programmes and competitive racing, it has something for every cyclist mdash and, recently, runners too mdash all from the comfort of your home.So obviously when socialdistancing and lockdown struck, the footfall on Zwt rocketed. I suddenly noticed Shimna Wheelers numbers were increasing, from three or four of us to over a dozen.All were using it for dferent reasons. Alex McMath, Ronan Kelly, Jimmy McVeigh and myself were trying to maintain fitness and, with the aid of other apps, to socialise while riding and basically enabling a virtual club ride during lockdown. To fit in with family le these normally occur early morning or late evening.Along with Kieran Connolly, Brian McLornan and Andrew Porter, we are involved in racing leagues organised by Newry Wheelers and Cycling Ireland. The Cycling Ireland league races are broadcast live on Saturday mornings on YouTube.On the racing side, there has been plenty of banter between club members regarding weight and power. The races are seriously competitive, as they usually run in conjunction with other nationsrsquo leagues, and are pretty punishing on the body.Each of us knows our limits but with some choice words of encouragement via headphones during races, these limits can be surpassed. Jimmy is usually on the receiving end of the stick but generally backs it up in the races. Brian is beginning to settle into this new style of racing and improving with every outing.On our latest outing in the Newry League, only Kieran, Brian and myself made the start line and after a measured effort off the start we all ended up in the same group on the road, which was perfect.With the course being flat it was of utmost importance to stay in the draft of the group to preserve energy. Irsquom first to admit that both Kieran and Brian are much stronger riders than myself but with more experience on Zwt I was able to hang onto the group for longer than I expected.The three of us worked hard within the group, but with only six kilometres left we had slipped off the back of our group. I knew I was nearly done and with one last big effort Kieran and myself managed to close the gap to the group and Kieran and Brian were back in business.I was toast and reduced to riding to the finish alone, while the other lads were still firmly in the mix. They both had learnt their lesson and rode the last six kilometres well up in the group, covering every move.By the time the final sprint came Brian had recovered and shot out of the group to take the honours.Kieran rolled in a few places behind him, having succeeded in putting in a great sht during the whole race. I finished a couple of minutes down, but happy that I was able to help for a change. The next round will hopefully see a bigger Shimna turnout.Danny Carville, Barry Fettes, John Irwin and Marty McIlmail are involved in structured programmes and have found the daily training process very helpful during lockdown.One member, Brian Spence, is even using Zwt to recover from a skiing injury, while Lavelle Grant and Johnny Ward have just joined the ranks.Many other local clubs mdash such as Dromara, Newry, Killinchy, Ards and North Down mdash are experiencing similar interest due to the uncertainty of real cycling events this year.There is a lot of interaction between them and good communication, to the point that I believe it has made the whole Irish cycling community stronger and closer than it has been for a long time, helped mainly by the Zwt Community Team Irelandproviding a national sense of belonging in these dficult times.With riders from every county and of every ability itrsquos a credit to the likes of Alan Campbell, from Dromara, who has become heavily involved with the development of ZCTIrl, that this community is increasing daily.Of course Zwt is a global  and each country has its own community, but I believe that the Irish one is as strong as any in the world.Zwt is also being put to other good uses, with hundreds of people using the  to raise money for frontline services across the globe in this time of need.A few North Down members and myself helped raise more than pound, for the Ulster Hospital by riding the hardest course available on Zwt in around six hours. Painful, but well worth the effort.With the current situation worldwide, the cycling community is enjoying having some sort of sporting normality mdashyou call riding events with some of your heroes normality.The professional teams have followed suit and can be found riding around the same virtual world as us amateurs, training, racing and doing guest rides with their followers.There are not too many sports that can say that..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef cooks his way to final of Great British Menu  ","story":"DUNDRUM chef Alex Greene has booked his place through to the coveted  Great British Menu banquet.The  year-old stunned the judges on Monday nightrsquos finals competition with a potato-based dish starter dish inspired by Belfast-born CS Lewisrsquo The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe childrenrsquosrsquo book.Alex celebrated once more by picking up host, Susan Calman, and swinging her round ndash much to the comediennersquos delight.He first started off his culinary career as a  year-old washing dishes in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village.Having once worked in Claridgersquos in London and also run his own restaurant, Top Nosh, in Annalong, Alex ed to Deanes EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, where he had worked previously, and helped it retain its Michelin star for the fth year.His dish of onion jelly, pickled onions, five dferent types of potato, a four-cheese custard, and truffle, served in a wardrobe, was described by the judges as ldquoa sophisticated, sexy, sensual masterpiece.

They also claimed the existing plant in Killyleagh is operating well below capacity and can easely accommodate with sewage from Crossgar.But local councillors Sam Osborne and Albert Colmer have been highly critical of the DoErsquos attitude towards people in the Crossgar and Killyleagh areas and say that in a supposed era of open Government and accountability, the Departmentrsquos attitude is nothing short of ldquodeplorable and diabolical.ARDGLASS ndash A former primary school could be developed as a new community facility in Ardglass, it has emerged this week.Education chiefs say they are prepared to hand over the former Ardglass Primary School at the Downpatrick Road to the local Development Association after years of neglect.The school, which closed its doors over  years ago, was to have been developed as a new library facility, and while education chiefs claim this plan is not dead yet, they are prepared to allow the former school to be redeveloped by the local group.In addition, East Down Institute officials are understood to be interested in providing outreach classes in Ardglass and local councillor Dermot Curran says he is ldquodelighted there is now movement on the future of the old building.He has unveiled plans to hold an urgent meeting between the South Eastern Education and Library Board, the Ardglass Development Association, Down Council and the East Down Institute, to discuss a way forward.CLOUGH ndash An elderly woman was the victim of a terrying ordeal last week when masked men tied her up at her Clough home for four hours.The two intruders broke into the pensionerrsquos home at around .am on Sunday morning, tying her feet and hands before demanding money and then ransacking her house.The lady eventually managed to free herself at around am and sought help from a neighbour who reported the incident to police.

Only four of the nine entries went to post with Newcastle ride Tom Newsam setting off in the lead on his own Miss Lennihan, followed by Colin McBratney on Belle Lady, owned and trained at Strangford by Joe Magee.Belle Lady came down and victory went to Midnight Auburn, owned and ridden by Downpatrickrsquos Gerry Lavery, whose son, Declan, is one of todayrsquos top local amateur riders. Miss Lennihan took second as Paddy Fitzsimons had to pull up on Heatherrsquos Braes.The winner was trained by Gerryrsquos brother, Brian, who works for Jeremy Maxwell at Ballee.

This horse took part in the fourth race, the Andi Grand Prix qualier and, with Rathfriland jockey Leo Gracey in the saddle, made all at the running to come home four s clear of Glen Keys, ridden by Paul Larkan, and Bentra Road, ridden by Tom Howley. Frankie Fitzsimons was fourth on Davy Blackrsquos Anns Penny.The winner, making his debut, ran in the colours of Rathfrilandrsquos Sam McKee, better known as Uel, who told me not all that long ago, that they arrived at the track that day in a makesht horse box and parked beside some of the lorries from top stables.The East DownshireOpen Farmers Race went to Grange Valleyrsquo, owned and trained by former good amateur Ballymenarsquos Samy Patton and ridden by Robert Steele, who rode all his runners.

There are plans for sustainable transport projects including a park and ride scheme to bring visitors into the centre of the resort with the scheme similar to the one which operates during the resortrsquos international Festival of Flight.Cllr Clarke says the Gateway project encourages people to walk and cycle more and believes that the multi-million pound scheme can provide a signicant boost for the wider district economy.He said while people are rightly preoccupied with coronavirus at the moment, work is continuing to look at the future of tourism development across the region.He added: ldquoNewcastle can play its part and we all hope that the Gateway project will not only put the resort on the map, but wider South Down area. The scheme has the potential to create new hotel and retail development, creating jobs and boosting the economy.ldquoThe project is people-driven and providing facilities for them. It is also vital that was is created is used all-year-round, not just during the traditional tourism season. The focus is also in on making the most of the natural environment that we have in Newcastle and the surrounding area.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman said that the Belfast Region City Deal represents a major investment.He said in the Newry, Mourne and Down area, the investment proposals focus on the Mournes Gateway project and several schemes in the Newry area, including a city centre regeneration project, new theatre and conference facility and southern relief road.ldquoFunding is also being made available for digital infrastructure enhancements and enhanced skills and employability provision across the region, said the spokesman.He said the vision from the City Deal investment was to deliver inclusive growth, deliver up to , more jobs and increase the value of goods and services produced in the area by poundm annually..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Going.jpg","title":"Newcastle man’s extraordinary job post at the South Pole  ","story":"IMAGINE looking out of your kitchen window and seeing a humpback whale idly swimming by, or a small team of seals at play in the water.Therersquos snow and ice everywhere, animals outnumber humans, noise is completely muted but yet you have never felt more alive or connected to the world.Thatrsquos the extraordinary experience Newcastle man Kit Adams enjoyed when he took up a job offer which saw him as postmaster at the Port Lockroy research station on Goudier Island.Itrsquos located off the west side of the Antarctic Peninsula, more commonly known as the South Pole, and is one of the most remote places in the world.The  year-old mountaineer lived and worked with a small team of people over four months in what has become an important heritage site and a tourist destination for people who want to see the thriving penguin community.Employed by the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust, Kit handled the postcards sent by hundreds of holidaymakers on Antarctic cruises who visit the island and claim to have set foot on earthrsquos most southerly point.Back at his familyrsquos home in Newcastle, Kit has had time to reflect on what the experience meant to him.ldquoThe one thing that became clear to me is that itrsquos the type of environment that I want to spend more time in, said Kit, who coped with freezing temperatures of up to minus seven degrees fahrenheit.ldquoIt really affirmed what I thought I wanted to do, and thatrsquos spending more time in the polar regions. Itrsquos just so unique and dferent to Northern Ireland.ldquoWe have got the Mournes on our doorstep mdash thatrsquos what really got me into enjoying the outdoors. Growing up here, snow is always a novelty, which only comes every now and again. When it does, you try and make the most of it. Once I moved to university in Scotland, snow was much more regular thing and something I enjoyed.ldquoI definitely prefer the cold to the heat I canrsquot handle the heat at all to be honest. If you are somewhere cold, there is always something you can do about it mdash put on an extra layer mdash but in the heat I just struggle.A former pupil of Newcastle Primary School and Down High School in Downpatrick, Kit had been to the South Pole three times before he applied for the job at Port Lockroy. He made the application due to a recommendation from a friend who had already worked there.Kitrsquos academic background mdash he has a Geography degree from the University of Dundee and a Masters degree in Polar and Alpine Change from the University of Sheffield mdash made him a perfect fit for the job.ldquoGoing to Port Lockroy was such a unique opportunity that I jumped at the chance, he said.ldquoWhen we arrived last November, we couldnrsquot get onto the island as there was some sea ice. When we did get on, it was completely covered in snow. As the days went by, more rock was becoming exposed as the snow with the ice was melting. At the end of the season, there really wasnrsquot any snow left on the island.Despite being in what of the great expanses of ice and water on the planet, Kitrsquos world on the island suddenly became very small.ldquoThe island is really only the size of a football pitch and half of that is not accessible, he said.There is a Nissan hut where all the resident staff, and any visiting staff, live and work, a boat shed, which is a historic building, and Bransfield House, named after the Irish Antarctic sailor and explorer, Edward Bransfield. This houses the islandrsquos only shop, post office and museum.Kit explained: ldquoItrsquos quite a simplistic lestyle. There was no social media, no great phone connectivity, basic work emails, no running water or mains electricity, but it was nice to get away from wi-fi and it a quite peaceful le in many ways.ldquoYou are with the rest of the team [resident team of five], day in, day out,   on a tiny island and you need to be able to work and live in this small space with the same people every day. We had no means of getting off the island and had to do all our cooking, cleaning, etc. Therersquos quite a lot of work and maintenance to do and yoursquore always busy so you didnrsquot really have a lot of downtime. We got one day off in every .The high point for Kit was the stunning environment and being surrounded by all kinds of wildle.ldquoThere was loads of wildle, several penguin species such as the Gentoo, Chinstrap and Aediles, he said.ldquoYou can really see the penguins transition throughout the season. At the start they are gathering stones and building nests, by the end of the season, their new chicks are learning to swim. There are all sorts of flying birds like skuas, gulls, Southern Giant petrels, and cormorants. Sometimes you would see all kinds of fish, jelly fish, and ious types of seals and whales.ldquoYou could be washing the dishes and see a humpback whales outside. It was just ridiculous but absolutely wonderful at the same time.Spending Christmas at Port Lockroy was also special to Kit and the team as they had the pleasure of a day off and a chance of seeing the tiny island from a dferent perspective.Kit said: ldquoThere was a cruise ship nearby who kindly offered us a couple of kayaks. We manged to kayak around the island on Christmas day which was a great experience.While hersquos happy to be home with his family mdash dad Colin, mum Janette and brother Nick , who is also back home having left his former job in the Swiss Alps mdash Antarctica still has its hold over Kit.ldquoSimply being there is something that I do miss but the people I was there with were truly wonderful and I got on fantastically well with them, he says. ldquoItrsquos a bit strange being with them for so long and then everyone just goes their separate ways.ldquoEverything is up in the air at the moment but I really would love to go back..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Soccer.jpg","title":"Soccer over  ","story":"THE local soccer season has come to an end with unfinished business left on the books.Amateur League and Newcastle League officials have brought their seasons to a juddering halt without promotion and relegation issues being decided.Both leagues made their decisions after consulting with their clubs and although no one goes up and no one goes down, there are clear winners and losers.In the Amateur League the biggest losers are Ballynahinch Olympic, who were bidding to become champions of the Premier Division for the first time.They had an eight-point lead at the top of the table when football was suspended two months ago, although nearest rivals Crumlin Star and East Belfast had plenty of games in hand.Also on the losersrsquo list are Dromara Village, who were lying third in Division A and vying for promotion to the top flight.The biggest winners are Drumaness Mills, who have been spared relegation from the Premier Division, despite being rock bottom without a point to their name.Also saved are Downpatrick FC, who were eight points adrt at the bottom of Division A, and Ballynahinch United, who were at the foot of Division A and odds-on to make the .The only section to have an outcome is in Division C where top of the table Rosemount have been promoted.

Whatever measures the government have put in place ndash and they were very quick to take action and order a lockdown and introduce testing ndash they seem to have worked.Gareth said they were concerned like everyone  about the outbreak, but reckoned that they would put themselves at more risk taking a flight home.He said: ldquoOnce all this happened, we did have the conversation with our families about whether or not we should go home, but to be honest, regarding all the news headlines that we have been reading about home and the rest of the UK, we weighed everything up and it seemed that the situation was much worse in the UK and Ireland.ldquoAs we were able to still continue with our jobs, it seemed staying was the best and safest solution for us.The Australian government, along with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Prime Minister Boris Johnston, this week announced plans to phase down current lockdown restrictions over the coming weeks and months.

He occupied the role of secretary for the first season. Anyone that knew John would say he was first and foremost a football man.Having moved to Newcastle with his we, Josie, John soon became involved in the local football scene and went on to manage Newcastle FC.Many of us remember John playing in the old Summer League in the s for the Castlemac team and his team mates calling him Dixie after the great Everton striker Dixie Dean.A le-long Tottenham Hotspur supporter you would have thought John had a big enough cross to bear before he got involved in starting a new football club in his adopted town.A chance discussion in the summer of  led to John calling a meeting and from it Tollymore United was formed. Very soon the club appointed a manager, Clarence Robinson, and within a matter of weeks club had signed a host of players and started training.With Clarence and Sean Lavery looking after the playing side of things, John and his committee started planning off the field. The clubrsquos first presentations dinner was held in May , in the Central Park, with Northern Ireland legend Derek Dougan the guest of honour. Some of the clubs older members still talk about that night.Another first was the clubrsquos annual Christmas party for children, with John acting as Santa, and such was its popularity that committee members frequently had to rush down to the shops for more selection boxes.The club was now starting to establish itself more off the pitch than on it and the big name guests continued to arrive at the clubrsquos annual awards nights. Manchester United legend Tommy Docherty came in , Denis Law in , Liverpool legend Tommy Smith and Everton and Forest star Duncan Mackenzie in , and so it went on with John in his absolute element with Josie at his side.As the playing side of things began to improve there was nobody prouder than John when, in May , the club beat Ballycam Celtic in a play-off to win the Mourne Observer Cup and gain promotion to the Newcastle leaguersquos Premier Division.The merry-go-round of legends continued with Billy Bremner in  and the biggest name of all, Jack Charlton, arriving in  with John, proud as punch, appearing in the Belfast .In  the club had a fantastic season reaching the final of the Co Antrim Junior Shield only to lose - after conceding a golden goal. John, along with everyone , was gutted, but anyone who had been in Quinnrsquos that night would never have believed the Bears had lost.The following year the club lted the Rathmourne Cup with the second team winning the Purdy Cup and players and supporters lting the roof off the Donard Hotel in the company of Liverpoolrsquos Ian St John. What a night that was with John filling the Rathmourne Cup several times and rumours that Pete Law was required to repair the cup after a raucous night have never been confirmed or denied.Christmas  saw the Bears lting the Bobby Dalzell cup and another crazy awards night took place in the company of Emlyn Hughes.While football played a huge part in Johnrsquos le, he was very much a family man. Josie was a constant by his side at every club dinner and to everyone that knew them they were like a double act mdash terric company and great craic.John suffered a loss when his beloved Josie died, but his love of his grandchildren helped him through that dficult period. He was immensely proud of his daughter, Joanne, and loved nothing better than bringing his grandson, Callum, down to Friday night football.It was fitting that the club was able to hold its th anniversary dinner last year in the Slieve Donard Hotel where John previously worked as bar manager. John took his seat with son-in-law Mark alongside Liverpool legend Bruce Grobbelaar and it was like the good old days with John once more in his element welcoming guests and posing for pictures.It most have taken a huge effort on his part to attend but he would certainly not have missed it for anythingThe Tollymore United club, committee, players, coaches and supporters would like to offer their sincere condolences to Johnrsquos daughter Joanne, son-in-law Mark, grandchildren Callum, Clara, Alana and Harry, his sister Anne, nieces and nephews.

The republican propaganda machine never ceases and those ‘alert’ will understand the current stance employed by Sinn Fein in pursuit of their objective which is of course the total negation of Northern Ireland and its constitutional position as part of the United Kingdom.The treatment and narrow mindedness of those who castigated Sean Cavanagh for stating the fact that he was in the UK gives further insight into the minds of those who most likely support Sinn Fein.In her letter Mary Lou Mcdonald’s opening statement seems to me to be a carefully selected piece of propaganda “the health and well being of all who inhabit this island” and is worth pondering. Sadly, Irish republicans would have had dficulty in making a statement of this nature during the  years campaign of murder and bloodshed when human le was rendered expendable in pursuit of ‘the cause’.Everything British is an offence to a certain type of republicanism and that is why I for one will not sit down and negotiate away my British citizenship.

By its nature, angling is a solo sport or hobby, and its participants can enjoy a day’s fishing without being in close contact with others.”Mr Poots added: “The sport has huge benefits for people’s mental and physical well-being and in this time of uncertainty, I know that many people have missed the solitude and peace that angling and being outdoors with nature, brings them.

The borough’s five other sitesare to reopen at an unspecied later date. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Addressing this plan, the Director acknowledgedthat the Executive’s announcementhad changed the nature of the debate.“There was an announcement this afternoon [Thursday] from the Executive that said travelling to recycling centres is, from Monday, an appropriate reason for travel,” said Mr Parkinson.“With that in mind, what I would suggest to members is that we progress with the proposed model initially. However in the following days, we work to open the other five sites shortly afterwards.”Addressing the issue SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon asked that this matter be dealt with under scheme of delegation in order to ensure that recycling centres can be opened promptly.He also asked that Council’s bulky waste collection service be “restarted in tandem” with the reopening of recycling centres and queriedhow recycling centres could cater for those who are shielding.His comments were address by Council’s ChiefExecutive, Roger Wilson, who said party group leaders had made their “desire to get centres open as quickly as possible” clear.He also said it would be a “matter of practicality”the decision were to remain under delegationas this would “remove the element of having to go through a call in period”.Council’s Strategic Director, Mark Parkinson, said he would agree with Councillor O’Hanlon “on the point about bulky waste collection restarting at the same time” as recycling centres reopen.Ulster Unionist Party councillor, Julie Flaherty, commendedthe “fantastic job” waste men and women are doing across the borough and said her party would support steps to reopen these centres quickly and safely.The Alliance Party’s Cllr Eoin Tennyson asked about PPE for staff and was informed by Mr Parkinson that the council has a sufficient supply of PPE.The Director also informed Cllr Tennyson that Council is meeting with unions “every morning” to make sure “the equipment is reaching the right people” and the supply of this equipment is “reviewed on a regular basis”.Councillor Darryn Causby welcomed the fact Council can now “get these centres open” and asked what type of material would be accepted at that start.He was informed by Mr Parkinson that in line with the initialproposal the sites will accept “black bags and general waste until processors are back up and running” and that “over a period of time, we will expand the waste cycle”.Independent Councillor Paul Berry called for a “common sense approach” to allowing certain trailers access to recycling centres.“Some areas across this borough, do not have a brown bin for their garden waste and I think their needs to be a common sense approach towards letting some trailers with garden waste have access to these sites,” said Cllr Berry.Lord Mayor, Councillor Mealla Campbell, agreed with this point. However, the Council’s Strategic Director explained that restricting sites to cars and black bags only is an attempt to deal with an expected initialpeak in demand.“We will get a vast number of people looking to bring black bags and access the centres,” said Mr Parkinson. “We are limiting it to cars initiallyto manage capacity. Once we are over that peak, and we expect that to be within a few days, we can look at allowing access to trailers and white vans.“In regards to smaller sites, the other thing to consider is their size,we get the demand we expect, we will be forced to close them again very very quickly as they will be at capacity.”DUP group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter said he was concernedthatsmaller sites were not opened quickly, residents in those areas could feel “short changed”.His party colleague Alderman Gareth Wilson, said this issue was one the general public are “engaged with” and are aware that it is a service that can be offeredwith “social distancing kept in place”.He also said Council needs to be very careful about getting the message across about what type of material can be accepted at these centres.This view was agreed with by DUP Alderman Paul Rankin who said thatany announcementwas to be made, Council would need to “give a timeframe or specydetails on when the other five sites are going to open”.SDLP Councillor Thomas Larkham enquired about the openingtimes for the four main centres and was told they would open from Monday – Friday am to pm, initially, in line with the report presented to members.It was also made clear, following a query from SDLP Councillor Eamon McNeil, that a special time slot for NHS and other care staff would be in operation on Saturday mornings from am to  noon.DUP Councillor Margaret Tinsley then asked that Saturday opening hours be extended to allow all those back at work to access to the sites.An announcementon the issue is expected from Council tonight , following a party group leaders’ meeting where the issues raised during the debate will be discussed.Adam Morton , Local Democracy Reporting Service\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Image © National Army Museum.Florence Nightingale – Nursing and Midwery  Years was originally set to open at the Ulster Museum in March before social distancing measures were introduced.Its launch as a digital exhibition coincides with the th year anniversary of Florence Nightingale’s birthand International Year of the Nurse and Midwe .The special exhibition explores the vital work of nurses and midwives through two centuries of nursing, covering themes such as nursing in wartime, nursing during The Troubles, and nursing education and innovation in Northern Ireland. It also features an original voice recording of Florence Nightingale.Since the lockdown began, National Museums NI has been working to digitise the exhibition and make it accessible to the public.Kathryn Thomson, Chief Executive of National Museums NI, said: “Over the past couple of months our colleagues at National Museums NI have been working hard to find new and innovative ways to make our collections engaging and to reach audiences safely.“During these dficult times it’s important to maintain access to the arts and culture and this latest show represents our first fully digital exhibition.

However, over the past few weeks clarityhas been provided by Ministers through a set of guidelines which it is suggested, should be address prior to any formal decision to reopen being made.As such council officers have proposed an initialoperating model to see the borough’s four main sitesreopen.The report states that services at these premises would be availableto the general public on weekdays from am to pm.A Saturday morning slot would,these recommendation are approved by Council, be available only for health care and associated workers.It is also suggested that initiallywaste is limited to black bag and potentially green waste and that only cars are to be permitted.The need to limit the reopening to the four main recycling initially, is, the report claims, “based on a mix of waste product capacity and maximising the use of key staff ”.The report concludes by stating that the implementation of this model is dependant on Council’s abilityto redeploy staff and on the speed at which waste operators could get their service operational, ensuring that the vehicles are road worthy.Given these considerations the report suggests it may take up to five working days from a decision being made to the actual reopening of the four sites.This issue is due to be debated at tonight’s virtual council meeting.The meeting is set to get underway at .pm and members of the public can watch the debate by clicking hereA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The borough’s five other sitesare to reopen at an unspecied later date.Addressing this plan, the Director acknowledgedthat the Executive’s announcementhad changed the nature of the debate.“There was an announcement this afternoon [Thursday] from the Executive that said travelling to recycling centres is, from Monday, an appropriate reason for travel,” said Mr Parkinson.“With that in mind, what I would suggest to members is that we progress with the proposed model initially. However in the following days, we work to open the other five sites shortly afterwards.”Addressing the issue SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon asked that this matter be dealt with under scheme of delegation in order to ensure that recycling centres can be opened promptly.He also asked that Council’s bulky waste collection service be “restarted in tandem” with the reopening of recycling centres and queriedhow recycling centres could cater for those who are shielding.His comments were address by Council’s ChiefExecutive, Roger Wilson, who said party group leaders had made their “desire to get centres open as quickly as possible” clear.He also said it would be a “matter of practicality”the decision were to remain under delegationas this would “remove the element of having to go through a call in period”.Council’s Strategic Director, Mark Parkinson, said he would agree with Councillor O’Hanlon “on the point about bulky waste collection restarting at the same time” as recycling centres reopen.Ulster Unionist Party councillor, Julie Flaherty, commendedthe “fantastic job” waste men and women are doing across the borough and said her party would support steps to reopen these centres quickly and safely.The Alliance Party’s Cllr Eoin Tennyson asked about PPE for staff and was informed by Mr Parkinson that the council has a sufficient supply of PPE.The Director also informed Cllr Tennyson that Council is meeting with unions “every morning” to make sure “the equipment is reaching the right people” and the supply of this equipment is “reviewed on a regular basis”.Councillor Darryn Causby welcomed the fact Council can now “get these centres open” and asked what type of material would be accepted at that start.He was informed by Mr Parkinson that in line with the initialproposal the sites will accept “black bags and general waste until processors are back up and running” and that “over a period of time, we will expand the waste cycle”.Independent Councillor Paul Berry called for a “common sense approach” to allowing certain trailers access to recycling centres.“Some areas across this borough, do not have a brown bin for their garden waste and I think their needs to be a common sense approach towards letting some trailers with garden waste have access to these sites,” said Cllr Berry.Lord Mayor, Councillor Mealla Campbell, agreed with this point. However, the Council’s Strategic Director explained that restricting sites to cars and black bags only is an attempt to deal with an expected initialpeak in demand.“We will get a vast number of people looking to bring black bags and access the centres,” said Mr Parkinson. “We are limiting it to cars initiallyto manage capacity. Once we are over that peak, and we expect that to be within a few days, we can look at allowing access to trailers and white vans.“In regards to smaller sites, the other thing to consider is their size,we get the demand we expect, we will be forced to close them again very very quickly as they will be at capacity.”DUP group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter said he was concernedthatsmaller sites were not opened quickly, residents in those areas could feel “short changed”.His party colleague Alderman Gareth Wilson, said this issue was one the general public are “engaged with” and are aware that it is a service that can be offeredwith “social distancing kept in place”.He also said Council needs to be very careful about getting the message across about what type of material can be accepted at these centres.This view was agreed with by DUP Alderman Paul Rankin who said thatany announcementwas to be made, Council would need to “give a timeframe or specydetails on when the other five sites are going to open”.SDLP Councillor Thomas Larkham enquired about the openingtimes for the four main centres and was told they would open from Monday – Friday am to pm, initially, in line with the report presented to members.It was also made clear, following a query from SDLP Councillor Eamon McNeil, that a special time slot for NHS and other care staff would be in operation on Saturday mornings from am to  noon.DUP Councillor Margaret Tinsley then asked that Saturday opening hours be extended to allow all those back at work to access to the sites.An announcementon the issue is expected from Council tonight , following a party group leaders’ meeting where the issues raised during the debate will be discussed.Adam Morton , Local Democracy Reporting Service\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "}]
