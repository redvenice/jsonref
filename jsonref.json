They had taken their battle all the way to the Supreme Court.Knowing it was soon to become a legal possibility, our interest was piqued. Like Steinfeld and Keidan, we love and are committed to each other, but didn’t want to get married.         Hilary, who has been married once before, said the partnership is simpler, cleaner and more honest. She claimed: \u0027Weddings have become such overblown exercises in consumerism — all about the party, not the relationship\u0027We had our personal reasons: Mickael has never seen the point of marriage. His parents were orced, and his mother has lived with his stepfather for 30 years. I have been married before — a big wedding at the London Palladium in 1998 — and went through a long and tortuous orce 13 years later, which, I’ll admit, has made me cynical about the whole institution.Also, I didn’t want Mickael to become my ‘second husband’, an expression that makes it sound as if he’s the runner-up, less somehow than the first. I also wished to to differentiate this relationship from my marriage, as something distinct.So we chose a civil partnership, as a way to formalise our relationship without all the baggage and ritual that comes with a wedding.          Her mother\u0027s name and occupation would appear on the certificate unlike a traditional marriage certificate which only shows the father\u0027s. This \u0027antiquated nugget of sexism\u0027 is  separates the two types of ceremony and makes Hilary view civil partnerships even more favourably A civil partnership seemed simpler, cleaner, more honest, not to mention cheaper (the whole thing has cost us £225). Weddings have become such overblown exercises in consumerism — all about the party, not the relationship. We also wanted our guests to be there without having to worry about buying a new outfit, or a gift.Civil partnerships have no religious associations, which suits atheist me and secular Mickael, and no patriarchal ones. There was no expectation that I would take Mickael’s surname, or that anyone would ‘give me away’ — a ridiculously outdated notion, especially as I’m 48 years old and haven’t lived in my parents’ home for 30 years.Also, my mother’s name and occupation would appear on the certificate, not just my dad’s: an antiquated nugget of sexism still attached to the traditional marriage certificate, which should have been changed years ago.         Mikael (pictured signing the agreement) \u0027didn\u0027t see the point to marriage\u0027 and present Hilary with a ring on Christmas Eve last year. She has agreed to wear it on the third finger of my left hand, which is said to connect with the heartWe registered our interest in a civil partnership ceremony with Camden Council and less than an hour later, I received an unexpected phone call from a chirpy registrar.‘How would you like to be one of the first and do it on New Year’s Eve?’ she asked. ‘Assuming, that is, that the law goes through the House of Lords in time.’Surprised, I replied: ‘Why not?’ The law did go through and so, on December 2, we were invited to give our notice — the required 29 days before the ceremony, so the news of our impending non-nuptials could be inscribed on a board.I’m told that seven other couples held their ceremonies in Camden yesterday, with a further 12 booked in so far. But the Government estimates there could be as many as 84,000 ceremonies countrywide in 2020 — which sounds a lot until you realise it’s only a tiny fraction of the 3.3 million cohabiting couples in the UK.Still, I managed to feel sentimental about our special day.Mickael and I met nine years ago in Nice, in the South of France, and have lived together in London for almost six years.While many people see getting married as a new chapter, an adventure, neither Mickael nor I felt the need to transform our relationship. We’re happy as we are. For us, having a civil partnership meant cementing what we already had, formalising it, not changing it into something new.         The Government estimates there could be as many as 84,000 ceremonies countrywide in 2020 — which sounds a lot until you realise it’s only a tiny fraction of the 3.3 million cohabiting couples in the UKUltimately, though, we decided to have a civil partnership because we felt we didn’t really have a choice. Marriage may be going out of fashion, with half as many couples tying the knot as 80 years ago, but, contrary to popular belief, there is no such thing as common-law marriage. That means cohabiting couples have no rights in the UK.Had we split up, or had one of us died, we would have been faced with a legal and administrative nightmare, with no automatic rights to inheritance or bereavement benefits or pensions, and no tax relief. We felt we had to protect our little family.Trying to explain the concept to our daughter, Sidonie, was tricky, though. Four-year-olds have conservative views, so she naturally assumed that, as her parents, we were married already. And, not having been to a real-life wedding, she can only imagine them as a fairytale, with a prince marrying a princess in a castle, after he’s fitted her with a glass slipper.So the idea of getting on the bus to go to a council building didn’t quite compute.‘It’s like a wedding but it’s not a wedding,’ I offered. The ‘not-a-wedding’ bit stuck and she started talking about it over the following days. ‘I can wear this to your not-a-wedding, can’t I, Mummy?’ she would say. And, ‘Are Grandma and Grandad coming to your not-a-wedding?’Although we chose, mainly for Sidonie’s sake, to have a no-frills ceremony with vows to be ‘loving and faithful’ and traditional ‘I wills’ (you can have a standard ceremony based on a civil marriage, or write your own), it wasn’t necessary.While a marriage is solemnised by saying legally prescribed words, for a civil partnership you merely have to sign a legal document in front of two witnesses — which is, frankly, about as romantic as making a will. We didn’t need a ring, either, but I’m not one to turn down a gift of jewellery, and it felt right. The ring I picked, gold with three intertwined circles, is both simple and quirky, a symbolic of our union. It’s not an engagement ring or a wedding ring, but I have agreed to wear it on the third finger of my left hand, which is said to connect with the heart.         The bride enjoyed the fact there was no expectation that she would take Mickael’s surname, or that anyone would give her away, a notion which she dubs \u0027outdated\u0027, as she said she has lived at her parents\u0027 home for 30 yearsUnexpectedly, Mickael got down on one knee to present it to me on Christmas Eve 2018, in France, in front of his family. I must confess, the romance of his gesture made me happier than I would have anticipated.Never fond of convention — even at my actual wedding ceremony, in 1998, I opted for a red velvet beaded dress rather than a bridal white one — I found choosing what to wear for our ceremony quite difficult. Furthermore, just a week after Christmas, I was still the shape of a mince pie.         The couple, happily married with a four-year-old daughter, said some people still cannot grasp what a civil partnership entailsUsually I’ll find any excuse to buy a new frock but I didn’t want to get too dressed up, especially as I’d made it clear to our guests that this wasn’t a formal occasion. On the other hand, wearing jeans and a jumper or something equally casual felt wrong, as if I was making a mockery of the event. In the end I chose a long printed dress, a favourite I’ve had for years.People’s reactions to our decision have ranged from delighted to bewildered to outright critical of us for being awkward or contrary. Some have treated it just like a wedding and heartily congratulated us, while others haven’t known what to say or even asked why on earth we’ve done it, as if it’s some sort of affront.When people say ‘I hope you’ll be very happy together’, I have to answer: ‘We already are. It won’t change anything.’Very few people seem to grasp what it entails, or how it differs from marriage. To be fair, there isn’t much difference. Originally designed in 2004 for gay couples, who weren’t legally allowed to wed for another decade, civil partnership grants the same rights.One distinction is that you can’t annul a civil partnership on grounds of non-consummation, or because one partner has a venereal disease — which, to be honest, I didn’t realise was grounds (I guess people don’t admit to it nowdays, thank goodness).         Mickael and Hilary met nine years ago in Nice, in the South of France, and have lived together in London for almost six years. The 48-year-old mother said she picked a simple gold ring with , three intertwined circles as it was \u0027both simple and quirky, a symbolic of our union\u0027The other difference is that you can’t use adultery as a reason for dissolving a civil partnership, and it’s called a dissolution order rather than a orce.Otherwise, ending a civil partnership follows the same legal processes and procedures as orce, requiring a period of legal separation or the establishment of the breakdown of the relationship, with reasons, and is just as beset by difficulties and problems. And although I very much hope I never have to use it, it’s a real shame that the orce law wasn’t reformed before civil partnerships came into being.The Office for National Statistics figures suggest gay civil partnerships are less likely to be dissolved than marriages, perhaps because couples who choose to have them have already been together for a long time. Nobody yet knows if the same will be true for mixed- sex civil partnerships.Since same-sex marriage became legal in the UK in 2014, there has been a significant reduction in the number of civil partnerships, with gay couples now preferring to marry instead. It is conceivable, therefore, that in the future, civil partnership will become something mainly chosen by opposite-sex couples.         They merely had to sign a legal document in front of two witnesses on their special dayCertainly, the semantics around civil partnerships need some fine tuning. What do you call it? Getting ‘civilly partnered’ is a mouthful and sounds as if you’re going into business with your love, not committing yourself and all your worldly goods to them.At our notice-giving appointment, even the registrar kept getting it wrong and saying ‘When you get married’.As for what to call Mickael, I joke that he is my ‘sometimes civil partner’ I wish there was a better word.

They noticed a few things about Joseph Henry Loveless\u0027s life didn\u0027t seem to add up. His gravestone was actually a cenotaph, a stone with his name on it but no body buried underneath.Loveless\u0027s second wife, Agnes Octavia Caldwell Loveless, was killed with an ax on May 5, 1916, by a man named Walt Cairns, according to news articles and a wanted poster created by local law enforcement at the time.But according to another local news article on Agnes\u0027 funeral, one of her children said that it was his father in jail for the murder, not Walt Cairns. The child also remarked that his dad would be escaping soon because he never stayed in jail long.The DNA Doe Project team eventually unraveled the truth: Joseph Henry Loveless was born December 3, 1870, in the Utah Territory to Mormon pioneers. He married twice - his first wife Harriett Jane Savage orced him for \u0027abandonment,\u0027 according to Salt Lake City court records - and became a bootlegger, counterfeiter and general outlaw in Idaho.         Loveless\u0027s second wife, Agnes Octavia Caldwell Loveless, was killed with an ax on May 5, 1916Loveless used a variety of aliases during his criminal career, including Walt Cairns, Charles Smith and other variations of his given and phony names. He was also notorious for escaping custody, Bingham Redgrave said, sawing through jail bars with a blade he kept in his shoe and once managing to stop a moving train that he was being transported on to flee law enforcement.Investigators believe he died shortly after he escaped from the St. Anthony jail on May 18, 1916, where he was being held for Agnes\u0027 murder.\u0027It\u0027s blown everyone\u0027s minds,\u0027 Bingham Redgrave said of the investigation. \u0027The really cool thing, though, is that his wanted poster from his last escape is described as wearing the same clothing that he was found in, so that leads us to put his death date at likely 1916.\u0027Loveless\u0027 descendants were unaware of their ancestor\u0027s sordid past, so at this point there\u0027s not much more to go on besides speculation when it comes to the identity of Loveless\u0027 murderer.Still, with the Clark County Sheriff\u0027s Office keeping the case open as a homicide investigation, more clues may turn up yet.\u0027Who knows? Someone might recognize that name and say, `Oh, let me look at the old family photos.´ Someone may find something, an old news story, that isn\u0027t digitized,\u0027 Bingham Redgrave said. \u0027I\u0027m really excited to see what else comes out.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Up 4 000 troops ordered prepare rapid deployment Middle East","story":"Share this articleRudaw English on

It was a radical, unintended act, born of failed negotiations and it entirely disregarded the people of Scotland and Ireland. The surviving details are piquant and shaming: Charles I in two shirts so as not to betray shivered fear on a cold day, a masked executioner in a wig and false beard, a collective groan from the crowd.This used to be the moment when the curtain dropped. After an interval, or interregnum, in which Oliver Cromwell assumed power and killed all joy, the Stuarts returned for the second act, Charles II: the merry monarch. His reign was backdated to his father’s death and an Act of Oblivion drew a line under the horrid business of republic and civil war. As Paul Lay demonstrates in his immensely stimulating study of Cromwell’s Protectorate, this simply will not do. This was one of the most extraordinary, exhilarating, innovative and anxiety inducing periods in British history. There is no better time to be looking at it.The providence of Lay’s title is the lodestone Protestant belief that God in his mystery had a hand in all things. Nothing could happen, not salvation, nor a sneeze, without ine direction. This made the hotter sort of Protestants, the Puritans, off-balance and twitchy for approval, like social media addicts, Lay observes. None was more hooked on providence than Cromwell, a yeoman farmer from Cambridgeshire (and kinsman of Henry VIII’s minister), who had risen through the ranks of the army to take effective charge of Whitehall and Westminster.Providence is also a volcanic island in the Caribbean and it is here that the book opens, on Christmas Eve 1629, with idealistic Puritans hoping to settle a godly colony. They failed, largely because they refused to trade with Spaniards, but the vision endured, as did its backers, including key players in the Long Parliament that went to war with the king. At the battles of Naseby, Marston Moor and the “crowing mercy” of Worcester, God blew and the royalists were scattered. Providence justified the abolition of the monarchy and the House of Lords, just as it explained Cromwell’s clean sheet of victories. After his seemingly miraculous defeat of the Scots at Dunbar in 1650, he was seen laughing excessively “as if he had been drunk his eyes sparkled with spirits”.Others thought he was high on hubris. In December 1653, having forcibly dissolved two parliaments, Cromwell accepted the title of Lord Protector, which was written into a constitution known as the Instrument of Government. It was resisted by the first protectorate parliament and so, in a constitutional contortion that might make even today’s politicians blush, Cromwell dissolved parliament by counting its minimum period in lunar months, rather than the conventional, longer, calendar months. “I speak for God and not for men,” he told MPs. He was beginning to sound a lot like Charles I.Cromwell’s fundamental goal was liberty of conscience, but his challenge was to keep his army standing, deliver strong and stable government (“healing and settling”) and shape the people into a nation worthy of Christ’s imminent return. In that great gross line, he described the English as “under circumcision, but raw”. Above all, he strained to hear God’s voice once the guns had fallen silent.The answer, he decided, was global. He would take God’s fight back to the Caribbean, seize the island of Hiiola, avenge the loss of Providence and return with enough bullion to pay the army. The expedition commander was so buoyed by the venture that it doubled as his honeymoon. He returned to Portsmouth “almost a skeleton” and was dispatched to the Tower of London. The “Western Design” was an abject failure. The subsequent conquest of Jamaica was a face-saving afterthought and, it would turn out, the inversion of liberty.In that crucial year, 1655, Cromwell also suppressed an ineffectual royalist rebellion. Spurred by John Lambert, the hero of Dunbar, he surmised that God would be placated by a clampdown on security and sin. England was ided into military districts. Former royalists had to register their movements and pay for the privilege in the form of a decimation tax. Vagrants were apprehended. Meetings at racecourses and bear-baiting rings, where conspiracies might fester, were dispersed. War was waged on fornication, drunkenness and gambling: “wars unwinnable”, Lay notes. In Altham, Lancashire, 200 unlicensed alehouses were closed within three months of the arrival of Major-General Worsley, a fundamentalist who drove himself to death in his maniacal pursuit of vice. The major generals lacked the resources to effect a moral reformation and were soon rejected by the electorate. It was, nevertheless, a dystopian time and not forgotten: “No man in uniform has ruled Britain since Cromwell,” Lay points out.Providence Lost is a learned, lucid, wry and compelling narrative of the 1650s as well as a sensitive portrayal of a man unravelled by providence. Lay’s Cromwell is dithering and ambiguous, too slippery to pin down, but almost likable, almost true. He welcomed Jews back to England, even if he aimed to convert them to Christianity (Sigmund Freud named his son Oliver). He regretted, on a personal and procedural level, the Commons’ retrospective judgment of James Nayler, a priapic, lank haired Quaker with messianic pretensions, who was branded for blasphemy and whipped until his back was a sheet of raw flesh. (One MP even mooted the obscure Roman punishment of stitching him into a sack with a dog, a cock, a viper and an ape, and tossing him into the river.)As Cromwell settled into his reign – an accurate enough word – he displayed shades of hypocrisy. “Lascivious” songs and stage plays were forbidden, but the elite could enjoy dancing and the first English opera. Cromwell dipped into Charles I’s art collection and had a room at Hampton Court draped in sinful tapestries. And yet: when, in the wake of a royalist-leveller gunpowder plot in 1657, the issue of the succession led to parliament offering Cromwell the crown, he turned it down: “I would not seek to set up that which providence hath destroyed.” On Cromwell’s death in 1658, the Protectorate passed to his son Richard, who had that rare gift in politics of realising when he was not up to the job. He did not resist when army radicals ousted him in May 1659. The following year, having lost any semblance of order or legitimacy, they too were gone. The Protectorate was too out of touch, too reliant on the sword and far too expensive to be missed. Its failure ensured that whichever randy prince might come along, monarchy would endure.Two contemporary works capture the contrasting tempers of the time. The Anglican Izaak Walton’s The Compleat Angler is a fishing manual that rejoices in the beauty and bounty of the land. It reflects still waters and a contented patience beyond the ken of Puritanism. Lay doesn’t discuss John Milton’s Paradise Lost, but the title and its themes of tyranny and failed revolution shadow every page of his book. Milton gave his life to the Puritan cause and was crushed by its betrayal, but even when he went blind, he did not lose sight of liberty, or God. Paradise Lost closes with Adam and Eve wiping their tears and venturing out of Eden with “providence their guide”. It is an epic, eloquent scream into the cataclysm and a testament to the intellectual ferment of the republic, but it is the quiet little fishing book that has been reprinted more often.• Providence Lost: The Rise and Fall of Oliver Cromwell’s Protectorate is published by Head of Zeus (RRP £30).

I was gathering schoolbooks when something caught my eye: lettuce leaves, lying on the carpet. Perfect! I thought, scooping them up and packing them. Now I won’t be hungry at university next year! I woke still glowing with pride.Since that dream, I’ve been thinking about how neatly education arranges life into endings and beginnings. You finish one segment, take a summer holiday, and step into the next – nervous, excited – and equipped, if you have my sort of foresight, with a handful of rotting lettuce leaves. But grownup life is more chaotic. There are plenty of potential beginnings – jobs, partners, dietary changes, but nobody has drawn up a schedule. Changes tend to be flung at you, or depend on your own efforts.In my novel Gravity Is the Thing, changes are both flung at and chosen by Abigail, owner-manager of the Happiness Cafe. Back when she was a teenager, Abigail’s brother vanished. Around the same time, she started receiving chapters in the mail from a self-help book called The Guidebook. Now, 20 years later, she’s invited to a retreat to learn “the truth” about The Guidebook.The absence of Abigail’s brother is central to her story. A missing loved one is a particularly traumatic loss because it isn’t entirely a loss. At any moment, the person could reappear. There’s no ending, so there can’t be a new beginning: life without the loved one cannot start. In Gravity, I wanted to explore the promises of the self-help industry in this context of ambiguous loss: much like hope, self-help can be both transformative and destructive.At first, the idea of choosing 10 books about new beginnings alarmed me. I couldn’t think of any. Then I realised that all novels have at least one crisis, discovery or transformation, and each of these triggers new beginnings. Essentially, then, this is a list of books that have been special to me (not the most special, those would be the books of my sisters, Liane and Nicola) or that have shaped me as a writer or person, angled to catch the light.1. Cocaine Blues by Kerry GreenwoodPhryne Fisher, sexy, sassy and newly arrived in Melbourne, Australia, decides to become a private detective. This is the first in a series that is pure, witty, intelligent escapism, each book improving on the one before. I read these in the bath, with chocolate, whenever I’m worried or sad, and everything is instantly better.2. Case Histories by Kate AtkinsonIn his own way, Jackson Brodie is just as charismatic, sexy and capable as Phryne Fisher. Case Histories, the first of Brodie’s stories, has him embarking on his new career as private detective. I read this many years ago, on a train between Toronto and Montreal, just after a miscarriage, and cried at almost every page. It was exactly what I needed. I already admired Kate Atkinson, but this was when I fell in love with her exuberant, powerful prose.3. In the Mood by Laura BloomSet in Sydney in 1946, In the Mood depicts a young couple attempting to restart their marriage after the husband’s return from war. Bloom’s writing is exquisite, and her meticulous dissection of a relationship frayed by secrets and trauma is reminiscent of Henry James (without the excessive sub-clauses). I’ve always been drawn to novels like this that take the domestic sphere as seriously as it deserves.4. Lenny’s Book of Everything by Karen FoxleeEveryone should read this children’s book set in the 1970s. Lenny’s brother, Davy, was born “six days after Neil Armstrong took his famous step and everyone was still crazy with moon fever”. But Lenny’s mother has a “dark heart feeling” about Davy, a feeling “as big as the sky kept inside a thimble”. Davy begins to grow, and does not stop, and so begin years of doctor and hospital visits, worry and hope. The kindness of neighbours, the distraction of Burrell’s Build-It-at-Home Encyclopaedia, Davy’s winning charm and Lenny’s determination, complete an immersive tale about loss and its transformative powers. It will make you sob.5. Self-Help by Lorrie MooreMost of the stories in this collection explore new beginnings of different kinds: how to become “the other woman”, how to be the child of newly orced parents. In the succinctly titled How, we learn how to start a doomed love affair: “Begin by meeting him in a class, in a bar, at a rummage sale.” Moore’s prose is poetic, sharp and devastatingly funny. Just when you think there’s nothing new to say about relationships, Moore cracks open a fresh layer and confounds you with her insight.6. Chrestomanci by Diana Wynne JonesI usually write for young people so I often read children’s books. My favourites are funny, emotionally authentic and contain practical magic. Wynne Jones’s books, like those of Ellen Raskin and Sally Gardner, make my soul breathe a sigh of relief. The Chrestomanci books are set in parallel worlds to ours, and feature protagonists discovering their magical abilities and setting out to develop them. The charming Christopher Chant appears just in time, offering elegant solutions to seemingly intractable problems.7. Dear Mrs Bird by AJ PearceA comic delight of a tale about friendship and love set against the grim landscape of London during the blitz, this novel sensitively conveys how life, even in tragedy and heartbreak, can be humorous and hopeful. Emmeline Lake accidentally takes a new job typing up letters for an advice columnist at a women’s magazine in London, 1941, which rules an extensive range of subjects out of bounds. Defying her instructions, Emmeline begins to answer them herself.8. Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine by Gail HoneymanI read this novel on an aeroplane and it made me laugh often and cry more. Eleanor, nearly 30, has been leading a precise, guarded and solitary life, holding herself together through addiction and routine. Then a singer walks on to a stage, and Eleanor falls instantly in love: “He blazed … I sat forward on my seat, edged closer. At last. I’d found him.” A marvel of humour and heartbreak, Eleanor Oliphant reveals how a new friendship can begin to unravel the traumas that are knotted deep within us.9. Dark Emu by Bruce Pascoe A book about new beginnings that stopped my breath and knocked me sideways. This is an eviscerating study of the beginnings of Australian colonialism. It collects compelling evidence that Indigenous Australians were not, as the prevailing historical narrative maintains – and as required by the law of terra nullius – wandering hunter gatherers, but had established both agriculture and dwellings.10. The Waves by Virginia WoolfThis novel opens with a group of children starting out on their life journeys, and has them guide us through to their old age and death in six exquisite, first-person accounts. I read it in high school and it was my first encounter with language so intensely beautiful. It is lyrical, inventive, self-referential and determined to excavate relentlessly in pursuit of truth.• Gravity Is the Thing by Jaclyn Moriarty is published by Allen \u0026amp Unwin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96a8f7d4badb0f8151875f589443c4227ef475b5/256_0_3473_2084/master/3473.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1f99f5a1a2bb31b1927fd74ebdb01e1","title":"us election brexit and china to sway the markets in 2020","story":"Investors expect a strong year but the presidential race and trade wars could spring nasty surprisesAfter profiting from strong markets in 2019, investors are expecting 2020 to bring further rising asset prices and lively merger activity. But Brexit, the US presidential election and the US trade war with China could all spring nasty surprises over the next 12 months and give the long-running bull market a jolt.Relief that Brexit is resolved will be replaced by anxiety over the future relationship between Britain and the EU, with the transition period due to end in December 2020.“It’s possible that there will be some bounce in activity given the clarity on Brexit, but any improvement in sentiment is likely to fade as the next Brexit deadline draws closer,” Turner says.Ruth Lea, an economic adviser to the Arbuthnot Banking Group, believes the UK will get a “fiscal boost” from the forthcoming budget, due in February. This could include an increase in the threshold for paying national insurance – in effect a tax cut.“The economy has been facing the twin headwinds of Brexit uncertainty, which has almost certainly depressed business investment and could also have undermined the consumer, and the weaker global economy, especially in the eurozone. Having said that, there still seems to be growth,” Lea says.The London stock market shrugged off Brexit anxiety during 2019 to post its best year since 2016. Several analysts predict it will rally in 2020 as relatively unloved UK shares are embraced by investors again.Jeremy Podger, who manages Fidelity’s £2.7bn global special situations fund, says the City should benefit from the increased certainty created by the Conservative win in last month’s election.“It appears to be the case that, in general, investors have been taking money out of the UK stock market since the referendum and that it is generally underrepresented in many international portfolios. This result could be a trigger for these investors to ‘neutralise’ their exposure while existing investors are unlikely to sell for now,” Podger explains.But the prospect of fresh tough negotiations between London and Brussels over their future relationship will probably weigh heavily on sterling in 2020.The UK could crash on to World Trade Organization trade rules in a year’s time if it cannot reach an agreement and refuses to extend the transition period. This would be “a significant step down from the current arrangement and an arrangement that investors fear will negatively impact the UK economy,” says Fiona Cincotta of City Index.This year there could also be a rise in takeover activity. Jonathan Boyers, the head of mergers and acquisitions at KPMG, predicts a flurry of deals in the next six months now the UK has a stable government.“Many of those who have been mulling over an exit have done their early prep work and are set to launch processes in the new year. Meanwhile, I expect there will be a significant amount of demand, keeping prices high, as the market makes up for some of the lost volume,” Boyers says.Ben Higson, the head of the London corporate practice at law firm Hogan Lovells, also expects a “dynamic” mergers and acquisitions market in 2020.“The removal of political uncertainty in the UK has resulted in early signs of confidence returning to deal-making activity, keeping boardrooms and other decision-makers busy in the final weeks of the year and, we expect, early in the new year,” says Higson.Donald Trump’s attempt to win a second term is likely to dominate the headlines for much of the next 12 months.Markets often do well in an election year – partly because the White House incumbent has every incentive to make people feel richer. Trump is rumoured to be considering a fiscal boost known as “tax cuts 2.0” which could lift his popularity, and stocks, before the November election.Many investors have “priced in” a Trump re-election, says Edward Moya of the foreign exchange firm OANDA. A Republican win has been Wall Street’s “base case for a while”, so a Democratic win could startle the markets.“Despite the strong economy, key battleground states such as Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania all have Biden leading Trump in recent polls. A Biden presidency would still be positive for US stocks but perhaps a few percentage points lower than a Trump victory,” Moya points out.But if Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders were to beat Trump, tech stocks, banks and pharmaceuticals firms could all face tougher regulation, triggering a sell-off.John Moore, a senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, says political concerns are already being priced into some stocks.“Elizabeth Warren, for example, has made no secret of her feelings about Facebook and a desire to break up some of the other tech giants. Other candidates have targeted healthcare,” he points out.Trade tensions could escalate in 2020, particularly if the US intensifies pressure on Europe. Last month the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, criticised the “very unbalanced relationship” in trade across the Atlantic, signalling it was a White House priority for 2020.Lighthizer’s comment “imparts a high risk of an escalation of tensions”, says Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services. He fears that a US-EU trade war would “inevitably” tip the German economy into recession.The US economy is enjoying its longest expansion ever, having been growing for more than 10 years. Fears of a recession in 2019 proved unfounded, but the trade tensions stirred up by Trump are bad for growth.“Trade tensions will continue to foster unpredictability in economic policymaking and cause a drag on demand and capital investment,” predicts Los Angeles-based Hercules Investments.China and the US are due to sign their phase one trade deal this month. But there is a risk of this dispute flaring up again, leading to tariffs being reimposed on imports. That would have a chilling impact on the global economy.Central banks will, once again, have a major impact on the financial markets – beyond their traditional remit of price stability. The US Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates on hold but could cut borrowing costs if economic data turns sour.In Europe, Christine Lagarde is overseeing a review of the European Central Bank’s operations, with a new focus on the climate emergency. But she’s not expected to change the ECB’s dovish approach, so interest rates could remain at record lows for some time.In the UK, interest rates could be cut if the UK economy fares badly once Brexit takes place on 31 January.In the cryptocurrency world, the major event will probably be a technical change that halves the reward for digitally mining bitcoins. This halving will probably take  place in May, and is likely to reduce the supply of new bitcoins.The two previous times when the block reward was halved, bitcoin rallied strongly afterwards.“Bitcoin halvings are important events for traders because they reduce the number of new bitcoins being generated by the network. This limits the supply of new coins, so prices could rise if demand remains strong,” IG told clients."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/895c7e208e9391acc9dae6416395eba75f7d044f/0_163_944_566/master/944.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=362c576208b04d901e7d7411ec770f1c","title":"we want a new mayor inside the berlin city game for children","story":"Built as a microcosm of Berlin, the game gives kids a chance to try out different roles in city life – and provides a testbed for ideas on real urban challengesThe landowner and the mayor had been meeting – secretly, it seems – and new plans had been hatched to develop an empty plot of land into an apartment tower. Their goal was to offset a housing shortage, but the plan was unwelcome news to many community members: they’d been rallying to turn the long-vacant space into a community garden.At a town hall meeting, they were livid. “You only want to make money,” one person called out to the landowner. Another grabbed the microphone and yelled, “We want a new mayor!” The room broke into cheers.This scene of municipal discontent, not unfamiliar in public hearings the world over, played out among a group of 13- and 14-year-old Berlin students. Their “town hall” was the back corner of an art gallery, and the plywood “city” they were furiously debating was the setting for an urban role-playing game.Built as a microcosm of Berlin (and, really, most cities), it features a town hall, a cafe, a bank, housing, and a late-night corner shop. The participating students are each given roles – deal-making mayor, out-of-work bus driver, police officer, activist, landowner – and a set of issues to address, including rising rents, thefts, drug dealing, well-paid jobs and unemployment.The model city, and the game, recreates a project that ran in Berlin from 1969-72 in which kids created a small model city and operated mock shops, school spaces and civic institutions. This new iteration, organised by the arts organisation nGbK, aims to give kids a chance to play the roles of the varied actors of city life, but also to build a testbed for ideas to address real urban challenges.“The thing we wanted to do was to focus on the capitalisation of cities, with the question what happens when the houses are for money-making instead of for living in,” says Claudia Hummel, one of the project’s coordinators.Played in rounds, the game quickly becomes tense. Students playing the “landlord” role collect rent from the other participants – and just as in real life, as rents rise, some of the “tenants” struggle to afford their apartments. One game with a class of 7- and 8-year-olds led to anxiety, says Heather Purcell, one of the game guides. “That’s very stressful for them. The rent feels like a real problem. So you can see them experience it and they come to you like, ‘What do I do with this problem?’” she says.For kids with little, if any, experience of real money, financial strain led to some interesting responses. When one student playing a nurse faced eviction, better-paid workers decided to pool their money to pay for everyone’s rent together. “Often, if they’re working with their friends, they think of a collective solution,” Purcell says. “I think kids come to that quicker than grown-ups.”Could the responses offer lessons for adults in real cities? The group upset about losing their community garden site decided their solution should be political. They called new elections and held a hustings. One candidate declared herself a member of the Green party and pledged to plant more trees. A group of boys proposed creating equal rights for everyone in the city – “women also,” one clarified – and offered supporters €10 per vote. A third candidate, wearing a Napoleonic bicorne hat, said he wanted to rid the city of drug dealers and thieves. Every candidate vowed to lower rents. “Almost every kid in Berlin knows this experience of rising rents from their families. They understand the problem,” says Ann-Christin Janzen, the students’ teacher.The tough-on-crime candidate prevailed. As for the landowner, she told the new mayor she would make her proposed apartments available to anyone working for a charity. But by then the citizens had scattered, and other concerns had arisen. The operators of the cafe were opening a second location the newspaper editor was writing up the election results the police officer was back on the beat.

But these fires are not going outWe know the sight by heart: corrugated iron on a low pile of ash with a chimney left standing. Another house gone. And the pattern of bushfires is part of our lives too. They burn until a cold wind blows up the coast when it buckets down dousing the flames.But that’s not the pattern now. The downpour has been postponed officially until late January. Things are looking up: it was April. Either way the experts are saying the weeks ahead are looking dry, tinder dry.As that news sank in this summer an unfamiliar emotion took hold in Australia: not fear so much as dread. These fires are not going out.We know the language of fires. All our lives we’ve waited to hear a blaze is “under control”. Sweet words. But these days they come with a caveat: only for a few days until the wind shifts and the fire jumps the lines.And the rain never comes.We’re used to seeing the bush growing back quickly, green shoots appearing within days on burnt trunks. Eucalypt forests have amazing regenerative powers. But these fires are tearing through ancient forests that have never burnt before. They are done for. And the burnt gums are waiting for rain.We’re taught not to look at the sun. Every child on earth is given the same warning. But in Australia these days you can stare all you like. Take a good long look at that pink disc sinking in the murk. It can’t do you much harm. It’s been tamed by smoke.The smoke is new too: cities suffocating. We’re used to a day or two in town when there’s a bit of smoke about and the light turns a horrible yellow. That’s every summer. But this is different. Deep in cities, miles from the fire front, the smoke is so thick you can’t see to the end of the street.Yet we’ve never seen so much before. Everyone is a photographer now. And until the transmission towers burn and batteries flatten extraordinary images are making their way to the media. We’re seeing these horrors in all their detail.On the beach at Mallacoota, families sat in the smoke under a sky of flame. It’s all on camera. The scene was repeated up and down the coast. At Malua Bay in New South Wales, children, their parents and grandparents were trapped for a day and night between fires and the sea. They’re safe now but it was a close call.Already, these scenes are part of the national imagination. Among Australians of a certain age, they stir memories of a Hollywood potboiler about the end of the world filmed 60 years ago in Melbourne. On the Beach starred Ava Gardener, Gregory Peck and Fred Astaire. The remake stars us.One of the duties of a leader is to find the words in times like these. So many have died. So much has been destroyed. But how can Scott Morrison speak to the experience of the country if he can’t admit we are living through unique times? He says instead: “We have faced these disasters before.”Watch and act, Prime Minister. Watch and act.If Morrison could face the truth, he might speak not only to his country but the world. If Australia were taking effective action against climate change, this catastrophe would give us the right to demand better of the great rogue states on climate, China and the USA.We’re doing our bit, he says as the country burns and the world looks on with a mix of pity and scorn.For empathy, we turn to the plain speech of fire chiefs as they count the toll, giving long lists day after day of destruction, bravery, death and lucky escape in the face of fires these men and women have never seen before.And on television every night, with looks of professional apology, weathermen and women standing in front of scarlet maps of Australia tell us over and over again the news that makes sense of all these woes: according to the best forecasts, we have at least weeks to wait for rain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a611927f4503a36281f16100af8b007d643ead81/0_29_4806_2883/master/4806.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=488b955b85540aaab2c901b62dd7ee77","title":"no such thing authentic cuisine vietnamese food politics","story":"Working at a Vietnamese restaurant, I’ve noticed that our fiercest critics are other Vietnamese Americans. But food can, and should, changeWith food politics, it is tempting to want to categorize dishes as your own, especially as a second- or third-generation Asian American. Growing up in southern California, 20 minutes from Orange county’s famous Little Saigon district, I was raised on phở restaurants with linoleum floors, Formica tables and servers who openly chided my weak accent. You can’t get more Vietnamese than that, and I took pride in it.Later, as a college student in New York, I started work at a phở restaurant in Greenwich Village. I applied to the job, where I still work today, in part because I wanted to be a starving artist without actually starving, but also because I thought it would connect me to a Vietnamese community that was otherwise difficult to find in New York, where there is only a small Vietnamese population.On my first day of work, I clocked in to discover that almost all the workers were Chinese or Latinx. There was not much of an ethnic connection, but I stayed anyway and was trained by the two owners, a pair of half-Vietnamese, half-Chinese men who had gentrified the menu for the Greenwich locals and college students. Fish sauce was generously renamed “Vietnamese chili,” and pig’s feet became “spicy pork knuckles”.The owners were meticulous about decor, and invested in photogenic placemats, a stoop covered in florals and palm leaves, and a bar framed with painted army helmets and a neon “noodle” sign. “Introduce yourself to customers and check up on your tables,” they told me. “This isn’t Chinatown.”I’ve served thousands of people since my first day, and have read every Yelp and Google review. Because of our English menu and appeal to customers who eat with their eyes, our lowest ratings often describe us as “trendy,” “white-washed” and “inauthentic”. Vietnamese customers, especially out-of-towners from areas with large populations of Vietnamese, such as San Jose or Houston, delight in asking if our owners are Chinese (we are trained to say no), ordering in Vietnamese to Cantonese servers, and remarking loudly, “Only two basil leaves?” “The beef is already cooked?” “We should open our own Vietnamese restaurant.”Our head cook is half-Vietnamese, and we often tell customers about how he grew up in Saigon as the first line of defense when people say we aren’t Vietnamese enough. As the only full Vietnamese, I’ll be sent to Vietnamese customers to drop a few xin chàos and cám ơn anhs, even though we shouldn’t have anything to prove. French, Italian and other European restaurants are rarely held to the same standards of authenticity, so why do minority cultures, and particularly Asians, cling to traditional food so tightly?The 20th century saw a wave of Asian immigrants who opened restaurants as a means of survival, a ready money source even if you couldn’t speak English. In recent years, Asian Americans have been entering the restaurant business or innovating their parents’ stores because of culinary ambitions, or to uphold a family history, rather than because it is their only option. Like their parents or grandparents, they are businesspeople although passionate about their culture’s heritage, they are less interested in one singular way to cook. Yet their biggest critics are often other Asian Americans, who want food they can have authority over, claim as their own and use to bolster their identity credibility – even though authenticity is difficult to pin down and impossible to quantify.It’s fine and admirable to open a restaurant with altruistic goals for its impact on community and culture. But many restaurants are still mainly a means to feed one’s family and the employees on payroll. Yes, our restaurant caters to American tastes and is designed around American ideas of Vietnam, but we’re also the most frequented phở joint in the area, and we’re helping introduce more people to Vietnamese food as well as pay our bills.When 10lb-bowls of phở and phở burritos went viral, I was a bit pained to see a Vietnamese staple turned into what I deemed a business gimmick, and mixed with a different cuisine at that. But recipes aren’t stagnant, and neither is culture. Vestiges of French colonization are abundant in Vietnamese food, from Café du Monde coffee to bành mì baguettes, but these are now considered inherently Vietnamese, even as we distance ourselves from an imperialist past.I’m no less Vietnamese because I’ll enjoy an “inauthentic” vegan phở, or a bành mì made by a Senegalese cook. There is no such thing as authentic food. Eat what you want, and enjoy it. There are more important hills to die on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0422835507479cb0ac4b284575d3a16e8b944dcd/0_12_5235_3142/master/5235.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7378953a2d407e95a6bb0b72c98b9bbd","title":"scoff elf help works simple life advice narcissism","story":"I thought simple life advice was a step towards narcissism – until I started listening to an upbeat California podcastIt started small, like all the most insidious addictions. A moment of indecision over what podcast to listen to next – more Brexit analysis or another gruesome cold case centred on a woman’s corpse? – and I was sucked in. Now, I mainline two or three a day. But at least if the problem becomes unmanageable, someone will have a solution to offer me.For my entire adult life, I have not merely scoffed at but actively militated against the self-help industry. On a macro-level, I resented the simplicity of the solutions on offer, seeing them as capitalist sops designed to winkle out their victims’ weaknesses and create a cycle of cash-rich dependency. On a personal level, they offended my carefully nurtured, aggressively deployed intellectual defences where I would bring Proust, they brought a Hallmark card. How stupid did people have to be to sign up to their vacuous bullshit?But life moves on. It was a chance exchange on Twitter that began it: a writer I like and respect recommending a podcast that dealt with weight loss to one of her followers. I tracked it down it was good, sensible, interested in the emotional causes of overeating and calamitous yo-yo dieting, entirely nonjudgmental.But it was also a million miles from any aural aesthetic I would normally gravitate to – upbeat, California, determined. And its host, the fantastically named Brooke Castillo, with her theories of how to bypass the busy, naysaying part of your brain and engage the bit that knows what’s best for you, has a strategy for everything: shedding the pounds, cutting back on the booze, making gazillions, organising your sock drawer, building a windfarm in your back garden (OK, not that one, but I bet she’s working on it). In they drop, these little bursts of can-do, must-do, will-do enthusiasm, once a week, all tied up by Brooke – who’s known hard times, let me tell you – enjoining you to have a wonderful week while she’s walking her dogs. I listened to her entire back catalogue, and then began to venture more broadly into the world of the motivational, seeking out experts in all manner of things that might ail you.I would not say I was a woman with problems not unless you count poor impulse control, specifically in relation to red wine and rich cheese, a reluctance to exercise, a tendency to procrastinate when faced with anything involving a degree of uncertainty (tax returns, thank you letters, travel arrangements and, most worryingly for my chosen profession, writing), separation anxiety, attachment anxiety, unpredictable attacks of nameless dread. The usual. Amazingly, my lifelong devotion to literature, despite its ability to look deep into the human heart, has not yielded much in the way of targeted five-point plans. Nor, apparently, do these issues melt away as the years accrue rather, bad and self-destructive habits appear to become more entrenched and guilt-ridden.But here’s what made the difference: a simple decision not to fixate on whether these nuggets of basic, and occasionally schmaltzy, wisdom were rooted in the kind of philosophical and moral correctness for which I revere George Eliot, nor the delicate apprehension of human consciousness that I get from Virginia Woolf. But instead to ask: “Might they help me to tackle my inbox or say no to an unwise extra glass?”It turned out they did. I have no idea why, but somehow the messages I listened to while driving or making dinner or going to sleep seemed to take root and reappear at useful moments. And my other fear – that this level of what has come to be called self-care is just a cover for next-level narcissism – has also been unfounded. It turns out that when you’re not waking up every day cringing at your own shortcomings, you have more time to spend turning your face out to the world.The hunch that allows me to maintain a degree of brainy amour-propre is that the content of such self-help panaceas is only part of the deal. Perhaps the greater portion is the willingness to admit that one’s imperfections can have their edges smoothed off without a full-scale psychodynamic investigation and consequent dark night of the soul. Perhaps someone else can chip in with a word of advice, a tactic, a regime. Perhaps those thorny areas can, like all those unused apps on your phone, be offloaded until they’re once again needed and perhaps that will be never.So here I am, utterly incapable of solving the world’s problems, having sat beside enough hospital beds to know I can’t turn back the tide of illness or mortality, still surrounded by piles of paperwork and still, sadly, in pursuit of the ability to jump up in the morning, walk five miles and eat a probiotic breakfast. But I have, in the mantra of one of my favourite podcasts, decided to rescind permission to be cruel to myself as a result of these failures. There will be a nice voice to tell me how I can go back to try again and reassure me I haven’t got it all wrong. And that, in these brutal times, is not nothing.• Alex Clark is a writer and critic"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cb6f174f2f066d41753b926625d356beb8af32a/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0919e2e297c1141f8b1f3eb3861ab3f9","title":"music for 2020 pop classical preview","story":"The queen of pop gets intimate, Taylor Swift feels the sunshine and Stormzy takes on the world … plus, classical celebrations begin for Beethoven’s 250thby  Alexis Petridis and  Andrew ClementsKrept and Konan’s last UK live show was at the 20,000-capacity O2 Arena, a rapturously received home town extravaganza with guest appearances from Stefflon Don and Stormzy. These dates, however, will find Britain’s most successful rap duo in more intimate surroundings. Their recent album, Revenge Is Sweet, meanwhile, showed an increasing maturity, with ruminations on mental health, suicide and loss amid the bragging.Tour begins 21 January, Stylus, LeedsFinally released after a series of delays – not to mention three albums that were apparently recorded, then scrapped – Schoolboy Q’s CrasH Talk completed his transformation from gangsta rapper to golf-playing proud father. Amid the bass-heavy party anthems, the lyrics were frequently agonised and self-baiting, marking out the rapper – an affiliate of Kendrick Lamar’s Black Hippy collective – as one of hip-hop’s more thoughtful, conflicted figures.Tour begins 25 January, O2 Academy, GlasgowThe Madame X Tour – in which Madonna plays small venues for the first time since 1985 – has had good reviews and bad publicity in equal measure. The audience in Las Vegas booed her when her show started two hours late, and one US fan attempted to sue her for it – but critics rushed to acclaim the performances. We shall see when she comes to London, where the most expensive tickets are an eye-watering £1,200.27 January–16 February, London PalladiumThe Malian singer-songwriter has carved out a unique niche for herself, combining an acting career with an impressively wide-ranging approach to music that’s seen her collaborate with everyone from Herbie Hancock and Bobby Womack to Damon Albarn and Disclosure. It highlights a disinclination to be pinned down that also informs her solo work: her last album, 2018’s Fenfo, ran the gamut from traditional Malian kora to 60s soul influences.Tour begins 30 January, Roundhouse, LondonCarly Rae Jepsen’s career has never again scaled the commercial heights of her 2012 hit Call Me Maybe – the song with the greatest chorus of the 21st century according to Billboard – but she has instead developed into one of pop’s more intriguing characters, wresting control of her own artistic direction, making consistently fascinating albums, including 2019’s Dedicated, and gaining a noticeably older audience than her peers.Tour begins 7 February, Victoria Warehouse, ManchesterNever let it be said that rock music no longer throws up anything unexpected: the Hu garnered 25m YouTube views for their 2018 debut single Yuve Yuve Yu, on which the Ulaanbaatar quartet melded heavy metal with Mongolian throat singing. Their debut album The Gereg became a global hit in 2019, a sign that they’d hit on something truly unique.Tour begins 8 February, Chalk, BrightonThe Slow Rush is the first album by the expansive Australian psychedelicists for five years, and the follow-up to Currents, which established them not merely as an adventurous musical force but an influence on mainstream pop. Rihanna covered one of its tracks, New Person, Same Old Mistakes frontman Kevin Parker went on to collaborate with Lady Gaga, Kanye West and Travis Scott. Judging by the tracks that have trailed it, The Slow Rush elaborates on the synth-heavy direction of its predecessor.14 FebruaryA one-off gig for the largely female septet whose debut album Blume – a rare foray into jazz, or rather, a convincing blend of jazz, Afrobeat, funk, surf guitar and all points in between, for noted indie label Domino – was released to loud applause in August. But the band really come into their own on stage, adding a rawness and dynamism to their improvisations.18 February, Village Underground, LondonThe three singles thus far released from the 1975’s delayed fourth album have encompassed everything from two-step garage and distorted, yowling punk rock to monologues from Greta Thunberg. Who knows what else it might contain? Not every avenue the 1975 try to head down yields perfect results, but there’s something laudable about an arena-packing band so determined to avoid resting on their laurels.21 FebruaryGrimes’ fifth album has had a tortuous gestation: initially scheduled for 2018, it was delayed amid arguments with her record label and considerable personal strife, including the death of her former manager and negative media coverage of her relationship with Elon Musk. It is apparently a dark concept album about “an anthropomorphic goddess”, which aims to make the notion of climate change “fun”. We shall see.21 February2019 was a good year for the former Lizzy Grant. Her sixth album, the Joni Mitchell-influenced, Laurel Canyon-set Norman Fucking Rockwell!, topped a lot of critics’ end of year lists. Some publications went so far as to suggest it is one of the albums of the decade. The tour that bears its name has already visited the US and the Middle East. Her career-ning set apparently ends with the album’s epic, 10-minute long centrepiece Venice Bitch.Tour begins 25 February, O2 Arena, LondonBarrington Hendricks promoted his third album of experimental hip-hop under the Jpegmafia name as “a disappointment”. No one else seemed to agree with that assessment, though. It was more approachable and melodic than his past work, yet its sound remained chaotically eclectic – he’s claimed influences from both Ol’ Dirty Bastard and Throbbing Gristle – and his stream-of-consciousness vocal style was as manic and provocative as ever. How its glitchy collage approach works live remains to be seen.Tour begins 27 February, EartH, London called Michael Kiwanuka’s eponymous third album – a song cycle displaying the influences of gospel, psychedelic soul and Jimi Hendrix, co-produced by Danger Mouse and London hip-hop auteur Inflo – “one of the greatest albums of the decade”, evidence of how finely crafted its songs were, and how perfectly it balanced the retro and contemporary. In addition, he is a gripping live performer, capable of expanding his material without seeming indulgent.Tour begins 1 March, O2 Academy, BirminghamSaxophonist and composer Cassie Kinoshi’s 10-piece band are in the thick of London’s young jazz revival: their lineup shares members with Sons of Kemet, Kokoroko and Maisha. Their Mercury-nominated debut album Driftglass was an uncompromising, politically engaged yet accessible melding of 60s Blue Note and South African jazz with funk, hip hop and neo-soul, marked out by the sharpness of Kinoshi’s writing.Tour begins 15 March, Blue Arrow, GlasgowKelis’s 1999 debut album Kaleidoscope marked not just her own arrival but a leap in the profile of producers Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo, AKA the Neptunes. Her career since has been uneven, pinballing from chart-friendly EDM to collaborations with TV on the Radio’s David Sitek, but on this tour she returns to her debut, now 20 years old and still sounding, as she would put it, young, fresh and new.Tour begins 16 March, Albert Hall, ManchesterDespite being recorded without the pair ever actually meeting up in the studio, Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey’s most recent album, Who, proved an unexpected triumph: a tough, bolshy collection of songs and a distinct improvement on 2006’s Endless Wire. Their recent live shows have been impressive too, spiking the usual classics with deeper es into their back catalogue.Tour begins 16 March, Manchester ArenaBaxter Dury already had a cult following, but his last album, Prince of Tears, was a considerable step forward and one of 2017’s best: musically eclectic, its lyrics alternately thoughtful and scabrously funny, the sound of an artist finally coming into his own. The menacing, darkly comic single Slumlord – a jaded view of the world of social media, packed with “scary people saying silly shit” – suggests its follow-up is of the same standard.Released 20 MarchIt’s five years since Dan Snaith released an album under the Caribou name, the brilliant Our Love. In the interim, he has seemed more preoccupied by his straightforwardly dancefloor-facing alias Daphni. All of which makes Caribou’s forthcoming return with a new album, Suddenly, and a series of live dates, all the more welcome. The single You and I suggests there has been no dip in the quality of his warm, melancholy electronica.Tour begins 30 March, Brighton Dome2019 was a good year for Ohio-born, LA-based rapper Trippie Redd. His mixtape A Love Letter to You 4 entered the US charts at No 1, evidence of his shift from Soundcloud cultdom to mainstream success. Stylistically varied or hopelessly unfocussed, depending on your perspective, its best moments suggested an artist who could turn his hand to anything from guitar-heavy emo rap to straight-up club bangers.Tour begins 4 April, Brixton Academy, LondonStyles has by some distance the most successful solo career of any ex-One Directioner. There have been more takers for his brand of pop-by-way-of-classic-rock than his former bandmates’ dalliances with R\u0026ampB and Sheeran-esque acoustic whimsy. Whether recently released second album Fine Line will repeat the commercial performance of his eponymous debut remains to be seen, but the level of devotion Styles inspires suggests it will.Tour begins 15 April, Birmingham ArenaSaucerful of Secrets, in which the Pink Floyd drummer and a range of musical associates including Spandau Ballet’s Gary Kemp charge through key tracks from Pink Floyd’s pre-Dark Side of the Moon repertoire, could well have flopped. Instead, it’s been a huge success, garnering praise from his former bandmates and fans alike. These gigs come under the banner of More Games for May, a reference to Pink Floyd’s 1967 gig at the Royal Festival Hall.Tour begins 23 April, G Live, GuilfordJustin Vernon’s musical progress from his folky debut For Emma, Forever Ago has been one of the more interesting in alt-rock, taking in detours to electronica, R\u0026ampB and hip-hop: his most recent album i,i featured cameo roles for everyone from rap producer Wheezy to Bruce Hornsby, which gives you an idea of its breadth. It’s also pleasing that experimental music can end up in venues this big.Tour begins 26 April, Wembley Arena, LondonNick Cave’s most recent live activities have involved solo performances and an unmoderated audience Q\u0026ampA – a kind of IRL version of his Red Hand Files website, where fans are invited to ask him anything. This tour, however, brings back backing band the Bad Seeds, in the wake of their wildly acclaimed 2019 album Ghosteen. It will be intriguing to see how that album’s beatless songs work in arena-sized venues.Tour begins 2 May, Birmingham ArenaAn offshoot of Radio 3’s beloved Unclassified show, this series of gigs at the Southbank Centre pitches modern classical composers against artists working in the field of electronica. Owen Pallett and Daniel Avery offer new compositions in earlier instalments, but this final show features electronic sound artist Tim Hecker alongside composer Daniel Elms. 7 June, Royal Festival Hall, LondonThe Radiohead frontman’s solo tour is named after his 2014 album Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes rather than its 2019 successor Anima. He is accompanied by producer Nigel Godrich and visual artist Tarik Barri providing live projections. Thus far, the setlist has occasionally taken in Radiohead tracks, but largely concentrated on Yorke’s solo oeuvre and the work of his supergroup Atoms for Peace. By all accounts, the live performances add a drive and focus to his experimental electronica.Tour begins 19 June, SEC Centre, GlasgowThe news that Diana Ross will fill the Sunday afternoon “legend” slot at this year’s Glastonbury festival was greeted with widespread delight: it’s a combination that looks about as close to a nailed-on success as it’s possible to get. But Glastonbury is merely one stop on a UK tour, and if the setlist is anything like that of her acclaimed Vegas residency – heavy on Supremes hits and her Chic-produced disco era – it’s going to be a treat.Tour begins 30 June, Leeds ArenaThis year’s British Summertime gigs in Hyde Park include a pop extravaganza headlined by Little Mix, and Pearl Jam performing with the Pixies as support, but the pick of them may be the arrival in the UK of Taylor Swift’s self-styled Lover Fest, wherein she eschews her usual stadiums in favour of taking her most recent album around the world’s festivals. “The Lover album is open fields, sunsets, + SUMMER,” she explained on Instagram. “I want to perform it in a way that feels authentic.”11 July, Hyde Park, LondonThe breakout teen sensation of 2019, whose debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? spawned five US platinum singles, returns to the UK for a series of arena gigs. The sense that her home-produced brand of dark electronics, adolescent psychodrama and gothic sci-fi imagery is a cut above has been bolstered by critical acclaim and comparisons not to her pop peers, but Nirvana – the latter courtesy of Dave Grohl.Tour begins 21 July, Manchester ArenaYou can get a sense of how far Stormzy has outstripped his UK hip-hop peers by the sheer geographical variety of dates on the tour supporting his second album, Heavy Is the Head. His sound is still rooted in British grime, as evidenced by recent single Wiley Flow, but his gigs take in not just Europe but the Middle East, China and Australasia. The biggest shows, however, will be in Britain: a stadium-sized victory lap.Tour begins 2 September, O2 Arena, LondonThe mammoth Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour enters its third year with a string of UK dates. Thus far it has proved notable not merely for its vast commercial success – the first leg alone grossed $125m – but the degree of acclaim it’s received. It is a beautifully staged two-and-a-half-hour extravaganza in which the hits are rolled out with considerable gusto – apparently for the final time.Tour begins 2 November, O2 Arena, LondonBeethoven will dominate the concert schedules in his 250th anniversary year, and his only opera, Fidelio, gets a new production at Covent Garden, with Lise Davidsen and Jonas Kaufmann heading the cast. Before that, however, the BBC Symphony Orchestra begins its year with the European premiere of David Lang’s contemporary take on the Fidelio story Claron McFadden is the unnamed woman struggling to save her partner from wrongful imprisonment. 11 January, Barbican, LondonFor more than a quarter of a century John Adams’s first was indelibly associated with Peter Sellars’ original 1987 production. But recently there have been a whole new generation of Nixon stagings, including John Fulljames’s version, first seen in Copenhagen and now shared with Scottish Opera. Joana Carneiro conducts a cast led by Eric Greene as Richard Nixon and Mark LeBrocq as Mao Tse-Tung.18-22 February, Theatre Royal, Glasgow 27-29 February, Festival Theatre, EdinburghThe Philharmonia reconstructs the historic concert that Beethoven gave in Vienna on 22 December 1808, which included the premieres of his Fifth and Sixth Symphonies and the Fourth Piano Concerto, as well as the Choral Fantasy. Esa-Pekka Salonen conducts the monumental programme, which also includes movements from the Mass in C and the concert aria Ah! Perfido.15 March, Royal Festival Hall, LondonThis Canadian-born, London-based composer is one of the artists-in-residence at the 73rd Aldeburgh festival. As well as Tracery, a new multi-speaker, split-screen installation, there’s the first performance of a work commissioned for soprano Juliet Fraser and the Bozzini Quartet, and the UK premiere of Miller’s A Large House for string orchestra and percussion.13, 16 and 20 June, Snape Maltings, Aldeburgh"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1471e33fbe4ccecfd2b2dd74ee56928881c00cad/0_0_3840_2560/master/3840.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=cdd60c05c1aa42ae39551e04e7e043e9 1320w","title":"do you have a favourite tree share your pictures and stories","story":"As part of a new series, we’d like you to tell us about your favourite tree and why it’s special to youAs deforestation continues to threaten green space around the world, and the ’s Christmas appeal launches to tackle it, we’d like to celebrate our trees.Outside of their ecological value, many of us have sentimental attachment to trees.

But 12 months on, what has changed? Has there been any tangible improvement?While some brands continue to pump out clothes like there is no tomorrow (which if they carry on, there won’t be), many of us are rethinking the quantities of clothes we buy. Greta Thunberg was i-D’s most memorable cover star, “the girl who changed the world”, who turned up for the interview dressed in a purple puffer jacket, bright-pink snow trousers and rubber boots. “Her wardrobe is limited, she doesn’t want new things,” the magazine reported.In July, the Swedish Fashion Council cancelled Stockholm fashion week to explore more sustainable options, and Extinction Rebellion called for London Fashion Week to do the same. London fashion week went ahead as planned but the final day was marked by a symbolic funeral where XR Fashion members grieved for the industry.Never has the fashion and textile industry been such a focus of attention, primarily because of its disproportionate contribution to greenhouse gas emissions – 1.2bn tonnes of CO2 per year according to Greenpeace, more than that produced by international shipping. In August, 32 companies representing around 150 brands signed the Fashion Pact at the G7 summit, promising to cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 and to ban virgin plastic from packaging – by 2030. Considering that, according to the UN, we only have 10 years left to limit global warming to 1.5C, these are hollow targets.It’s not only the environment that the industry continues to disregard. The fire in December at the New Delhi bag factory, where around 100 people were sleeping overnight, resulted in more than 40 deaths. “Six years on from the Rana Plaza factory collapse, most brands still have far too little visibility of their supply chains,” said Carry Somers, co-founder of the organisation behind the #whomademyclothes campaign, Fashion Revolution. “Transparency leads to accountability which leads to change.” The Fashion Transparency Index is also pushing the industry towards greater transparency with year on year improvement for many of the brands listed. In a welcome move towards transparency, H\u0026ampM announced back in April that it would share details such as production country, supplier names, and names and address of factories with its customers. It has been a year of big statements by famous names, perhaps the boldest being Gucci’s claim in September that it was now carbon neutral. The greenwash radar went into overdrive. “The best way to get to zero emissions is to close the company, but then 18,000 people will lose their jobs. When we talk about the environment, we need to keep that in mind as well,” said CEO Marco Bizzarri. “Offsetting is better than not doing anything…”While some industry leaders are at least starting to send out positive messages, policy makers are not so enthusiastic. In June, the government rejected recommendations made by the environmental audit select committee to regulate the fast fashion industry, including a charge of 1p for each garment to fund better clothing collection and sorting, and a ban on incinerating unsold clothes or sending them to landfill. “The government is out of step with the public, who are shocked by the fact that we are sending 300,000 tonnes of clothes a year to incineration or landfill,” said the former Labour MP Mary Creagh, who chaired the committee.Despite the government’s inability to legislate, fashion activism was on the rise. In September, 62,000 people took part in Oxfam’s Secondhand September campaign, pledging to buy nothing new in an attempt to stem the flow of the 11m items of clothing sent to landfill every week in the UK. And an alternative to Black Friday is gaining momentum in the form of Buy Nothing Day. “In a world of overconsumption and fast fashion, one of the most radical things we can do is to keep our clothes in use for as long as possible,” declared the designer Christopher Raeburn, who closed the tills at his two stores and spent the day doing on-the-spot clothing repairs instead.The willingness to embrace new ways of shopping that disrupt the high-volume, fast-fashion model, such as resale platforms (Vestiaire Collective and Depop both popped up at Selfridges this year and continue to grow their audiences) and rental (witness the takeover of the (British) Fashion Awards in December by rental platform My Wardrobe HQ) – is tangible.Bethany Williams scooped the prize for best emerging talent for menswear at awards, having already won the Queen Elizabeth II award for design earlier in the year. She was also shortlisted for the LVMH prize and is nominated for the upcoming Arts Foundation award (winner announced in January). Her business model gives back to the social enterprises she works with to weave cloth from waste materials, and to charities who benefit from a percentage of her profits. Now that’s progress.

No spoilers, but Halloween Ends has just been announced for 2021, so we suspect both characters may emerge from this film vaguely in tact.John Krasinski’s character may be dead, but he’s back as director for this follow-up to his smash hit film about a family – headed by his real-life wife, Emily Blunt – who must live in silence lest they alert only-auditory monsters to their presence. That film ended with a possible solution this one introduces substantially more characters and Cillian Murphy and Djimon Hounsou have joined the cast.

It’s written by twins who were responsible for the first two Conjuring movies and is directed by Floria Sigismondi, the Italian music video supremo whose only previous film is 2010’s The Runaways.Jordan Peele refreshes the man in the mirror for a new generation in this “spiritual sequel” to the 1992 horror, which returns to the same, now gentrified Chicago neighbourhood – and to Tony Todd as the vengeful ghost of the son of a slave who was murdered in the late 19th century. Todd gave his blessing to Peele’s involvement at the inception, saying “I’d rather have him do it, someone with intelligence, who’s going to be thoughtful and dig into the whole racial makeup of who Candyman is and why he existed in the first place”. If Beale Street Could Talk’s Teyonah Parris stars opposite Yahya Abdul-Mateen II.Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren are back to face off against bad dollies and duff nuns in the latest round of jump cuts.

The past five weeks have served as a watching brief, with the former Manchester United player contained to the dugout as part of Philip Cocu’s staff. But England’s record goalscorer returned home to play, and the wait is almost over.When the move was first mooted, Derby’s players on the coach home from an opening-day victory at Huddersfield assumed links to Rooney were a wind-up. However, that rather bizarre image of Rooney navigating the muck and nettles of the Championship, to borrow Neil Warnock’s description of the ision, is about to become a magnificent reality.Rooney, almost three years on from surpassing Sir Bobby Charlton as Manchester United’s greatest goalscorer, is expected to make his Derby bow against Barnsley on Thursday after the club submitted the relevant paperwork to the Football Association and EFL at midnight on Tuesday to formally register him when the transfer window reopened. In an instant, Rooney will become the Football League’s biggest superstar.Last season it was Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole, this time around Cocu and Rooney are the coups, high-profile signings and headline arrivals orchestrated by the Derby’s owner, Mel Morris. The club are 17th, nine points off the play-off places, but they hope Rooney, a Champions League and five-times Premier League winner, can ignite an indifferent season.Rooney, too, is desperate to make a difference and finish his playing career on a high. Since arriving, Rooney has trained with the rest of the squad as planned but has also been on a tailor-made fitness programme – a mini pre-season regime – to help him get up to speed. Where Rooney plays remains to be seen but the 34-year-old is expected to operate in midfield, possibly as a No 10 in Cocu’s preferred 4-2-3-1 system.Rooney may no longer be in his pomp but Derby are rightfully excited to unleash their not-so-secret weapon. Understandably, there is a hum of excitement surrounding Rooney’s Derby debut and supporters have been singing his name ever since he was introduced on the Pride Park pitch before a draw against Queens Park Rangers in November.It was then he took a pew in the second row of the home dugout for the first time, behind Cocu and his assistants Twan Scheepers and Chris van der Weerden. During the victory over Charlton on Monday – Derby’s first win in eight matches – supporters in the South Stand made it known that Rooney is coming to town.The past month offered a glimpse into the future, with Rooney observing Cocu and his staff at close quarters, studying how they deliver analysis clips from a coaching perspective, and sitting in on team meetings. On the pitch he is expected to become a key link, a bridge between the dressing room and management and, while there is a sense he may assume some coaching responsibilities next summer, for now his primary focus is on playing.Since his arrival Rooney has impressed staff with his attitude, notably his down-to-earth nature and tangible hunger to drive Derby up the table. During his first training sessions, Rooney’s unerring speed of thought was particularly striking. Off the pitch he has been priceless for both youngsters and experienced professionals, giving snippets of advice to players at half-time, while he has acted as a sounding board for Mason Bennett and Tom Lawrence, who were charged with drink-driving in October in an incident that led to Derby sacking their former captain, Richard Keogh. Keogh has appealed that dismissal and the club await an EFL hearing.Only the bottom club Wigan have scored fewer league goals than Derby this season and Rooney’s creativity and touch will surely help solve that problem. “You can be standing right behind him but you don’t see the pass he sees,” says the Derby defender Matt Clarke. “He is just a level above.”Then there is Rooney’s experience, nous and game-management, skills that will be invaluable throughout the second half of the season. Rooney has already had an impact on Derby’s younger players, notably the 18-year-old midfielder Jason Knight, who scored both goals on Monday. “He almost reminds me of myself when I was younger in terms of no fear,” Rooney said.It is impossible to predict quite how big a splash Rooney will make but his arrival has already given Derby a timely boost. “It has given everyone a lift,” says Clarke. “When he first came into the building, everyone was a little bit in admiration and almost starstruck to a point, and rightly so because arguably England’s best ever player is around the training ground, having breakfast and having lunch with you.“But he has just become one of the lads now, which is a nice thing. In training he has scored goals from crazy angles and chipped the keeper from a position where no one else would even attempt. There have definitely been ‘wow’ moments. And I think that’s to be expected.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6821484be2a7367f5dc8a95b6062ca366a0a0251/0_99_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f13b5ffda90f17aa7d7d97d2e66f084a","title":"brighton v chelsea premier league live","story":"Safe to say that Alireza Jahanbakhsh has scored the goal of the decade so far, with apologies to Jack Grealish. Final score: Burnley 1-2 Aston Villa. Great news for Dean Smith and a poor result for Sean Dyche. Jahanbakhsh’s goal deserves the plaudits. It was spectacular, and a deserved equaliser for Brighton who took the game to Chelsea, who suffered somewhat after Graham Potter made some attacking changes. Chelsea slackened off rather too much Frank Lampard is likely to be peeved at his team’s performance but relieved at the full-time whistle.Full-time: Cheers as Reece James is booked for fouling Trossard. It sets up the last kick of the game, a free-kick chance from the edge of the area. Lewis Dunk takes it and it’s too tame to beat Kepa. 90+4 min: Might Kovacic have been sent off? Trossard had spun away and that looked a tactical foul, and the Croatian had been booked. Lenient from the referee. 90+3 min: There’s been some four minutes added on and the action has only just got more frenzied. Hudson-Odoi almost made amends for his earlier miss by heading back across goal for Abraham only for Webster to read the intentions and clear. 90 min: Some handbags. The ball, and not the game, had gone flat so a drop-ball is called. Maupay chose to contest it, which is against the rules these days and is thus booked. No, I didn’t know that rule, either. 89 min: Kepa saves Chelsea! The ball came in from the right and Maupay had chance to score from eight yards out. He did everything right but Kepa had also guessed right, making a fine save with his legs and knocking the ball back out from danger. 88 min: What a chance for Chelsea, and what a peeved expression from Frank. Abraham worked the space for Hudson-Odoi, who had the whole goal begging but missed.87 min: It was the classic overhead kick, by the way. Like Rooney v Manchester City, and perhaps with a little less shin involved. 85 min: Jahanbakhsh took 18 months to score his first Brighton goal and then, jusy days later, followed it up with one of the best of the season. That was spectacular. Chelsea are still reeling from it, and Frank Lampard again looks peeved.What an overhead kick from Jahanbakhsh! Dunk won the header and he launches it into the net. 82 min: Trossard, Sussex’s answer to Eden Hazard, tries some kind of Gordon Strachan-esque free-kick routine. He plays a short one, then hits the resultant pass, a moving ball, away from everyone. Wasteful. 81 min: Connolly has been a livewire and it is his defiance that forces another attack from which Maupay is fouled by a Kovacic for another yellow card. 80 min: Close! Brighton have a free-kick, taken by Trossard. Connolly controls the ball in a tight space and then turns to scuff a shot that Kepa has to deal with. That’s as close as Brighton have come. 78 min: Connolly at last gets some space but then he loses his touch at a vital moment and the ball spills off for a throw. Brighton have suffered rather for a lack of composure. Montoya shows the same by smashing the ball willy nilly when a cross needed to caressed rather than walloped. 76 min: Tammy Abraham takes a kick where the sun doesn’t shine - unless you are an advocate of perineum sunning - from Bernardo in a clash by the sideline. Hopefully not too much harm done. 74 min: Callum Hudson-Odoi comes off the left and looks to have an open chance at goal, only for Adam Webster to smell the danger and clear. 73 min: Jahanbakhsh swings and misses the target as the ball spills. He cannot help but lean back and screw the ball wide. 72 min: Chelsea’s free-kick after that Dunk foul drifts out of play. Off goes Mason Mount, and he will be replaced by Kovacic, who will try and protect the defence a little more than Mount might be capable of. 70 min: Nice skill from Bernardo got Jahanbakhsh away but the Iranian was rather less than speedy. The breakdown of that move allows Tammy Abraham to buy Lewis Dunk the second booking of the game. 69 min: First booking sees Zouma pile into Connolly and bounce the Irishman off his feet.68 min: Brighton change: Jahanbakhsh on for Mooy. That suggests Graham Potter sees speed being off the essence. 66 min: First Chelsea sub: off goes Pulisic, who did OK, for Callum Hudson-Odoi, who is still yet to show his best since coming back from that admittedly awful injury. Both players may have the spectre of Wilfried Zaha to contend with if those transfer types are right.64 min: Jorginho makes an error in midfield and Maupay has the chance to play in Connolly, whose legs are pumping, only for Rudiger to come across. At the other end, James’ shot is deflected after Pulisic and Mount set up an attack.  63 min: This game has heated up nicely. Not a huge amount of quality but there is a competitive edge. 61 min: Rudiger enraged as he commits another foul on Connolly. His ire is not with the ref but Tammy Abraham for being too loose with the ball. 60 min: Mooy tries to get the speed of Connolly away but Reece James shows real defensive anticipation in realising the danger and running the ball out of play for a goal kick. 59 min: Brighton forge on but Propper’s attempt at a cross swerves behind. In truth, the final ball has been poor rather too often from them. 58 min: Kante fires in a snap shot that is saved by Ryan. Chances and openings at both ends now. 57 min: Near daylight for Trossard, only for the Belgian to overrun the ball. There’s disappointment among the home fans over that one. That combo of Trossard, Maupay and Connolly carries a threat. 55 min: Pulisic appears to be the out-ball of choice for Chelsea and he shows off his party trick in cutting inside, and blamming an effort at goal. And it’s wide this time. 53 min: A rare Chelsea sojourn, with Azpilicueta on the burst. It comes to nothing. Then Rudiger is accused of a handball from a long pass forward for Dunk for Connolly...but Chelsea get an attack away and Pulisic powers the ball into the arms of Mat Ryan. Signs are that this is opening up.52 min: Chelsea have been unsettled by Brighton’s energy though Albion have not exactly threaded much together themselves. This game has betrayed the bleariness of the time of year there is too much football. 50 min: Connolly now chases down Rudiger. Good work from him. The plan appears to be stopping Chelsea being able to settle and Connolly is one of those players ideal for that approach, a ratter.49 min: Rudiger fouls Connolly by the touchline, with the young Irishman showing admirable strength for someone who is giving away at least half a foot in height. 47 min: The belief appears that Chelsea can be got at so Brighton are going to try and attack. The opening moments, though, have been cagey.46 min: They are back underway and Graham Potter has made an adventurous change: on comes Aaron Connolly for Yves Bissouma. Brighton go for something approaching 4-4-2. Chelsea closed out the half on the attack, just as they began it but they were under pressure from a Brighton side that got better as the game went on and once Graham Potter made a tactical change. Cesar Azpilicueta’s goal separates the two teams.45+2 min: Reece James still getting booed. Kante creates space and his switch of play gives Pulisic the chance to ping a shot on goal, just wide of Mat Ryan’s e and the left-hand post. 45 min: Three added minutes, mostly for that shoulder injury for poor Dan Burn. 44 min: Brighton have gone like for like on Chelsea and look to have the stronger team at this point. Some ragged defending blocks off the excellent Maupay from having a chance.43 min: Brighton go close! Maupay goes down the channel and lays up Trossard, whose shot is whipped across goal and Kepa has to make a full-length save. Montoya’s attempt at the rebound goes wide. 41 min: Aston Villa are 2-0 up on Burnley and Jack Grealish does have his goal this time. Life during VARtime can be terribly confusing. 40 min: Brighton continue to dominate possession without ever looking like creating danger. Pulisic works back well to break up play and the pitchside mic catches a bit of his American twang. 38 min: Chelsea trying to slow things down and take the sting out of a resurgent Brighton, though the home team do look a little short on the final ball. They are rather less than poised. 35 min: Chelsea concede a corner after a Zouma brainfart, and Brighton force another when Kepa looks similarly panicked. Mooy took both of them and dangerously so, and another is forced for him to ping the ball into the area of uncertainty. Mooy gets another attempt when the third corner spills out but Abraham gets back for a fine defensive header better from Brighton, who have at last stepped it up.

Here’s how to get in the habitMuch like going for a run or eating your greens, saving your cash offers long-term benefits, but is not always appealing. And, let’s face it, there are always good reasons not to lock your money away – confusion over different accounts, fear of making the wrong choice, or feeling as though you don’t have enough money to make it worthwhile can all outweigh the best intentions. But, as the NHS’s Couch to 5K programme taught us about exercise, things are a lot less overwhelming if you start small and build up.Don’t worry if you have been putting it off for years – you can’t be too old to start saving. Whatever your age, you need to decide that saving is something you want, or need, to do, says Iona Bain, the founder of the blog Young Money. After all, she points out, “saving is only possible with motivation”.If you are struggling to feel driven, she has advice: “Saving gives you choices in the future. Once you start understanding that it’s still your money, just put somewhere safe in case you need it, you start finding that motivation that will make saving much easier.”Don’t start a savings account if you have expensive debt to pay off – you will be better off clearing an overdraft or credit card, as they charge higher interest rates than you can earn. But once these debts are cleared, you can start to think about building a nest egg.One option is to set up a monthly standing order to pay into a savings account just after you have been paid. The logic here is that if you cannot see the money in your current account you will not spend it. This is a good choice if you know how much you can afford to save each month.If you don’t, you can squirrel away money throughout the month using a round-up feature. Offered by the new online banks, including Revolut, Starling and Monzo, as well as Lloyds TSB and Halifax, these let you round up any spending to the nearest £1 and put the difference into a savings pot. So, if you spend £1.45, you will be debited £2, of which 55p will be squirrelled away.Alternatively, you could wait until the end of the month and sweep what is left in your current account into your savings. You can do this with any bank, but First Direct’s 1st account can be set up to do this automatically.As with Couch to 5K, it can be helpful to have a goal. Small, short-term targets are good at first, because they are achievable and will get you into good habits. It might be tickets for a show or an activity you have wanted to see for a long time, a new pair of jeans or a night away. Whatever it is, work out how much you need and when you need it.Once you have achieved your aim, do not close your account. You are in the habit now, so keep going.Bain says not to worry too much about savings rates at this point, but if you want an extra incentive, a website such as Savings Champion will show you the best-paying accounts. If you want to be able to withdraw your money in the next year, take a look at easy-access accounts.If you are saving for a property, think about using a Lifetime Isa. If you want to save for the long term, start exploring pensions and other investments. Some of these have minimum payment levels as low as £1, although small investments may disappear in fees, so you will need more to make it worthwhile – £25 a month is more typical and meaningful.“If you are investing over a short time period, certainly fewer than five years, then you should stick with cash, even though interest rates are currently at very low levels,” says Patrick Connolly, a chartered financial planner at the advice firm Chase de Vere. “This is because, if you invest in the stock market and it falls in value, you will have very little time to claw back any losses.”A good starting place if you have a small sum and do not want to take much risk is a fund that tracks the UK stock market. The Money Advice Service, an independent body set up by the government, has a useful guide on how to buy investments, with links to sites where you can research potential purchases."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d1d6723df63464b375586b4dcdc5d2bcb44c03a/0_538_2179_1308/master/2179.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d61b687a626ec38f60f104d46cc2639","title":"how can i celebrate my friends new success without envy","story":"There are uncomfortable thoughts at the root of most envy, writes Eleanor Gordon-Smith, and more often than not those thoughts are about yourselfI’m struggling with jealousy over an old friend’s (well-deserved!) success. We both work in a creative industry, and when we were starting out we spent a long time consoling each other over (very cheap) red wine about the long, unpredictable luck-driven road to success in our field. We’re both good at what we do, and after years of slogging away, her latest project has taken off in a big way, with a whole new set of opportunities opening up. I want to feel happy for her in an uncomplicated way, but the moments of envy and “why not me?” keep creeping in, and I’ve found myself turning down invitations to catch up because of it. How can I handle those feelings in a healthy way and get back to celebrating her achievement?The comedian Billy Connolly tells a story about going back to his hometown and stopping at the pub to see his old mates. He dreads it because he knows that until the moment he opens the door everyone in that pub is perfectly happy with their lives. But then he walks in, and the lives that seemed full and warm just moments ago suddenly seem tinny and empty to the people who have to live them. He hates making his friends feel tinny.This is a way of saying that your friend is going to be feeling just as weird about this transition as you are. She knows how much of her own story is luck and she knows that your talent is equal to hers, which means that when she goes to sleep in the hotels that look so glamorous from the outside I promise you, on the struggling-artist sacrament of cheap wine, that she feels like she shouldn’t be there. So the good news is you’re in this together. You both want a friendship that doesn’t embarrass you.I think that’s what envy is, often: just curdled embarrassment. It’s not that we resent someone having what we want so much as we’re humiliated by the reminder that we didn’t get it. So your task might be speak candidly to yourself about why your friend’s success makes you squeamish and embarrassed. It could be that you think if you’d worked harder, you could be there too it might be that deep down you aren’t proud of everything you’ve produced. Whatever uncomfortable thought is at the root of those feelings (and I’d lay good money it’s about yourself) you should pull it out by the roots of its hair and squeeze it until it dies.Then you should go and do the best work you’ve ever done. Take your irritation and make it fuel. Write about it. Tear up what you’ve written and eat it. Do whatever you have to do to get the flywheel in your brain cranking until time goes stripy. Lose yourself in the work, splash in it, hate it, drink it, collapse in a heap at the end of the day knowing you did what Annie Dillard tells writers to do: “spend it all, shoot it, play it, lose it, all, right away, every time”.Who cares if it gets recognised? The creative world apportions its rewards with capriciousness at absolute best and mediocrity at worst. You don’t want that. You want the sweet earned exhaustion of having survived combat with a craft. When you’re proud of yourself for that, really proud in your marrow, the shiny things your friend has won’t look so good by comparison. In a few months’ time when she’s eyeballs deep in a press tour and her brain has rusted from going so long without that kind of work, she might very well start to envy you. And that’ll teach her.Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with? Eleanor Gordon-Smith will help you think through life’s questions and puzzles, big and small.

But how – and where do you find the time? Here are the tips and advice you need for a pleasure-filled yearThe last time I felt joy was at an event that would be many people’s vision of hell: a drunken Taylor Swift club-night singalong in the early hours of the morning a few weekends ago.I certainly experience joy, either as peaks of euphoria or in quiet, unexpected bursts. But as I go about my everyday business – sprinting to meet deadlines, standing in front of the open fridge – I wouldn’t say it looms large.I am not alone. Many of us treat joy like the good china, only warranted on special occasions. Even if we know it is within our reach, we may not see it is within our control.But this is a mistake, according to happiness experts. Nataly Kogan, the author of Happier Now, says: “Happiness and emotional health are not extras, or bonuses, or nice-to-haves – they’re actually at the core of what helps us live well.”Seeking joy may sound frivolous, but being happy has been shown to promote habits and behaviours that are important to our health. A 2017 study of roughly 7,000 adults found that those with positive wellbeing were more likely to be physically active and to eat fresh fruit and vegetables. Being happy has also been linked to better sleep, better weight management, lower stress levels, an improved immune system and even increased life expectancy.Despite the myriad benefits of joy – and the obvious incentive that it feels good – many of us don’t prioritise it. But experts point out that our resources and energy are finite what we put off will fall by the wayside. So, as with any goal, the first step to a joyful life is to make it a priority – which may mean you need to let go of other commitments – and then do the work. In other words, we need to start taking joy seriously.As the founder and chief executive of the wellbeing business Happier, Kogan helps companies to improve their workplace culture and professionals to foster joy in their lives – lessons born out of her experience of career burnout and personal dissatisfaction in her late 30s. She likens herself at the time to a ship on the ocean – fine in favourable conditions, but at the mercy of any storm.Now 44 and based with her family in Boston, Massachusetts, Kogan says she has landed on practices and tools to harness happiness as a steady, sustainable presence in her daily life. The first of these is not to think of happiness as something to pursue at a later date, when your life is in order. “I lived with this idea of: ‘I’ll be happy when ...’ as I know so many people do,” she says. “We have to look at emotional health as a skill, not a destination. And, as with any skill, when you practise, you do better.”So, what can we do to make 2020 a more joyful year?Start by identifying where joy is most lacking. Sarah Waite, a London-based psychologist, suggests the “wheel of life”, a personal development exercise derived from the Buddhist theory of balance. Draw a large circle, ide it into eight or 10 segments and label each to reflect a different area of life that you want to assess.There are templates online, typically along the lines of fun and recreation, physical environment, career, finances, personal growth, romance, family and friends, and health. Shade in each wedge to reflect your level of satisfaction.The finished circle should be an overview of the areas of your life that you feel you have under control, and those that may need further attention. When it comes to deciding where to allocate resources, “it’s not necessarily the one you’ve marked the lowest it’s the one you really value the most,” says Waite. It may be that your job is not a priority for you, so it doesn’t matter if it remains only two-thirds filled.The goal is to get perspective and clarity. The brain has evolved to be much more sensitive to negatives than positives as, historically, it has been more important for us to be attuned to hazardous situations than satisfactory ones. This “negativity bias” distorts our perspective, meaning it is hard to make a good decision under stress, says Kogan. “People can focus on things that are not ‘as they should be’ … We all have our stories of why we are not happy, at work or otherwise.” But small, practical steps taken to boost joy in one part of life can improve happiness across the board as momentum builds.Kogan’s first tip is to start by writing a list of what you like about your job, no matter how small. “Be specific, think broadly and don’t judge your list as you write it.” It doesn’t matter what they are, or how many there are the idea is to shift your mindset.Kogan suggests making it a daily habit to note three small, highly specific things that you are grateful for every morning, perhaps before you reach for your phone. “It’s not about pretending that nothing is wrong, it’s about helping your brain to get out of that negativity spiral.”Just three weeks of this consistent “gratitude practice” has been shown to establish new neuron connections facilitating optimism, with the effects lasting for six months. Mindfulness and self-compassion are similarly powerful, says Shamash Alidina, the author of Mindfulness for Dummies and the co-founder of the not-for-profit Museum of Happiness – and more attainable than people may think.Many equate mindfulness with clearing one’s mind of thoughts entirely. This means they often give up out of frustration, says Alidina – but “it’s not about not thinking, it’s about being aware”. Spending just a few minutes noticing your thoughts pass you by like clouds, experimenting with what Alidina calls your “flexibility of attention”, can equip you to stop negative spirals before they start. “People associate meditation with being calm or relaxed, but it’s really just about not getting lost in your thoughts,” he says.Finding lasting happiness is also about what we do, particularly what we do for others. Kogan says it is important to have a sense of purpose – to find what she calls “the bigger why” among our deadlines and meetings. “It’s not possible to be a happy human being if you don’t feel like what you’re doing is meaningful,” she says.Assessing your to-do list – particularly tasks you find mundane or frustrating – through the lens of “Who does this help?” can increase motivation, lift your mood and improve your ability to manage stress, she says. “When you say: ‘This project is going to help a lot of people’ – my team, customers, readers, whatever – your stress has context and you feel more resilient getting through it.”Helping others may seem like a circular way of boosting your happiness, but Kogan says even small gestures, such as pulling out a chair for a colleague or checking in with them about their day, releases oxytocin in the giver and the receiver. Over time, it also fosters a sense of belonging at work and can lead to office friendships – one of the most common factors in job satisfaction.The mindset shift encouraged by practising “intentional kindness” means it is worth doing for your own happiness, says Kogan. At 3pm every day, she receives a reminder to “be kind”. Sometimes that is as simple as texting someone she hasn’t spoken to in a while and telling them that she’s thinking of them: “I cannot tell you how much that means to people.”It is well known that strong relationships are important to happiness, but what those look like – and how to forge them – can be ambiguous. “Happiness can feel very abstract,” says Gretchen Rubin, the author of The Happiness Project. “My approach is to think about what you want, then break it up into manageable, concrete actions that you can actually take.”In terms of improving relationships, that might look like making a regular time to call or meet a friend, committing to attend a reunion or throw a party, or having a daily exchange with someone in public. Every five days or so, Rubin’s family email each other an update on the “boring everyday stuff” of their lives, freed from any pressure to entertain or an expectation to reply. “We realised that, by staying in touch with the little minutiae, we would feel more connected – and it’s absolutely working.”Making warm greetings and goodbyes habitual at home is another small but effective shift (“I always think that I don’t want to be less enthusiastic than my dog,” says Rubin). Such low-level commitments are less daunting to start and easier to keep up – and they make a real impact. We all have different definitions of happiness, Rubin says, whether it be joy, peace, satisfaction, bliss. “My way of thinking about it is: today, next month, next year – are there things you can do to be happier?” she says. “And if there are, why not do them?”If Rubin comes across an improvement at home that she can make in less than a minute, she does it immediately. For her, “outer order contributes to inner calm”, so happiness can be as simple as a clean kitchen bench or a decluttered shelf. “It feels trivial – and yet over and over people say: ‘When I have control of my environment, I feel like I have control generally,’” says Rubin. “Like making your bed every morning – it gives people a lift, more than really makes sense.”Often this is understood as minimalism – but there are many happy, successful people who take pleasure in being surrounded by their possessions, says Rubin. It is not a moral failing to prefer abundance, and making your personal space reflect your values and interests “can be very pleasing”.Ingrid Fetell Lee, the author of The Aesthetics of Joy, agrees. “We’ve been taught to think about our homes through the lens of other people: what’s trendy, what the design books say,” she says. As a result, many of us are out of touch with how our spaces measure on our own “joy meters”. We may view a neutral grey palette as the height of sophistication when, in fact, what brings us pleasure is a neon front door.Even the presence of different shapes can have an impact, with people finding angular objects more subconsciously anxiety-inducing than round ones. Rounded objects also tend to make environments more playful, says Lee: “Not only because your mind is unconsciously set at ease, but because you’re less worried about bumping into sharp edges.”Play is an effective mood-booster that is often neglected in adulthood. Rubin says she marks holidays such as Halloween and St Patrick’s Day with themed meals, just because, while the Museum of Happiness’s pop-up installations in London and Manchester later this month are testament to the transformative effects of a ballpit on otherwise sober adults.To bring some of that spirit into your home, Lee advises trying to imagine you are visiting for the first time: “Notice how it makes you feel, almost the physiological sensation in your body, as you move from room to room. What are the things that, when your eyes land on them, make you smile or feel drained?”The key is not to feel burdened by your possessions. “Owning less means you are surrounding yourself with only your favourite things,” says Joshua Becker, who writes the blog Becoming Minimalist. Being intentional with the things that we own – and, by extension, our money – means that our lives align with our values and passions: things that really matter to us. “Minimalism removes distractions so that we can free up our money, time and energy on those things that bring us real joy in life,” says Becker.Play, gratitude and kindness may factor into a life full of joy, but so can discipline. A sense of control is more important to happiness than many people realise, says Rubin. Prosaically enough, this is inextricable from exercise, sleep and good money management. Too often, happiness is located solely in the moment, she says, when it could be achieved through giving up sugar or alcohol, or setting an alarm to go to bed on time. “Sometimes, to be happier in the long run, we have to ask more of ourselves or deprive ourselves of something,” says Rubin. “A happy life is not one that’s focused only on the present.”In the same vein, putting off a difficult or boring task can detract from your daily experience more than getting stuck into it. Waite says she rolls her eyes at the framing of self-care as “baths and candles”: “I love those things, but if doing your tax return is really making you anxious, maybe the kindest thing you can do for yourself is to make a start.” It may not be what is typically understood by joy, but sustainable, long-lasting happiness involves recognising that there are many shades on the emotional palette.Research shows that occasionally accepting the presence of harder emotions means you experience them less intensely and for less time. In fact, the first step towards a joyful life may be letting go of your ideas of what that looks like – and recognising that it is down to you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/253a53ff66775895f9923f559f90660161e8103b/69_0_2778_1667/master/2778.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b30d3945f29c9e2c827e504128b7d21f","title":"surprising psychology behind being perpetually late","story":"There are as many reasons for unpunctuality as there are habitually tardy people – and the underlying reasons can be complexSometimes, one of my psychotherapy clients will be late. “The tube got stuck I do apologise.” If it happens once, I don’t treat it as significant. But some clients are perpetually late – perhaps just five or 10 minutes, but always – and out of breath when they get to the door. Then I am curious about what is behind their pattern of lateness, what it means and what purpose it serves.There are probably as many reasons for unpunctuality as there are habitually late people. Sometimes it seems unfathomable, but not always. One client remembered that his mother always spent so long in the bathroom that she made him late for school. She told him that it didn’t matter, and early people are uptight anyway. In his unconscious, being on time for things had got mixed up with being disloyal to his mother and therefore bad. Once he had found this narrative, he lost his compulsion for lateness.Punctual people may believe that late people are passive-aggressive and that their time is more valuable than those who wait for them. But reasons for lateness are generally more complex. The reason may be the opposite of arrogance. It could be that they don’t value themselves enough. If this is the case, might they be unable to see how others could possibly mind their non-appearance?This explanation may work for social situations, but why miss planes, boats and trains? Perhaps it is an unconscious testing of the theory: “If I were a worthy person, the train would wait for me.” Since it doesn’t, the feeling of not mattering is reinforced.One client I had kept thwarting her own attempts to succeed in her career, and bad time-keeping was part of this. When we unpicked what success would mean to her, she uncovered an old family belief that people with money were evil, bad people. Faced with a choice of not progressing or being evil, it was no wonder she kept up with the self-sabotage programme.Late people often have a sunny outlook. They are unreasonably optimistic about how many things they can cram in and how long it takes to get from the office to the restaurant, say, especially if it is nearby. My book editor and I often have lunch in a cafe next door to her office and she is always seven minutes late, because she leaves at 1pm. I think she believes she possesses a teleporter, yet, by the time she has chatted to a colleague in the lobby and waited for the lift, she is seven minutes late. I am considering getting there seven minutes late myself, except, as an early person with my own set of neuroses, that would make me ill with anxiety.Lateness can also be caused when we have a reluctance to change gear – to end one activity and start another. We don’t like getting up, we put off going to bed. Stopping something we are absorbed in to do something else can be annoying. It takes willpower to carry out. But if we don’t change gear in time when someone is waiting for us, we are in danger of being judged as selfish.Some late people choose to accept that they are terrible timekeepers and that they can’t do anything about it. Yet punctual people think they know that late people could decide to be on time and follow through.It is only when the latecomers make the decision to be punctual that they change. It must be a conscious decision if they merely make a woolly attempt to “try” to be on time, they won’t be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d81d2772bf09f0310ec758b57402de8257b2bf75/262_853_4659_2795/master/4659.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6d78a4c2f1c46405d725a34d535503a","title":"new year celebrations around the world in pictures","story":"Revellers have bid farewell to a decade that will be remembered for, among other things, the rise of social media, the Arab spring, the MeToo movement and Donald Trump"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ec69f9f8ce9aa1d241f6b3cfc4b741fb6863986/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7ce7c22a8015ed8848a52d21562516b","title":"new coins 2020 celebrate agatha christie tokyo olympians george iii ve day","story":"Royal Mint will also mark George III’s reign and VE Day 75th anniversary in 2020King George III’s reign and the 75th anniversary of VE Day are due to be commemorated on coins released this year, the Royal Mint has revealed.The new British coin collection will also mark 100 years since Dame Agatha Christie published her first novel and celebrate Team GB in the lead-up to the Tokyo Olympic Games.Marking 200 years since the end of King George III’s reign, a new £5 coin will commemorate his time on the throne.

We’re increasingly experiencing unseasonal heatwaves, dangerous flooding and extreme weather,” explains WWF climate change specialist, Isabella O’Dowd. “The government, businesses and iniduals have an important role to play in reaching the UK’s climate change targets. Right now, people want to know what they can do to help mitigate the effects of climate change.”In the past year, the climate crisis has shifted from 11th place to third place on the list of people’s concerns in WWF’s monthly public opinion poll, just behind the NHS and Brexit. This year has also seen high-profile global youth climate strikes and Extinction Rebellion protests. In addition, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2019 report stresses that it will be impossible to keep global temperatures at safe levels unless greenhouse gas emissions are reduced in all sectors, including land and food. As a result, more people recognise that climate breakdown isn’t abstract. It’s not a threat affecting remote communities, or far away in the distant future – it’s happening here and now.The climate and nature crisis is already accelerating so many human-induced influences on our planet – from the destruction of vast areas of rainforest in the Amazon to the collapse of bee populations. As more species become endangered, including one-third of all insects globally, the ecosystems that we all rely on become more fragile.With such astonishing loss of bioersity and habitat, planet Earth is much more likely to reach irreversible tipping points. Environmental breakdown is inevitable if we continue this unsustainable consumption of fossil fuels.Mark Wright, WWF’s director of science, hopes that environmental issues will be at the top of the agenda for political leaders: “Attitudes are shifting and now we need a step-change – the UK government needs to take radical steps to meet its target for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.”WWF climate experts estimate that net-zero could be achieved much sooner than the current 2050 target if we act now, but that calls for fundamental changes to the UK’s outdated energy infrastructure. Historically, the UK has been one of the biggest emitters and has an important role to fully decarbonise our energy system as quickly as possible. We need to make the energy greener and develop a more resilient smart system, as O’Dowd explains: “Our grid needs to be flexible so it can better manage supply and demand as we transition to more renewable energy. By equipping every home with a smart meter, power can be adjusted on a local and national level so the system is more energy efficient.”O’Dowd describes smart meters as “the enabler”, and they will undoubtedly be integral to the transition towards a low-carbon economy. To facilitate innovation, the government has pledged to offer every home and small business in the country a smart meter in the next few years – to date about 15.6m smart meters have been installed nationwide. “Smart meters allow consumers to understand their own energy use, and, with information from the in-home display, customers can start making small, money-saving changes such as switching off appliances which aren’t in use.”The government estimates that £650m of energy gets wasted in the current distribution system, travelling from where it is generated to the point it reaches our homes. Smart meters can help reduce loss in energy by accurately forecasting demand and using more low-cost and renewable energy. “We need to ramp up our wind power and solar generation in order to reach our 2050 target of net-zero, but these renewables don’t have an easy route to market,” says O’Dowd. “We want to push the government to raise its ambition – we know the technology exists and solutions are there but we need government support and its investment in our grid network to help that transition.”Ultimately, a smart energy system will generate, distribute and use energy much more efficiently. At a national network level, a more flexible infrastructure will use energy storage, for example via batteries or heating, and will shift demand away from peak periods, because when demand is highest, more of the electricity we consume is generated by polluting coal stations.In conjunction with the University of Oxford, Environmental Defense Fund Europe, and WWF, the National Grid has created a carbon intensity forecast that predicts the generation mix for the next four days in each region of the country. Energy users can enter their postcode and find out when the best time is to access green, clean energy. If your washing machine has a timer, you can set it to run at night, for example, when demand is low and more of the system’s energy is generated by renewables. In homes with solar panels, it might make sense to use electricity at midday if the sun is shining.As the smart energy system becomes more interactive with advanced technology, smart meters will play a part in allowing the shift to more staggered night-time charging for electric car batteries to minimise carbon emissions and keep costs down. In the future, this management could become automatic, with more widespread “time-of-use” tariffs. Local peer-to-peer trading could become more commonplace so consumers could more easily trade the excess energy they generate from solar panels. And perhaps the carbon intensity forecast might one day be reported alongside the weather.The Committee on Climate Change states that to reach our 2050 net-zero emissions target, we must reduce our carbon emissions by 15m tonnes a year, every year, starting now. “We’re in a rapidly changing world in terms of bioersity loss, habitat destruction and climate change, so we’re heading into uncharted territory,” says Wright. “We are clever and technologically savvy, so we may be able to cope with what the world throws at us in the future, but is that a world we want?” he asks, adding that as the climate changes, we’ll need to adapt quickly.For WWF, adopting smart meters is just one of the small changes we can each make, that our power companies do for us, that will help the overall system. It adds that smart meters help us to make changes to our power use – at a national, regional and domestic level – in ways that help cut emissions, which we need to do rapidly and deeply if we are to tackle the climate emergency.Wright says: “To feed the growing population in a world with more extreme weather events, increased flooding and rising sea temperatures, we’ll have to farm crops differently – we might need to start growing novel varieties of crops that are better suited to the environments of the future.” In order to have this capacity to adapt, we need to protect bioersity, on land and in the sea – every species plays a vital role in these ecosystems.“Nature rewards the patient – every species has a story to tell, even little beetles and velvet worms. If you allow nature to tell you its stories, you’ll unravel a real tapestry of life. We will be poorer if we continue to unpick that.”Part of Britain’s commitment to creating a more sustainable, low-carbon future includes making our energy network “smarter” – implementing digital tech to make our energy system more responsive to increased demand and variable wind speed. By collecting data on our energy use through smart meters, our network can better understand, plan for and balance out peaks and troughs in demand, making it easier to integrate renewable energy sources.This article was paid for by Smart Energy GB, a government-backed organisation tasked with informing Great Britain about the smart meter rollout."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01c1b4657ba7312bd0e8d362a78ac39d9426539a/0_182_5059_3036/master/5059.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af5ec0d8b58a897edb1fd389ca058787","title":"my house would only let good people in how kids see their homes of the future","story":"From houses that speak to you to magnifying glasses on the roof for energy, we take a glimpse into the future through the eyes of our youngest generation Fynn Rodell, 11: ‘The sun will heat my oven’I’m going to have loads of tech on my house to make it carbon neutral. I’ll have a wind turbine on the roof to generate electricity for lighting. There will be solar panels on the front door for more energy, and a magnifying glass on the roof to focus the sun’s heat for my oven. A vent will help suck the heat in and spread it around the house for extra heating when I’m not cooking. There will be a smart meter in the house to see how much energy I’m creating and how much I’m using.I’ll grow plants on the roof for insulation, to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and for insects to live there.The turbine on the roof will also power a water cleanser, so I can turn rainwater into drinking and washing water. I’ll have a toilet vacuum like on an airplane so that I don’t waste much water.Rosabela O’Selle-Goncalves, seven: ‘My house will say good things to you if you help the environment’In my house of the future the door should be brown, the house should be peach, and the roof should be red. There wouldn’t be much made from plastic, because if the plastic gets in the rivers it kills the animals.If you do really good things the house will see it and say good things about you because you’re helping the environment. It might say bad stuff if you ruin the environment, or it won’t speak to you.I would like that to happen – it’d be very nice for the house to look and speak to you because it’ll make you feel happy.My house would be medium-sized and you wouldn’t need keys, it would open if I put my hand on the door, but if a stranger put their hand on it, it wouldn’t open. It would know if people coming to the house were good or bad and would only let good people in.It wouldn’t have loads of food because it’s bad for the environment to waste it. To get water you don’t turn a tap on, you press a button and tell it how much water you want. When I walk in the lights will go on and if I leave they go off.Indy Williams, six: ‘Animals that have lost their habitats can come and live with us’In the future, my house will have solar panels on the roof to generate electricity for the TV, maybe a wind turbine too. We’ll still have our pet cats, but if other animals have lost their habitats then they can come and live with us as well. There’ll be a sliding door to the garden where we keep our bikes and also grow tomatoes, cucumbers and pomegranates.In the winter, all the inside walls will be covered in sheep’s wool so the house will be all cosy, like the inside of a slipper. We’ll have small windows and very big windows because it’s nice to have lots of sun, but not when you’re asleep. In the summer we’ll have a street party where no one will smoke or use plastic.Arianna Burke, nine: ‘A robot will sense when you’re wasting energy’I believe environmentally friendly homes of the future will have light switches that switch off in an hour or two when no one is inside.I think there would also be some sort of robot that senses if devices like the TV are on and knows whether people are there or not, and if not, it switches them off. I also think all houses should have solar panels on them automatically when they are built.Rai Rodell, nine: ‘I’ll collect rainwater for animals to drink’I’m going to have lots of animals in my house and in my garden. I’m going to grow food in the garden for me and my animals, and some seeds for the birds. I’ll put bird boxes on the roof so they have somewhere to live.The balcony will shelter the outdoor animals when it rains.

There is a lot to do.”Underpinning the latest grab for the loyalty and bucks of the game’s worldwide audience of millions is a turgid rivalry between the organisers of the two competitions, one towards the end of the longest season in sport, and this one at the beginning.The Association of Tennis Professionals (an uneasy conglomerate who have their internal rows to sort out) have for years urged compromise with the International Tennis Federation, the game’s long-time s who grew more desperate by the season as leading players refused to fit the old home-and-away Davis Cup into their busy and lucrative schedules.It is a towering irony that the most innovative administrator the game has had in decades, Chris Kermode, has been levered out of his job as the ATP’s executive chairman and president – the result of an unseemly feud with the world No 2, Novak Djokovic – on the eve of the launch of his latest experiment. Kermode will be watching his new baby from a distance, pleased at least that it will introduce many of the ideas he road-tested in the NextGen Cup for the game’s rising stars.By general consensus, the new Davis Cup, driven by the Barcelona footballer Gerard Pique and won by the home country on the back of another extraordinary contribution from Rafael Nadal, worked well enough, albeit with plenty of fine-tuning to be done before the next final there towards the end of 2020.So the ATP Cup has to at least reach that benchmark, and Ross Hutchins, the competition’s managing director who will oversee its genesis in Brisbane, Perth and Sydney, scene of the final on 12 January, brings a smile and confidence to his task.Among the new bells and whistles will be the game’s quick-fire and hopefully less controversial version of VAR, a video review operating courtside to sort out double bounces, foul shots, touches or invasion. Teams will occupy corners of stadiums, rather than sitting along either side of the umpire, and will be armed with an array of technology and statistics to aid on-court coaching.The group stages will be played over the first six days and the tournament will then move to Sydney for a four-day knockout in the Final Eight, before everyone heads for Melbourne and the Australian Open on 20 January, a caravan of millionaires, as ever, unsure of their final destination.In an optimistic twist, there will be a new canopy over the Ken Rosewall Arena in Sydney, which will host Britain’s group stage as well as the final. If ever there was an appropriate time for the heavens to rain on a parade, it surely is in the tinder-dry settings of fire-ravaged NSW.Hutchins, meanwhile, will hope that a new audience can see through the lingering smoke to embrace a project designed to bring clarity to a sport wandering still through its own self-induced haze."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/555f05482f7a7fc22f15887823d3d27af6b11e75/467_212_4303_2582/master/4303.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14c836a6ddd84474f40f1294e9dde909","title":"dom bess second chance test cricket england south africa","story":"Somerset spinner’s fall after his first England stint was precipitous but he is back in contention at NewlandsWhen Ed Smith named his first England Test squad as national selector, it was notable for two contrasting cricketers from Somerset. The first, Jos Buttler, had long since left that nest and his wings expanded yet further from that point. As of this week, he has MBE next to his name. But the other who turned out for England against Pakistan last summer, Dom Bess, has been invisible since. That is until Friday in Cape Town, where he has bolted back into the box seat for inclusion.That he was called up to this squad on the basis of a veritable pandemic – now striking 17 of the touring party and support staff – suggests a mood of desperation given how far Bess, now 22, had ventured from prominence. However, they are also similar circumstances to those that won him his debut. Then, Moeen Ali was out of favour having prioritised white-ball above red after a shocking Ashes series and Jack Leach, who took over as principal spinner, was injured. Now, the former is again on the T20 circuit after losing his Test spot and contract after Australia tore his confidence apart in the Ashes opener last August, while the latter has spent the last week in quarantine, hit hardest by the bug that has decimated the ranks.Bess found out about his debut selection when Smith called him as he was sofa shopping. To then, a whirlwind two years had seen him claim five bags of five with his off-spin in his first six County Championship starts, another on debut for the England Lions in Antigua, before making a ton for the MCC in the annual season-opening fixture. Suddenly, he was readying himself to become the youngest finger spinner ever to represent his country in a Test match with Vic Marks – the Lord of this Parish, and another Somerset tweaker – presenting the cap.The next fortnight was eventful. To begin, he was wicketless and largely ineffective with the ball but compiled an assured 57 with the bat – mostly alongside Buttler – to give the hosts faint hope from an otherwise dire match. At Headingley, Bess made 49 further impressive runs (coming in as nightwatchman) before claiming his first three England wickets. He also snaffled a spectacular one-handed catch off Jimmy Anderson’s bowling, the veteran superstar who he could well end up replacing as Joe Root’s side reconfigure for the second Test.But when the Test side reassembled to play India in August 2018, he was overlooked for the returning Moeen. There were comforting words from Smith of Bess’s “outstanding all-round contribution” against Pakistan but there was a problem: he was no longer getting a game for his county. Already into the wilderness, demoted to Somerset’s second XI barely a month after contributing to a Test win. So often the lot in life of a spinner when competing for one spot, Leach – his county teammate, too – was the senior man with no further room at the inn. Bess’ dismount from 2018 was a nightmare against Lancashire, given only four overs with the ball then dismissed to a wild heave with the scores level in a game that would be tied.“I got to the top of Mount Everest with the Test stuff and then fell off,” Bess would later reflect of the chastening experience. Somerset’s coach, Jason Kerr, observed that firsthand. “It doesn’t matter who you are that’s incredibly tough,” he says of the acute fall. “He had this meteoric rise where everything he touched turned to gold and was playing at Lord’s in a Test Match. To deal with that immense high and playing second-team cricket just a few weeks later, it was a turbulent time and he found it very difficult. But he has matured a hell of a lot and is much clearer in terms of knowing there are only certain things he can control. He’s a much stronger character now and will be a much better cricketer for it in the long term.”The turbulence morphed into a move during 2019, albeit on a temporary basis, to Yorkshire. A product of the Somerset Academy, he was now on loan at the ground where he played most recently for England. Alas, after four starts (and a later spell at Leeds in the T20 Blast), Bess was back to Taunton for the final stretch of the season. On his return, he claimed his first five-wicket haul for two seasons, finishing with 26 scalps at a useful average of 26.“It is easy to get his head turned regarding having certain opportunities,” Kerr says of Yorkshire’s interest in Bess, with Kent also apparently sniffing around. “He’s obviously very ambitious and wants to get back to the giddy heights of international cricket sooner rather than later. But we have been very transparent with him: we think he is an incredibly talented cricketer. We certainly want him to be at Somerset for the long haul. He obviously has competition at Somerset but is still one of the better spinners in the country. We have to try and find a way to keep them both.”Amid the volatility, Bess remained in the thinking of decision-makers to the extent that he was taken on a Lions spin camp in Mumbai this winter. There, under the tutelage of Sri Lanka’s Rangana Herath and former England twirler Richard Dawson, he impressed sufficiently to become the man to call for when Leach fell ill. Coming in hot, he has already bowled himself ahead of Matt Parkinson, the leg-spinner originally sent on tour in support of Leach. His strength with the bat surely stands out in the memory too, given the long tail that was exposed twice against South Africa when an all-pace attack was deployed.Whether Bess is ripe for the challenge at Newlands – especially for bowling long, frugal spells to keep the seamers fresh – the coming days will tell. Yes, it’s likely that, unless he can win selection as much for his batting as his bowling, come April he will be back to second-team cricket – again behind Leach – and might take a while before this is no longer the status quo for club or country. Or he might bowl the house down and turn that thinking on its head. After the last 18 months, what’s certain is that he won’t be lacking for motivation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2bbd5a6f95550bca682c29480084cfe6456168f/775_816_2776_1665/master/2776.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f06933b1be7392d8d1db35597d6df96","title":"jofra archer injury doubt second cricket test south africa","story":"England were sweating on the fitness of Jofra Archer ahead of the second Test against South Africa with the paceman unable to bowl in practice on Wednesday due to a sore right elbow. Archer was able to bat in the nets and also took part in fielding drills in Cape Town but could not bowl, the England and Wales Cricket Board said.The 24-year-old finished with match figures of six for 167 off 34 overs as England lost the first Test in Centurion by 107 runs. The second Test of the four-match series starts at Newlands on Friday.Archer’s absence from the bowling group could settle what was shaping up to be a potentially tricky selection debate. If England choose to draft in a specialist spinner at Newlands, and initial verdicts on the pitch appeared to favour one, then one seamer must make way.All-rounder Sam Curran turned in a highly impressive performance in Centurion and offers variety as a left-armer, which had turned the heat up on the senior pair of James Anderson and Stuart Broad – the two most prolific bowlers in England’s Test history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8ad50a894c9d751665bfebb062119fdf66663c3/0_418_4300_2580/master/4300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=404a0dd94fbcce192c9745fde814d161","title":"peter wright ready to shock michael van gerwen and win first pdc world title","story":"Peter Wright insists he is “ready” to be world champion and put his poor record in finals behind him by shocking Michael van Gerwen in Wednesday’s PDC world championship final.The 49-year-old won a bad-tempered semi-final against Gerwyn Price but knows he will have to raise his game against the defending champion and world No 1, who has cruised to the final without finding his best form so far.“I want to play the best player in the world, the No 1, the guy who wins all the titles – or the titles I have given him,” Wright said to Sky Sports. “But he will be playing a different Wrighty tomorrow, and this Wrighty will be up for MvG.”“I have not been in the final since 2014,” said Wright, who lost that final to Van Gerwen 7-4. “I was not ready to be world champion then, he deserved to be world champion and has done a fantastic job being the world champion.”“But this time, I think I am ready I know I am ready. I have learned a lot in all of those years, have matured more. I have learned from mistakes, and MvG will be playing a new Wrighty, not the old Wrighty ... it is my time, that is why I am here.”Van Gerwen is targeting a fourth world crown after beating Nathan Aspinall 6-3 in his semi-final, and sought to remind Wright of their head-to-head record. The Dutchman has won 59 of their meetings, compared to Wright’s 17. The Suffolk-based player who represents Scotland, where he was born, has lost 10 out of the 11 major finals he has played –\u0026nbspwith seven of those defeats coming against Van Gerwen. Wright has lost Premier League and Champions League finals to Van Gerwen after missing match darts. “Against me, he is not allowed to miss those doubles, so we will see what is going to happen and I need to make sure I play a bit better than him. Until the semi-final, I had a higher tournament average than he did, and everyone is saying he is playing quite well, so that must say what my standard is.”Van Gerwen added that Wright is “playing really well” at Alexandra Palace and that his opponent is due a landmark win – “but it won’t be this week, that’s for sure.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e88b65fa56ca61c983ddf9c0975a2d8328a194b/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36c580416e76af1a707f68b5d20e1051","title":"twenty athletes set to light up tokyo 2020 olympics","story":"Our writers choose the Olympians likely to make the headlines at the most anticipated sporting event of the yearSeb Coe, who knows a thing or two about winning Olympic titles, believes Asher-Smith will be Team GB’s “poster girl” in Tokyo. Given her seamless upward trajectory and personality it would take a brave person to argue with his lordship. Last autumn the 24-year-old won three world championship medals, including the 200m title, making her the greatest British female sprinter in history. Next year she will have live chances of Olympic gold in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay – although Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Shaunae Miller-Uibo and the USA 4x100m team will have a thing or two (or three) to say about that. Sean IngleBarber’s seasonal best chart over the past decade shows almost linear improvement. The 28-year-old javelin thrower finished 20th at the 2015 world championships, 10th two years later and upset a talented field last September to clinch gold. Barber is no stranger to high-pressure competition, having won medals at consecutive Commonwealth Games and competed in Rio, but Tokyo will be her first outing as the athlete to beat. Following several retirements, Barber and the high-jumper Brandon Starc are Australia’s only established medal hopes in track and field. Kieran PenderThe 22-year-old American nonpareil, who affirmed her presumptive status as the greatest gymnast ever with four gold medals in seven days in Rio, has continued to rewrite the record books while somehow raising her level at the past two world championships. She will enter Tokyo as a runaway favourite to become the oldest woman in more than five decades to win the Olympic all-around title, the sport’s most coveted prize, and the first repeat champion since Vera Caslavska did it for the former Czechoslovakia in 1968. As ever, her only competition is herself. Bryan Armen GrahamIf Brown qualifies for Tokyo – and she is almost a shoo-in – she will be only 12 years and 15 days on the opening day of skateboarding, eclipsing the swimmer Margery Hinton to become the youngest British athlete to ever compete at an Olympics. Brown, who was born in Japan to an English father and Japanese mother, is improving at such a rate it is impossible to put limits on where she might finish – in September she was third in the São Paulo Park World Championships. SIThe soft-spoken 23-year-old from Atlanta has, over the past three seasons, established himself as the warm favourite to succeed Usain Bolt as the Olympic 100m champion, most recently in September when he surged to the world title in a personal-best time of 9.76sec that made him the sixth-fastest man in history. His reputation took a hit when the US Anti-Doping Agency charged him with three whereabouts failures in a 12-month period – an offence that carries a potential two-year ban – but a defiant Coleman has kept on course for a Tokyo coronation after the case was dropped. BAGA mercurial cyclist specialising in the race against the clock, Dennis, 29, raised eyebrows when he walked out on his WorldTour team Bahrain Merida midway through the Tour de France. While he has not ridden for them since, and is currently in a contractual dispute, that did not stop Dennis from defending his world time trial crown in September. Having recently signed with Ineos, who seem agreeable to Dennis focusing on the Olympics, the South Australian is a strong favourite for time trial gold. KPThe 23-year-old from Florida has been cast as the heir to Michael Phelps as the face of swimming in the US and, potentially, the world. The freestyle, breaststroke and butterfly sprint specialist equalled Phelps’s world championships record with seven gold medals in Budapest two years ago, followed by six golds and two silvers at last year’s worlds in Gwangju. Dressel has played down suggestions he would add the 4x200m free relay to his Tokyo schedule – and make a run at Phelps’s epochal eight-gold haul from Beijing 2008 – but even so seven golds remain in his sights. BAGClimbing will be one of the starry new attractions at Tokyo 2020 – and Garnbret is expected to shine brightest of all. The 20-year-old has been described as a “reincarnated spider monkey” because of her ability to scale walls and in 2019 she become the first athlete to win every bouldering World Cup event in a season. She won the world titles in bouldering and combined climbing in 2018 and 2019 and is also rapidly improving in her weakest discipline, speed climbing, making her heavy favourite for Olympic gold. SIA seven-times world champion, the surfer from Tweed Heads will represent Australia alongside her compatriot Sally Fitzgibbons in the sport’s Olympic debut. The perennially consistent Gilmore, 31, won the 2018 World Surf League and finished fourth last year. If she can overcome the likes of Fitzgibbons and the Hawaiian Carissa Moore, the natural-footer will have a real shot at gold. It would be a fitting triumph, given Gilmore and her country’s consistent surfing success over the past decade. KPSkateboarding debuts as a medal event in Tokyo and the three-times world champion from Laguna Beach is widely regarded as the gold medal favourite in men’s street. The 25-year-old is a long-established star in the skate world, having amassed more than 3.7 million Instagram followers, a signature Nike shoe and more prize money than any other skateboarder in history since making his X Games debut aged 11. Huston will headline a US team that includes another gold medal favorite in Hawaii’s Heimana Reynolds, the reigning world champion in the park discipline. BAGKenny is already Britain’s most successful female Olympian with four gold medals across London 2012 and Rio 2016. British Cycling insiders say that three more could arrive in Tokyo in the team pursuit, omnium and, if selected, madison. Seven Olympic golds would take Kenny to the top of the Team GB medal pantheon, above her fellow track cyclists Sir Chris Hoy and her husband Jason, who both have six golds and a silver. However, with Jason also gunning for more glory in Tokyo it could yet be Kenny v Kenny for the title of the top Team GB athlete in history. SIThe extraordinary high jumper was a piping hot favourite for gold at the Rio 2016 Olympics – only to be barred from competition when the IAAF, track and field’s governing body, banned all Russians from the Games. She will go to Tokyo desperate to right that wrong, even if she ends up wearing the vest of a neutral athlete given Russia’s recent four-year ban. Don’t bet against it either, given Lasitskene has won an unprecedented three high jump world championship titles in 2015, 2017 and 2019. SIMcCartney, 23, rose to international prominence four years ago in Rio, claiming bronze as a teenager in her first major event. Having gone one better with a silver medal at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in 2018, the sky appeared to be the limit for the Auckland-born vaulter. A persistent achilles injury has hampered her last year, but having recently discovered the cause – a genetic disorder – there is hope she can overcome the problem and head to Tokyo fully fit and as one of New Zealand’s genuine gold medal contenders. KPBritain have won eight boxing medals in the past two Olympics, with Anthony Joshua, Luke Campbell and Nicola Adams all making the highest step of the podium before having decorated pro careers. Many expect McCormack, a classy light-welterweight who has won Commonwealth and European Games titles, to follow in their gold-laced footsteps. Last year he reached the final of the world championships, only to lose to the Russian Andrey Zamkovoy. But with question marks over Russia’s participation, he could go off as favourite in Tokyo. SIThe 23-year-old from Ontario has won every major 100m backstroke race she has entered since capturing a surprise bronze at the distance as a teenager in Rio, becoming the first Canadian swimmer to win back-to-back world titles in the same event. Masse, who has been tipped to become her country’s first Olympic backstroke champion since Mark Tewksbury in 1992, will headline a Canadian team including Penny Oleksiak, Maggie MacNeil, Taylor Ruck and Sydney Pickrem that will enter Tokyo with medal chances up and down the programme. BAGRemember Michael Johnson winning 200m and 400m gold at Atlanta? Well, 24 years on, Miller-Uibo has a live chance of repeating Johnson’s extraordinary feat. Not only is she the reigning 400m Olympic champion, she was also the fastest over 200m in 2019 – beating Dina Asher-Smith easily when they met. However, the schedule might yet thwart her in Tokyo. As things stand she would have to run a 400m heat on the morning before trying to win gold in the 200m final in the evening. Yet don’t bet against it being Miller-Uibo time in 2020. SIOsaka has had an up and down 2019 but she is still the reigning Australian Open champion and ranked No 3 in the world. And crucially, her decision in October to represent the country of her birth, Japan, rather than the US – a country where she has dual citizenship – means she will be one of the stories of the Games. “It is a special feeling to aim for the Olympics as a representative of Japan,” she said recently. “I think that playing with the pride of the country will make me feel more emotional.” SIJapan might have invented judo, but no one has dominated the sport more than Big Teddy Riner. The 6ft 8in and 20st Frenchman not only has two Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016 to his name, along with a bronze in Beijing as a teenager in 2008, but has won a record 10 world titles. The last time he was beaten? September 2010. If the Frenchman takes gold again he will join Tadahiro Nomura on three Olympic titles – and the ominous news for his rivals is that he intends he continue until Paris 2024. SIOf course Adam Peaty will be the fulcrum of Team GB in the pool, having blasted to 100m breaststroke gold – and followed it up with 4x100m medley silver – in Rio. But don’t forget Scott. Not only did he anchor Britain to 4x100m relay gold at last year’s world championships and win bronze in the 200m freestyle, he also made global headlines by refusing to shake hands with the controversial Chinese swimmer Sun Yang. If Yang survives his doping case, the rematch in Tokyo will be tasty. SIAustralian swimming has been in the doldrums, but the wonderkid Titmus is determined to propel them back up the medal table in Tokyo. The teenager spectacularly beat Katie Ledecky in the 400m freestyle at the world championships in 2019, in an event in which the American superstar had been undefeated since 2012. The rematch should be thrilling, and Titmus is also a strong contender in the 200m, 800m and relays. After winning three golds and a silver at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, the Tasmanian will hope for an even more bountiful haul.

Here are our six top tips to keep it safe in the new yearTechnology is changing our lives for the better yet it’s also exposing us to organised crime, online scammers and hackers – and whole industries built around monetising our personal data. But you don’t have to be resigned to cyber-victimhood. Give yourself, and your devices, a security update for 2020 and start fighting back.Yes, seriously. Your smartphone is a treasure trove of data, and while your passwords are likely to be safe from prying eyes (your password manager will keep them encrypted), what about your email, social media apps, contacts etc? Criminals can use these to change passwords, take account control away from you, and commit fraud in your name or simply steal directly from you. “Most people do not set any lock code on their devices,” warns Fennel Aurora, security adviser at F-Secure. A long password is most secure. Even if you’ve set up a fingerprint scan to unlock your phone, it will ask for your pin or password after a few unsuccessful attempts. A thief can try to guess your pin (and 0000 is still a common option) or obvious password. Smartphones can be configured to automatically perform a factory reset, wiping all your data, after a certain number of incorrect unlock attempts. For Android check SettingsSecurity \u0026amp LocationScreen lock, and on iPhones, SettingsFace ID \u0026amp passcodeErase data.While you may have read about smart speakers being at risk from hackers with maliciously crafted audio tracks or lasers (yes, seriously), in the real world there are more pressing security and privacy issues to consider. The account holder can see any requests that have been made of the device worth remembering when using one at a friend’s house. To prevent this, tell Alexa to “delete what I just said”, and Google Assistant to “delete my last conversation”. That’s assuming they have enabled the “delete by voice” option in the account settings, of course – which,. as a courtesy to your friends and family, I’d recommend doing for your smart speakers. While in the account settings, you can also delete past recordings for good measure. Using the “voice match” function for Google Assistant can prevent your personal results being available to anyone but you, and possibly Jon Culshaw. If you have enabled purchasing and have one-click payments “on” for your Amazon account, you can set a spoken pin to stop others shopping on your behalf and at your cost.If there’s one thing hackers really don’t like, it’s a liar. Especially if the fibs relate to those security questions sites ask you to answer as an identification method should you need to reset a forgotten password. “Most of the answers to security questions like these are easily acquired by hackers,” Tom Lysemose Hansen, founder of mobile app security vendor Promon, explains, “using simple trial-and-error methods based on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and even Wikipedia data, which give away much of our personal and family details.” Indeed, it’s incredible, and incredibly worrying, what a simple Google search can uncover. Instead of being honest about your mother’s maiden name, your place of birth, where you went to school or what you called your first pet, lie like a politician at election time. Of course, remembering fibs is harder than remembering the truth, and as with passwords, it’s best to avoid reusing the same ones for every site. Password manager apps can help, as they have a secure notes entry for every login.There has been much coverage of “juice jacking” of late. This involves a cybercriminal using altered USB charging ports in airports, train stations and hotels to infect your device with malware. You can carry a USB charger that plugs into a power socket or invest in a power-only USB charging cable to prevent this. A more widespread problem is that of free wireless internet access. “Criminals can exploit public wifi to steal your personal information, such as emails, photos, passwords, private documents and bank details,” Oz Alashe, CEO of CybSafe, says. Using a virtual private network (VPN) is recommended to reduce the risk. A VPN app creates an encrypted “tunnel” between your device and a remote server, protecting your data from snooping hackers. If you’re using your phone to check your bank balance or pay bills on the train or in the coffee shop, a VPN provides “a safety blanket that will help keep your data out of the wrong hands”, Matt Lock, technical director at Varonis, says.

Writers, artists and adventurers share their ideas for kickstarting the year aheadThe important thing on New Year’s Day – as on most days over Christmas – is to get out. If you don’t manage it by about midday, suddenly it’s dusk and too late.Living in Cornwall makes you a sitting target for visitors, and we normally have an assortment of friends and family packed into our house. There’s a favourite cove a few miles away, behind Nare Head. It’s hard to see from the track above, and the squelchy route down and the cliff-scramble mean that, even in summer, there’s rarely anyone else there. The bay is a great gatherer of driftwood (as well as less-flammable flotsam – random shoes, gloves, bath toys, broken fish boxes and cobles…). We build a fire and drink hot soup and cook sausages. If there’s a swell running, and the tides are low, some of us will tug on wetsuits and boots and try the surf – others might dash in for a new year’s baptismal dip.To one side of the beach, the cliff has been cut into, forming gullies – or “zawns”, from the Cornish. You can swim into these and feel the sea surge in and rise and fall against the rocks while you bob, cork-like, upon them, contemplating the ups and downs of the coming year.• Philip Marsden’s most recent book is The Summer Isles: A Voyage of the ImaginationThe flanks of Dartmoor are always whitened with frost and hidden icicles on new year’s morning. This is where I set out to, with snow boots, flasks of hot tea and my loved ones.Often, we make our way up to Wistman’s Wood. This grizzled place is one of the few original ancient oak woods left on the moor, and it feels enchanted. From a distance, its furze of stunted oaks set among the clutter of granite boulders looks unremarkable, but inside is a muscular wood-world of moss boulders and ankle-turning tangles of trunks, roots and loopy beards of lichen.Here, we sit in the stillness between weather patterns and think about our resolutions – what the old year has been and what we wish for the new. Among the trees, we listen to the high, glassy crepitation of twigs conversing from their coatings of ice, poised for the next incoming skitter of cold.There is something safe about a wood in winter: its spacious leaflessness allows you to see your way out, and in the “dimpsey” light we drink steaming tea and watch shadows move around us. Wistman’s Wood is a sheltering place – very slightly uncanny, and good for invoking wishes – but not one in which to linger too long.• Miriam Darlington is author of Otter CountryMelissa Harrison, nature writer and novelistFor the decade between my mid-twenties and mid-thirties, I missed every single New Year’s Day.Often I was out dancing and doing shots and chatting nonsense with friends and strangers: in a dark, windowless club, perhaps, or at a raucous house party with all the blinds drawn. Sometimes I spent it spark out under a duvet, recovering from the night before. Either way, the day just didn’t exist for me: events like the Oxford Street sales, or London’s New Year’s Day Parade, were purely mythical. I never even saw the sun.Another decade on and things are different. Since moving to Suffolk, I’ve made a point of going for a proper walk on 1 January so I can think, and feel, and breathe, and see the new year in.More than once on my rambles I’ve come across people botanising, which may seem unlikely given the time of year. But it turns out the New Year Plant Hunt, now nine years old, is fast becoming A Thing: volunteers across the country head out and record whatever’s flowering at nyph.bsbi.org, the results analysed by the Botanical Society of Britain \u0026amp Ireland to shed light on our changing weather.It seems to me a powerful ritual, as well as providing useful data: like the clubs I’ve left behind, it’s a quest for life and promise and colour at the chill, drab turning of the year.• Melissa Harrison’s All Among the Barley won the European Union Prize for Literature in 2019On 1 January at Holyrood Park in Edinburgh you might expect to see families taking a refreshing stroll, or folks walking off hangovers from their big night. But you will be surprised: hundreds of Lycra-clad triathletes will be thundering through the park, cycling and running. Yes it is likely to be cold, wet and windy, possibly even snowy, but for 25 years the park has hosted a sprint-distance triathlon – there have been Olympic- and world-level athletes out on course alongside many hundreds of first-time triathletes. Each year, around half the field are first-timers, and in the past few years the number of women competing has overtaken the men.The swim is over 400 metres indoors at the Royal Commonwealth Pool (breaking ice on the local lochs is just a step too far). Then the hardy souls take to their bikes for a three-lap, 10-mile route around Arthur’s Seat, with a substantial hill to be climbed on each lap. Lastly, it’s one more run around the park, before heading for the finish line to be rewarded with a medal and to bask in the glory of becoming a New Year’s Day triathlete.• edinburghtri.orgMidnight: a beach and a driftwood fire, South Skye or west coast Mull. Starlight, moonlight, then the aurora. Then listen. To the night, to the sea, to the voices of the winter dark.Grey seals singing as the tide ebbs and frees the haul-out rocks. Owl-to-owl call, kee-wick to whoo-oo. Then try and count the owls. Fox, triple bark (the dog), mating season scream (the vixen, hair-raising). Whooper swan restlessness scored for muted brass on a hidden lochan just above the beach. And listen to the fire talking to itself through the wee hours, and to each other.The tenor of New Year’s Day is established between the hours of midnight and sunrise.Then, stir the fire, make porridge, and through the daylight hours walk the island until you find an unplanned destination (you know it when you get there).Then, a cottage with the sea across the street. Bath with good whisky. Dinner with good wine. Toast: Bliadhna mhath ur dhuinn – A good New Year to Us. Who with? Oh, she knows, she knows.• Jim Crumley’s latest book is The Nature of SpringBecause I am a ritual sun ray-gatherer – particularly at this winter solstice time of year, when the sun’s early descent is so fiery and intense – my lone spirit plus dog will long for the hills on New Year’s Day. My children and I raise our heads above the parapet of festive fugs. The coast will be clear. We’ll turn away from the glistening sea to head inland to elevations west of the Folkestone Downs near Peene Quarry or Etchinghill.For a while we’ll walk and talk. Then, from across the flow and glow of golden-flanked Down, we’ll be dazzled by an ever-changing veil of rose-tinted ambers and yellows that sweep across our vision, till the orb, departed behind Summerhouse and Tolsford Hills, turns the once-gilded grasses white and colourless in the not-yet-dark.Jade and Dan Scott, adventure guidesNew Year’s Day for us isn’t about making up guilt-ridden resolutions as punishment for indulging in too many mince pies it’s an opportunity to pause and look back at the year behind, to celebrate all the little wins in life and all the happy moments that we made happen for us and others – to remind ourselves of what makes us who we are and what we need to keep doing in the future to keep happy.We like to be with our favourite people, doing simple things, sharing time in nature, no big gestures. We gather up family and friends and head down the South West Coast Path to one of our special places, Pondfield Cove, at Worbarrow Bay beneath the watchful eye of Worbarrow Tout. This is the smaller and lesser-known beach of the two that our children like to think is their own secret cove, and we like to let them think that..We light fires and play pirates, search for sea glass and driftwood, seaweed and wild herbs. We cook a warming stew over the flames and eat it out of tin mugs. The kids get filthy and run free and there’s always one mad person in the party who can’t stay out of the sea!• Jade and Dan Scott run sea kayaking and bushcraft courses in Dorset, foreadventureFor the past few years I’ve spent New Year’s Day on the south coast of Ireland. Egged on by my adventurous cousins, this is where I first got a taste for winter swimming. The first day of the year always involves a swim off Goat Island, in County Waterford, as sausages cook in the sand.Last August I decided to make Dover my home. I moved into a Regency crescent by the castle and from here I can see the waves crash into the harbour below. To beat creeping feelings of isolation I started tentatively dipping myself into the sea but as autumn has turned to winter these outings have become a necessary daily fix, where no day feels complete without a half-hour swim in the Channel.I now structure my work hours around tide timetables and, come rain or shine, I clip on my fluorescent tow float, pull on my neoprene gloves, and roll into the waves. Often going in naked – to titillate the looming border patrol – I dodge the ferries and aim for France. Every day feels like New Year’s Day.Kate Rew, founder of The Outdoor Swimming SocietyI like a good time but New Year’s Eve has always been too much pressure for my wayward ways. I prefer New Year’s Day. I like starting the year relatively fresh, and ending the day in a clean bed, beaten and battered by exertion and weather. At some point I generate inconceivably long lists that boil down to “get fit, drink less, write something and do yoga”.Maximum time outside is different every year. Three years ago my husband and I double-dipped, first in fancy dress at the Lyme Lunge in Lyme Regis, Dorset, then under a supermoon. Two years ago we walked up and down Sugarloaf mountain in Monmouthshire. Last year we cycled what felt like the whole of Somerset.A swimmer I know puts her resolutions in a frame in the downstairs loo, so she (and everyone else) can see them. This year I’m doing the same, which is already making me reframe them in other ways. The same four core points will undoubtedly be the same, but I’m 50 now and this year – this year! – those dreams are coming true.• To find a New Year’s swim, see outdoorswimmingsocietyNew Year’s Eve is my worst night of the year. I always feel like I’m in the wrong place, or not having enough fun. By contrast, New Year’s Day is my favourite. I love the quiet, the sense that the world has temporarily fallen still. I’ve developed a tradition of using it to plan next year’s planting in my garden.First I walk at Wandlebury Park in the Gog Magog Hills in Cambridge, through the neglected orchards of a former stately home, and then I settle down with tea and the last of the sausage rolls, and sort through seed catalogues, sketching out border designs in my battered garden diary. My favourite is the austere Chiltern Seeds, which has no pictures, only wonderfully vivid and knowledgeable mini-essays.I love old-fashioned cottage garden plants: opium poppies, sweet peas like Black Knight and King Edward VII, candy-striped cosmos and tagetes. But like the Talented Mr Ripley, my true passion is for dahlias, especially the ones that look like sea anemones. It’s the best kind of dreaming to do at the hinge of the year, an investment in summer that always comes good, no matter what else 2020 might bring.• Olivia Laing’s collected essays, Funny Weather, is published by Picador in AprilRichard Skelton and Autumn Richardson, writers and musiciansOn New Year’s Eve we usually make a list of aspirations for the coming year, as well as reflecting on those of the year just gone. We often try to spend at least part of New Year’s Day trying to put those objectives into practice: beginning a new piece of writing, art or music. We also try to get outdoors, and for the past two winters we’ve been in the Scottish Borders, living close to Liddel Water — the river that further downstream forms the boundary between Scotland and England. There’s a path along its edge that we like to walk, skirting a threshold as we cross over into a new year.• corbelstonepressI feel fresher if I’ve written down all the unhelpful and hurtful things that my mind has accumulated over the year (harsh and unkind things said to my face, online or behind my back, including things I’ve said about myself), then gone to a river, a forest or garden – in London this will be Regent’s Park or Victoria Park – and burned them like a pile of paper grudges. This ritual helps me move forward, otherwise I become a wheel that has accumulated too much from old roads and I’ll never let them go. I go for long walks alone and listen to music with no lyrics: jazz, dance, funk, electronic, dub. Then I roll into the new year with friends and family and food – ackee and salt fish, and if dessert is going, it’s apple crumble and custard.• raymondantrobusLooking for a holiday with a difference?

But the CIA have other ideasIs he the messiah? Or is he a very naughty boy?These are the animating questions of the 10-part Netflix drama Messiah, a political thriller built around the advent in Syria of a young preacher man (played with grace, charm and passion by Mehdi Dehbi).He catches people’s attention by fearlessly urging them to set aside old isions and listen to his message of peace, love and unity, which seems to incorporate the best of most of the main religions. This is very generous of him, considering he also possesses a set of cheekbones upon which he could hang a new and very self-centred one. For what I suspect are a variety of spiritual, aesthetic and carnal reasons, his following soon grows in numbers.However, the CIA (particularly the agent Eva Geller – played by Michelle Monaghan – who is recently widowed and nursing a secret, possibly fatal, illness, because non-prophets are also interesting) is sceptical. Alongside assorted other cynical parties, the intelligence agency is not convinced that he is our saviour newly born to Earth. It runs him through its databases and finds no trace of him, but reckons he can only be either a con artist or a terrorist who has found a new way to bring about a war.The latter view looks increasingly probable as our lord of the cheekbones leads a group of Muslim refugees out of Damascus, after (as they come to see it) conjuring a sandstorm that spikes the guns of Isis just as they are about to take the city, and up to the border of Israel.He is arrested by the police and interrogated by Aviram (Tomer Sisley), a soldier in the Israeli army. The prophet seems to have unwarranted knowledge of his personal history. As a result, Aviram deletes the tape of their interview. This comes back to bite him when the high priest of the zygomatic arch pulls off his second apparent miracle and escapes from a locked cell overnight.After only a brief pause at Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem – to preach the maxillofacial word and heal a boy shot in front of him by trigger-happy police excited to be closing in on their escapee – the prophet next appears in the US, seemingly having saved a pastor’s daughter from a tornado (and indirectly preventing the debt-ridden pastor from torching his church for the insurance). The seeds of another following are sown. Unsurprisingly, the CIA is no more keen on the home-soil outpost than it was on the original.As the series goes on, the influence of social media and investigations into the potentially holy one’s motivations by old-fashioned “proper” journalists (represented by Jane Adams, playing a dogged CNN reporter called Miriam Keneally) add further layers of complexity. The whole thing is like Homeland, with a ine twist.However, the twist may already have been spoiled. Muslim Arabic speakers have complained that one of the names the writers have used for Zygoman translates as something that gives away the ending a hazard, these people say, of the writers borrowing names and iconography from a religion and a culture they don’t fully understand.Whether this is the case, or an elaborate multiple bluff is in play, Messiah is potent stuff packed with fine performances. My feeling is that, even if the show’s creators had only a basic understanding of the relevant religious and cultural considerations, the mistake being asserted by viewers would be quite difficult to make. I hope that the people behind a multicultural series that deals with Jewish and Muslim conflict had the sense to hire all sorts of experts to protect sensitivities and highlight potential problems – but perhaps I am being overly optimistic.Even in the earliest episodes, Messiah is capable of delivering gut punches – the flashback to Aviram holding a cloth over a boy’s face as he struggles for breath, for example – that surprise you into noticing how far you have been sucked in. Perhaps the fact that the show becomes so harrowing so fast, and is compelling throughout, is a sign that we are hardwired for hope – the man standing in front of me promises to end all human suffering – and programmed deeply to seek answers and invest in those who purport to provide them. I have no saviour to turn to, and if one appeared I would probably be among the very last converts, sitting canker-hearted as water jug after water jug was turned to wine. But I believe in television, and I believe in Netflix’s latest offering to us. Salvation from the outside world for at least 10 hours lies within."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9efe2a5d505a27d8cdef37729d4c22cf64eb3292/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e886a4322365f54db5a7a4cb6a8c7c91","title":"tv shows to get excited about 2020 preview","story":"The Love Islanders are back to lift our winter blues, Phoebe Waller-Bridge returns to the small screen, and there’s evil on the wardsby  Stuart Heritage,  Kate Abbott and  Hannah J Davies(ITV2) The UK’s most talked-about reality show gets a spin-off. The South Africa-set series will feature Iain Stirling’s inimitable acidic commentary, with Laura Whitmore replacing Caroline Flack. If two series a year seems like overkill, it appears the show’s bosses have the answer. Rumour has it they’ve cast more personalities than simply “bronzed and buff”, including “someone related to the royal family” and perhaps the villa’s first goth. 12 January(HBOSky Atlantic) Hugh Laurie plays the captain of a cruise ship in space, given to saying things like “Set phasers to fun”, in Armando Iannucci’s comedy and first show since the gloriously profane Veep. The cast – featuring Zach Woods, Suzy Nakamura, Rebecca Front and Himesh Patel – is extraordinary. The writing will be spectacular. You are going to watch the hell out of this.22 January(HBOSky Comedy) Any show that starts with a deaf 80-year-old man pumping out hardcore porn in a packed retirement lounge is sure to catch your attention. In this sparky comedy, Eve (Kathryn Hahn) is left with a case of empty nest syndrome when her son heads off to college. But instead of lighting scented candles and sinking into blissful baths like her friends, she takes the parental road less travelled of chain-smoking and getting into porn.

But which one is capable of beating Trump?Democrats overwhelmingly agree that their top priority in 2020 is to remove Donald Trump from office. But which of the many Democrats running for president is best suited to the task remains a source of deep anxiety and ision less than five weeks before the Iowa caucuses.After more than a year of campaigning, the Democratic presidential primary enters the final sprint before voting begins on 3 February in Iowa in a familiar but fluid state: Joe Biden in the lead, trailed by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren with Pete Buttigieg also showing signs of strength in the early states.Democrats fear Biden is too old, gaffe-prone and does not excite the activist base. They also worry Sanders and Warren are too far left and will alienate moderates. And they worry Buttigieg is too young and inexperienced.“Suddenly every candidate has clay feet. Voters are worried. There is no perfect candidate but there never is,” said Elaine Karmack, a veteran of Democratic presidential campaigns who studies primaries as a scholar at the Brookings Institution.Fear of another Trump election has turned Democrats into self-professed pundits, determined to suss out the most “electable” candidate. The perception that Biden is best placed to beat Trump, at least among some voters, has strengthened his resilience despite a series of stumbles and controversies. A central thesis of Biden’s campaign – which he increasingly states in blunt terms on the campaign trail – is that he is the candidate most likely to reassemble a Democratic coalition by appealing to white working class voters who Trump won over in 2016 and to black voters who are critical to the Democratic base.But rising in second place is Sanders, who rebounded from a heart attack in October and sinking poll numbers earlier this year. His “comeback” has reinforced – and even expanded – his standing among the party’s left wing after months of watching Warren rise to to the front of the pack.The policy debate and jostling between the party’s many factions has framed much of the contest until this point. Biden and Sanders, the only candidates to have previously run for president, represent the ideological poles of the primary field – and two competing theories of how to beat Trump.Biden argues Trump is an aberration who can be defeated by the election of a president with the goodwill and experience to unite the country and restore the nation’s standing abroad. Sanders believes Trump is a symptom of an American political system and economy warped by money, greed and inequality. In his view, rooting out Trumpism will require not only a Democratic president but sweeping political and economic reforms.The ide over which path to take in 2020 has emerged as a central fault line in the Democratic race.“In this primary we must commit to being aspirational – to really explain what we expect the next president to build not just by refuting what Trump has done but by building a vision for a future that comes after Trump,” said María Urbina, the national political director for progressive group Inisible. “If you’re not excited to vote for somebody, your neighbors and your friends – everyone who we need to turn out this election to beat Trump’s turnout machine – are probably not going to be very excited to vote for them either.”Warren rose steadily last summer to the top of the field with a registry of plans that would fundamentally remake the US economy but she has receded in recent months amid criticism over her health care proposal. Warren and Sanders, ideological allies whose supporters overlap, are now tangled up for second and third place. Progressive groups are taking sides even as the candidates refuse to go after one another out of fear of antagonizing the other’s supporters, which one of them would need to consolidate to win the nomination.Moderates, meanwhile, are hopeful that the two will ide the left and keep each other from capturing the nomination. But after years of losing factional feuds, progressives are emboldened by their political prominence in the race.“The beauty of having more than one progressive candidate in the race is that they have a large, strong base and they have the resources and infrastructure to go all the way into the 2020 calendar year,” said Rebecca Katz, a liberal political consultant. “It’s possible we could be in a situation where they are two of the last candidates standing – and that’s a good thing for the progressive movement.”Even as polling paints a steady picture of the primary race, the contest remains far from settled.Perhaps one of the biggest uncertainties is Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor who entered the race in late November. His strategy for winning the nomination is unorthodox: he won’t contest the early states that every other candidate is scrapping over. Instead, he has poured tens of millions of dollars from his personal fortune into TV and digital advertising into the big, delegate-rich Super Tuesday states going to the polls on 3 March.But there is plenty of time for other surprises before then.One of the most significant developments in the race so far came in November, when Kamala Harris, a US senator from California and the only black woman running for president, abruptly ended her campaign. Her departure sparked a debate among Democrats over how the most erse primary field in political history has stratified into a top-tier of only white and mostly male candidates.No candidate of color has yet qualified for the next debate in January in Iowa, as the first voters prepare to actually cast their ballots. But the Democrats will now have to compete for media attention with the Senate impeachment trial expected in January. For the senators running for president, this will require time off the campaign trail and in Washington to participate as jurors in the trial.Several candidates have staked their campaigns on a strong finish in Iowa, including Buttigieg, Sanders and Amy Klobuchar, the US senator from Minnesota. Biden’s team has signaled that it has low expectations for Iowa. Instead, Biden expects to pull ahead in South Carolina, where he maintains a strong base of support among black voters.﻿On the campaign trail and the debate stage, the candidates will make their closing arguments to voters. After months of debating policy and politics, their final pitches are expected to focus on the issue that matters most to Democrats: why they are the party’s best hope of beating Trump.“Right now, the biggest priority for Democratic voters is who can beat Donald Trump,” said Michael Starr Hopkins, a Democratic strategist who previously worked on John Delaney’s 2020 presidential campaign.“It’s not the whole game but it’s the most important part of it because if you thought what Trump did in his first term was bad, imagine what he is capable of in a second term.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85ea2d700ca650d1b8045ead99d9c539d431be60/0_16_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad934410504ff003288b6d3c61c5ebf1","title":"what are your hopes for the next decade","story":"As the end of the year approaches, we want to hear what you hope the next 10 years will bringAs 2019 draws to a close, we want to find out your hopes, dreams and desires for the next decade.The 2010s have provided the world with an array of defining challenges: from the rise in political populism to the fight against the climate emergency.

That was done in Singapore, and I think he’s a man of his word, so we’re going to find out,” Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. Trump’s secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said he hoped North Korea would choose peace over war. “So, seeing that reporting publicly, it remains the case that we hope that chairman Kim will take a different course,” Pompeo told Fox News in an interview. “We’re hopeful that ... chairman Kim will make the right decision – he’ll choose peace and prosperity over conflict and war.”In an interview with CBS News, Pompeo said Kim should honour commitments he made in meetings with Trump last year. “If chairman Kim has reneged on the commitments he made to president Trump, that is deeply disappointing,” Pompeo said. “He made those commitments to president Trump in exchange for president Trump agreeing not to conduct large-scale military exercises. We’ve lived up to our commitments. We continue to hold out hope that he will live up to his as well.”North Korea has previously fired missiles capable of reaching the entire US mainland and has carried out six nuclear tests.A self-imposed ban has been at the centre of the nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington over the past two years, which has involved three meetings between him and Trump, but little tangible progress.The US had made “gangster-like demands” in the talks process, Kim said, including continuing joint military drills with South Korea, adopting cutting edge weapons and imposing sanctions.“We will reliably put on constant alert the powerful nuclear deterrent capable of containing the nuclear threats from the US and guaranteeing our long-term security.”Analysts said the declaration amounted to Kim putting a missile “to Donald Trump’s head” but that escalation by Pyongyang would probably backfire.Any actual test is likely to infuriate Trump, who has repeatedly referred to Kim‘s “promise” to him not to carry them out, and played down launches of shorter-range weapons.Negotiations between the two sides have been largely deadlocked since the breakup of their Hanoi summit in February.The North Korean leader’s announcement on Wednesday came after the United States missed a year-end deadline for a restart of denuclearisation talks.Kim convened the rare meeting of the ruling party’s policy-making committee on Saturday as the US had not responded to his repeated calls for concessions to reopen negotiations, dismissing the deadline as artificial.“There is no ground for us to get unilaterally bound to the commitment any longer,” the official KCNA news agency cited Kim telling top ruling party officials.“The world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future,” he added, using the acronym for the country’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.The announcement preceded Kim’s annual new year speech, a key moment in the North Korean political calendar, reviewing the past and setting out goals for the future. It will be Kim’s eighth such address after he revived the tradition started by his grandfather – North Korea’s founding leader, Kim Il-sung – but discontinued during his father’s rule.Kim made clear to party officials that the North was willing to live under international sanctions to preserve its nuclear capability.“The US is raising demands contrary to the fundamental interests of our state and is adopting brigandish attitude,” KCNA cited him as saying.Washington had “conducted tens of big and small joint military drills which its president personally promised to stop” and sent high-tech military equipment to the South, he said, and stepped up sanctions against the North.For months, Pyongyang has been demanding the easing of international sanctions imposed over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, while Washington has insisted it takes more tangible steps towards giving them up.“North Korea has, in effect, put an ICBM to Donald Trump’s head in order to gain the two concessions it wants most: sanctions relief and some sort of security guarantee,” said Harry Kazianis of the Center for the National Interest in Washington.“Kim Jong-un is playing a dangerous game of geopolitical chicken,” he added.“He is gambling that threatening another demonstration of his ability to hit the US homeland with a nuclear weapon will somehow push America into granting more concessions.”But the strategy was unlikely to be effective, he said, as Washington was likely to respond with “more sanctions, an increased military presence in East Asia and more fire and fury threats coming from Donald Trump’s Twitter account”.The US has already indicated that it will react if the North carried out a long-range missile test.An ICBM launch would also be likely to frustrate China, the North’s key diplomatic backer and provider of trade and aid, which always stresses stability in a region it regards as its backyard.But ties between Pyongyang and Beijing have warmed markedly in the past two years, with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, paying his first visit to the North as head of state in June, and Beijing and Washington at loggerheads over trade and other issues.In December China and Russia – another key economic partner for the North – proposed loosening UN sanctions against Pyongyang, and analysts said Kim is likely to seek to exploit rivalries between Washington, Beijing and Moscow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b98cde82acb0ff007ce5eeea08a9650a0216d8e/1005_197_1743_1046/master/1743.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1d4c14b2dc1a24ac83b3bd9935d1fb0","title":"british teenagers mother calls for tourism boycott of cyprus","story":"Mother of woman found guilty of lying about being gang-raped says Ayia Napa resort is unsafeThe mother of a British teenager found guilty of lying about being gang-raped in Cyprus has backed calls for a tourism boycott of the country.The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that she supported the campaign and that she believed the resort town of Ayia Napa was unsafe.“The place isn’t safe, it is absolutely not safe. And if you go and report something that’s happened to you, you’re either laughed at, as far as I can tell, or, in the worst case, something like what’s happened to my daughter may happen,” she said.The teenager said she was raped by up to 12 Israeli tourists in a hotel room in Ayia Napa on 17 July, but she was charged and a dozen young men aged between 15 and 20 who were arrested over the incident were freed after she signed a retraction statement 10 days later.The woman said her daughter was experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), hallucinations, and sleeping for up to 20 hours a day because of a condition called hypersomnia.“She needs to get back to the UK to get that treated. That’s my absolute primary focus. She can’t be treated here because hearing foreign men speaking loudly will trigger an episode. It needs resolving otherwise she’s going to carry on having this for the rest of her life,” the woman said.She said her daughter had planned to go to university this year after being accepted for the courses she applied for and being offered a bursary at one institute.“So, no question, she would have gone to university, but it was in a career that she wouldn’t be able to do with this ‘public mischief’ verdict. So, again, life-changing for her. She needs to totally rethink her options.”A crowdfunding appeal to raise money for legal support for her daughter has passed £80,000. The “help teen victim get justice in Cyprus” GoFundMe page was set up in August by the British lawyer John Hobbs to raise cash for the 19-year-old’s legal representation.The teenager claimed in court she was raped but forced to change her account under pressure from Cypriot police.The Foreign Office said the UK was seriously concerned about the fairness of the woman’s trial and it is understood officials have raised the “deeply distressing case” with the Cypriot authorities.Lawyers and campaigners criticised the justice system after the woman was convicted of public mischief at Famagusta district court in Paralimni on Monday.The psychologist who assessed the woman as part of her defence case, Dr Christine Tizzard, said she was concerned the trial had not fully considered that she had been diagnosed with PTSD.She told the : “The salient point is that she was diagnosed with PTSD. That’s a standalone diagnosis. It’s a valid diagnosis and it hasn’t really been fully represented.“Aside the fact it hasn’t been fully represented, it means she’s been unable to get the treatment she so sorely needs and every day she’s not having treatment the worse it gets.”The government of Cyprus has said it has “full confidence in the justice system and the courts”.Cyprus’s attorney general said on Tuesday he could not suspend the trial because the woman had levelled “grave accusations” against police investigators that had to be adjudicated in court.He said her allegation that police coerced her into retracting her rape claim “could not have been left to linger” so he could not move to suspend the trial.In a statement, Costas Clerides added: “Any intervention on the part of the attorney general, either for reasons of public interest or any other reasons, would have constituted nothing more than an obstacle to ascertaining the true facts of the case, as well as interference in the judiciary’s work.”Judge Michalis Papathanasiou said he believed the woman had made false allegations because she felt “embarrassed” after realising she had been filmed having sex in a video found on some of the Israelis’ mobile phones.The woman has been on bail since the end of August, after spending a month in prison, and could face up to a year in jail and a €1,700 (£1,500) fine when she is sentenced on 7 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5df3f91d11cc92fd02293bd51fa76647e50a8af/0_14_2900_1740/master/2900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8690f5e1b91f2d486e84e02a92dee90b","title":"huge rise in number of people trying to cross channel to uk by sea","story":"French officials say more than 2,300 people wer picked up last year, up from 586 in 2018The number of people making desperate attempts to cross the Channel by sea from France has quadrupled over the last year.French officials say almost 2,358 people were picked up in the Channel attempting to reach the UK by boat or swimming in 2019, compared with 586 in 2018.In total in 2019 there were 261 crossings or attempted sea crossings, mostly by small, overloaded inflatable craft, leading to four deaths. Fifty-five percent of the attempts were unsuccessful. The most desperate attempted to swim the Channel, which is 20.7 miles across at its narrowest point.On Tuesday more than 40 migrants, including eight children, were intercepted in the Channel by the Border Force.

The migrants were taken to Calais.In the last year, the number of attempted crossings has soared despite repeated warnings from the French authorities and migrant support organisations of the danger in the Channel, one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, from traffic, strong currents and icy water.After meeting the British home secretary, Priti Patel, in August, the French interior minister, Christophe Castaner, said it was in both countries’ interests to stop “irregular crossings” of the Channel.The Home Office said patrols on French beaches had doubled and drones, specialist vehicles and detection equipment had been deployed to deter crossings. It said it had sent back 125 illegal migrants who had arrived by sea in 2019 to show its “determination” to return those entering the country illegally to Europe where they should seek asylum.Natalie Elphicke, the Conservative MP for Dover, said France needed to do more to stop boats setting off from its coast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8196de9c6520866a93080241c2f04837e2cdfe79/0_33_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cd49565185578b8c55221fccbe67417","title":"western balkans left betrayed by eu over membership talks albania north macedonia croatia","story":"Croatia questions decision not to begin formal dialogue with Albania and North Macedonia The European Union’s refusal to open membership talks with North Macedonia and Albania has left feelings of betrayal in the western Balkans, Croatia, which takes over the bloc’s rotating presidency on 1 January, has said.Gordan Grlić Radman, the foreign minister of Croatia, which in 2013 became the last country to join the European Union, questioned whether the decision of EU leaders at a summit in October, led by France and backed by Denmark and the Netherlands, was correct and fair.The country, which is taking the EU presidency for the first time, is seeking to revive the EU dream for North Macedonia and Albania.North Macedonia had hoped to get approval to open membership talks after ending a 30-year dispute with Greece over its name. Albania, which filed an application to join the EU in 2009, had also hoped to start formal negotiations. Membership talks between these countries and the EU will take years.Both countries were told they had a future in the EU in 2003, but years of crisis and internal ision inside the bloc, as well as the weakening rule of law in some member states, have dampened appetite for more members.Radman said North Macedonia had met all the preconditions. “Now is it correct and fair? They made a lot of efforts,” he said referring to the historic deal to change the country’s name, made with the assumption that EU and Nato membership would follow. “The people in North Macedonia were not happy with this change of name … And now the cold shower. They lost from all sides, they feel betrayed.”North Macedonia’s foreign minister, Nikola Dimitrov, said the deal “was a small miracle in this part of Europe and needs nurturing”. He said the Croatian presidency could be a good chance for the discussion to get back on track.Croatia hopes EU leaders can reach agreement on reforming its enlargement process in March, prior to a summit between the EU and six western Balkan countries in May.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, insists the EU enlargement process should be overhauled to include a provision that countries can be required to redo earlier stages if there is any backsliding on commitments to the rule of law. Radman said Croatia would be an honest broker, but also questioned whether it was fair to change the rules for countries that had begun talks under the existing system, such as Serbia and Montenegro. “It is not possible to change the rules during the play,” he said.“The opening of accession agreements doesn’t cost the European Union,” contended Radman, an argument dismissed by Macron. “Just to open negotiations: of course it does not mean they will become members tomorrow.”Leaders of the EU institutions declared the decision of the leaders’ summit not to open accession talks as a “historic mistake”.Critics of Macron’s approach have pointed to the growing influence of China, Turkey and Russia in the western Balkans and say that by stepping aside, the EU will allow other players to move in.“A serious debate has now started, but the mood in the region is very depressed. There’s a general worry about whether enlargement is going to continue, or whether there will there be further obstacles at every step,” said Florian Bieber, a political scientist at the University of Graz.Ruslan Stefanov, a director at the Center for the Study of Democracy in Sofia, said Macron had a point, that the EU needed to treat enlargement as a political, foreign policy challenge, not a technical process. “There is a strong political angle to this accession process and this requires a much more assertive foreign policy on the side of the EU.” This meant, he said, that EU delegations in western Balkan candidate countries should be vocal “on a daily basis” if a government is failing to live up to its promises. “If something happens that is not in line with what should be happening then we should say. We should not wait to say this in six months time in a report … We should say on the news locally.”He said neither North Macedonia nor Albania could count on getting approval in the first part of the year, citing the troubled Franco-German relationship. Germany remains a strong advocate for EU enlargement in the Balkans, but was not able to convince France. “I haven’t seen the chemistry between Berlin and Paris on this after the so-called historic mistake,” Stefanov said. “I haven’t seen the stars aligning, I haven’t seen much practical work.”Bieber said Croatia was a supporter of accession for Albania and North Macedonia, but cautioned that the country “has its own agenda when it comes to Bosnia and its own tensions with Serbia, so in that regard it’s got issues with its neighbours that don’t make it easy to promote enlargement”.Croatia will have support in its pro-enlargement agenda from Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s far-right prime minister. Hungary’s Olivér Várhelyi is in charge of the enlargement portfolio in the new EU commission, and Orbán has long been an advocate of enlargement, favouring the EU admitting countries without making demands on democracy and rule of law.“It’s very important that in the upcoming period those of us who want enlargement give these countries our support,” said Orbán, in a recent interview with Croatian media. “Croatians and Hungarians agree that the European Union should admit as many countries as possible as rapidly as possible, according to uniform standards. This would not only benefit them, but also Croatia, Hungary and European security in general.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Woman had tugged pontiff\u0026rsquos arm during a walkabout in St Peters Square in VaticanBail granted before Christmas but issues with raising cash delayed releaseGirl weighing 3.23kgs born at 12 minutes past midnight, mother and baby doing wellDublin Castle service to remember those killed in War of IndependenceCity\u0026rsquos Lord Mayor says events of 1920 will be marked with a year-long programmeGovernment advisory body recommends consideration for a permanent memorialWoman kissed on neck against her will, pinched and pinned against fridge by male colleagueProject Servator uses non-uniformed officers who watch people\u0026rsquos behavior when they see policeArtefacts include shoes reputedly owned by Libyan dictator Colonel Muammar GadafyMajor incidents such as terrorist attacks, protests and missing people prompt callsFifty-four people died on North\u0026rsquos roads in 2019, according to provisional figuresFear of immigrants can be exploited in terms that support narrow populism, says archbishopMasked raiders threatened staff at store in Ovens with a meat cleaver during robberyDriver of other car and two teenage passengers taken to hospital for treatmentMinister calls on road users to take \u0026lsquogreater responsibility for actions when using roads\u0026rsquoTracks closed in both directions at Dunmurry as PSNI officers examine the areaAlleged Islamic State member said to be anxious to be reunited with daughter aged 2WRC finds Veronica Battles failed to establish discrimination against Kilgarvan MaceHSE says there is \u0026lsquopractical time lag\u0026rsquo between patient being fit for discharge and leaving"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4128155.1577877235!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"over 1 700 irish citizens required dfa assistance overseas in 2019","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSt Sebastian’s Church in Negombo, Sri Lanka, after multiple explosions targeting churches and hotels killed 259 people in April 2019. Photograph: Getty Images.The Department of Foreign Affairs assisted 1,723 Irish citizens caught up in major incidents overseas last year.These incidents included terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka and Kenya, protests in Hong Kong and political instability in South America. Medical emergencies were the most common cause of contact, with 270 people requiring assistance for that.Over 260 families required the support of the Department following the death of a loved one abroad, while 243 people needed help with overseas arrests.Some 112 people were victims of crime in another country, while72 families required help tracing a missing person.The Department assisted these people through its consular office in Dublin, in its 80 embassies and consulates-general, and in the 94 honorary consuls around the world.One of the most notable cases in which the Department provided assistance was that of teenager Nora Quoirin, whose body was found in a Malaysian rainforest after a 10-day search. In April 2019 a series of terrorist attacks on churches and luxury hotels in Sri Lanka left 259 people dead, many of them tourists. The Department of Foreign Affairs advised people to stay indoors and obey the curfew that was in place at the time, saying they could contact the Honorary Consul in Colombo for assistance if needed.Commenting on the figures, Minister Simon Coveney said:“Irish citizens continue to travel more often and more widely than ever before - meaning a greater frequency and complexity of consular cases. This presents ever-growing challenges in providing assistance for Irish citizens who get into difficulty overseas.“While most journeys overseas go smoothly, the 2019 statistics show that things can and do go wrong and that it is important to be prepared.

File photograph: Alan BetsonFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has described as “false promises” a pledge by Fine Gael to abolish the Universal Social Charge in the run-up to the 2016 general election. Mr Martin claimed Fine Gael always knew that abolishing the charge was not going to happen because the money was not there to achieve that. He said that Fianna Fáil, if elected to office, would not abolish USC – despite polls consistently showing it is unpopular with voters.“I have said to people on the doorstep it will not be abolished over the next five years either.”Major expenditureHe said that sorting out issues of housing and health as well as bringing in measures to tackle climate change would involve major expenditure by the State. USC is a tax payable on a person’s total income, without many of the exemptions available in income tax. It is less than 2 per cent for the first €20,000 of income is charged at 4. 5 per cent for the next €50,000, up to €70,000 and is 8 per cent for the balance of income above €70,000. One of the commitments in the Fine Gael manifesto in 2016 was to abolish the charge. Speaking during an end-of-year interview, Mr Martin criticised the commitment as baseless. “I think they’re very false promises made in the last election by Leo Varadkar and by Fine Gael – that they would abolish USC. That was never going to happen because the money was never there to do that.”He compared the pledge to the promises made in the recent British general election. “What stunned me with the British election was, both parties promised billions and billions.\u0026nbsp“I think we’re hopefully going away from that in Ireland,” he said.

We all know the fatalistic logic: the real power lies with the governments of countries such as China, or with the banks that fund the oil industry. What can you or I really achieve with our reusable coffee cups and vegan sausage rolls, other than occupying a rather smug patch of moral high ground, or worse still, creating a comforting illusion that masks the real problem?But there is another point of view. If we take the climate crisis seriously, how can we not want to try, even in some small way, to be part of the solution? Can we really expect the countries and companies that produce the most carbon to change if we don’t show willing to make some small sacrifice in our own lives? And if we all do something, won’t governments and corporations be encouraged to reflect the wishes of the people, even if they are motivated just by winning our votes and taking our money?I’ve sensed this urge to do something while speaking to colleagues recently. And it’s the desire to contribute that has prompted us to create this series of blogs, under the banner “20 Pledges for 2020”. It started on the Lifestyle desk. Did I know, asked one of our staff, that our deputy travel editor was going flight-free for a year? For someone who must receive more invitations for all-expenses-paid trips to the sun than anyone I can name, this was no casual commitment. Then I heard there was a colleague who’s going vegan, and another determined to switch to an electric car. And so the list went on.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe’re not immune to the bigger challenges and responsibilities of the media. During our recent coverage of the UK general election, we set out to make climate the most important theme for our coverage. Looking back, we led our site and our Daily Edition app on climate issues more than any other major British publisher over the same period – no small achievement – but I can’t say we managed to make it our number-one subject it was perhaps inevitable that the NHS and Brexit dominated the political agenda even on our pages. So one of the blogs you’ll see starting over the next few weeks will be from our politics team, pledging to hold politicians to account over the climate.As for me, I’ll be blogging about how The Independent can use its reach and influence to help fight the climate crisis. This was a challenge set for me directly by our environment columnist Donnachadh McCarthy, who is also part of the media team of Extinction Rebellion. I had always been confident that The Independent was not part of the problem. I’m proud to have worked here at the time when Michael McCarthy, our former environment editor, and the late Steve Connor, our science editor, helped to blaze a trail with their reporting and analysis. The natural world was not always such a fashionable cause back then, but you knew they were on to something from the level of pushback we received – even if sometimes it was impossible not to chuckle along.Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

It’s not like we’re The Independent, we can’t just stick a headline saying ‘Cruelty’ and then stick a picture of a dolphin or a whale underneath it. I mean, that’s just cheating, that’s rubbish.” (With apologies to real fans, I’ve filtered out the fruitier adjectives.) It’s amazing to think how recently such large parts of the media were sceptical towards “climate zealots”, and still are.But Donnachadh put a challenge to me a few months ago: when you look at the Indy, is it really clear that we’re living through a crisis? Couldn’t we be doing more? He was right, of course, and we will do more, so I’ll be blogging to keep you up to date with the changes we’re making.There are three phases to climate journalism as far as I can see. First, journalists had a job to do to convince sceptics that the science is right: mankind’s use of fossil fuels is heating our planet. Then there was the second phase: how fast was the world warming, can we limit the rise to 1.5 degrees, 3 degrees, or more? That’s still a crucial debate, and a subject we will continue to track. But the 20 Pledges blogs belong to a third phase: what exactly are we going to do about it – from government policy, financial regulation and international treaties to our own compromises and choices?Before someone helpfully points out the obvious, I realise that none of us writing these blogs is perfect. I’ll start by holding my hand up: for one thing, I fly from our London office to see our US-based staff, just as our reporters often take flights to report on stories around the world, so I’ll be writing more about that in a future blog post.But this project is not about pretending to be perfect, or virtue-signalling, or being diabolically hypocritical, and we certainly aren’t setting out to preach (there’s enough climate puritanism online already). If, or when, we slip up along the way – when the trip to review a new hotel is too tempting, if the smell of a bacon sandwich catches us at a moment of weakness – we’ll write about those times too. So what are we hoping for? We hope it gives us a richer perspective on some of the more important climate stories we cover in 2020, and that by sharing our own experiences we might encourage others to share theirs too. We’ll try to use our voice to encourage change from governments too.You may want to make a pledge yourself and write a blog through the year about it with us, in which case please do get in touch. You can email all of us writing these blogs at 20pledges@, and you’ll find all the blogs, running through the year, appearing at www.news20-pledges.Your pledge may not exactly change the world by itself, but if you share your story, you never know whose mind you might change along the way.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I can now finally communicate freely with the media, and look forward to starting next week.”Neither Mr Ghosn’s lawyer nor a spokesperson for the Tokyo prosecutor’s office had any comment when contacted about his whereabouts.A Nissan spokesperson declined to comment.According to state media, Lebanon\u0027s General Security Directorate intelligence agency said Mr Ghosn entered the country legally and no legal measures would be taken against him.Lebanon does not have an extradition treaty with Japan, according to Japan’s justice ministry, making it unlikely that he could be forced to return to Tokyo to face trial.It was unclear how Mr Ghosn, who holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese citizenship, was able to leave Japan, where his movement and communications had been monitored to prevent him fleeing the country of tampering with evidence. His lawyer in Japanese said he retained possession of all three of Mr Ghosn\u0027s passports.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One unidentified person told the newspaper Mr Ghosn did not believe he would get a fair trial in Japan and was “tired of being an industrial political hostage”.He is reportedly set to hold a press conference in the coming days.A Nissan source told Reuters: “I think he gave up fighting the prosecutors in court. It’s outrageous”.Mr Ghosn was arrested on 19 November, 2018, shortly after his private jet landed in Tokyo. He faces four charges – which he denies – including concealing income and enriching himself through payments to dealerships in the Middle East.Nissan sacked him as chairman after internal investigations found misconduct ranging from understating his salary while he was its chief executive, and transferring $5m (£3.8m) of company funds to an account in which he had an interest.Mr Ghosn has claimed he is the victim of a boardroom coup, accusing former Nissan colleagues of “backstabbing” and describing them as selfish rivals bent on derailing a closer alliance between the Japanese carmaker and its top shareholder Renault, of which he was also chairman.His lawyers have asked the court to dismiss all charges, accusing prosecutors of colluding with government officials and Nissan executives to oust him to block any takeover of the by Renault.The case has brought scrutiny of Japan’s criminal justice system, which allows suspects to be detained for long periods and prohibits defence lawyers from being present during interrogations that can last eight hours a day.Mr Ghosn was released from prison in March on a $9m (£6.9m) bail, among the highest ever paid in Japan, after the court rejected an appeal by prosecutors to keep him behind bars. He had since been under house arrest.France’s junior economy minister Agnes\u0026nbspPannier-Runacher\u0026nbspsaid she was “very surprised” by news of Mr\u0026nbspGhosn’s\u0026nbsparrival in Lebanon, adding she had heard of it through the media.She told broadcaster\u0026nbspBFM-TV\u0026nbsphe was “not above the laws” but was entitled to consular support from France.Brazilian-born, of Lebanese descent and a French citizen, Mr Ghosn began his career in 1978 at tyre maker Michelin. In 1996, he moved to Renault where he oversaw a turnaround at the carmaker that won him the nickname “Le Cost Killer”.After Renault sealed an alliance with Nissan in 1999, he used similar methods to revive the ailing brand, leading to business superstar status in Japan, blanket media coverage and even a manga comic book on his life.In a 2011 nationwide poll about who the Japanese would like to run their country, Mr Ghosn finished seventh – two places ahead of Barack Obama. In another survey, he was named the man Japanese women most wanted to marry.​Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I can now finally communicate freely with the media, and look forward to starting next week.”Neither Mr Ghosn’s lawyer nor a spokesperson for the Tokyo prosecutor’s office had any comment when contacted about his whereabouts.A Nissan spokesperson declined to comment.According to state media, Lebanon\u0027s General Security Directorate intelligence agency said Mr Ghosn entered the country legally and no legal measures would be taken against him.Lebanon does not have an extradition treaty with Japan, according to Japan’s justice ministry, making it unlikely that he could be forced to return to Tokyo to face trial.It was unclear how Mr Ghosn, who holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese citizenship, was able to leave Japan, where his movement and communications had been monitored to prevent him fleeing the country of tampering with evidence. His lawyer in Japanese said he retained possession of all three of Mr Ghosn\u0027s passports.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One unidentified person told the newspaper Mr Ghosn did not believe he would get a fair trial in Japan and was “tired of being an industrial political hostage”.He is reportedly set to hold a press conference in the coming days.A Nissan source told Reuters: “I think he gave up fighting the prosecutors in court. It’s outrageous”.Mr Ghosn was arrested on 19 November, 2018, shortly after his private jet landed in Tokyo. He faces four charges – which he denies – including concealing income and enriching himself through payments to dealerships in the Middle East.Nissan sacked him as chairman after internal investigations found misconduct ranging from understating his salary while he was its chief executive, and transferring $5m (£3.8m) of company funds to an account in which he had an interest.Mr Ghosn has claimed he is the victim of a boardroom coup, accusing former Nissan colleagues of “backstabbing” and describing them as selfish rivals bent on derailing a closer alliance between the Japanese carmaker and its top shareholder Renault, of which he was also chairman.His lawyers have asked the court to dismiss all charges, accusing prosecutors of colluding with government officials and Nissan executives to oust him to block any takeover of the by Renault.The case has brought scrutiny of Japan’s criminal justice system, which allows suspects to be detained for long periods and prohibits defence lawyers from being present during interrogations that can last eight hours a day.Mr Ghosn was released from prison in March on a $9m (£6.9m) bail, among the highest ever paid in Japan, after the court rejected an appeal by prosecutors to keep him behind bars. He had since been under house arrest.France’s junior economy minister Agnes\u0026nbspPannier-Runacher\u0026nbspsaid she was “very surprised” by news of Mr\u0026nbspGhosn’s\u0026nbsparrival in Lebanon, adding she had heard of it through the media.She told broadcaster\u0026nbspBFM-TV\u0026nbsphe was “not above the laws” but was entitled to consular support from France.Brazilian-born, of Lebanese descent and a French citizen, Mr Ghosn began his career in 1978 at tyre maker Michelin. In 1996, he moved to Renault where he oversaw a turnaround at the carmaker that won him the nickname “Le Cost Killer”.After Renault sealed an alliance with Nissan in 1999, he used similar methods to revive the ailing brand, leading to business superstar status in Japan, blanket media coverage and even a manga comic book on his life.In a 2011 nationwide poll about who the Japanese would like to run their country, Mr Ghosn finished seventh – two places ahead of Barack Obama. In another survey, he was named the man Japanese women most wanted to marry.​Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22.

Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.Doctor Strange\u0026nbspcame out in 2016 and\u0026nbspCumberbatch’s\u0026nbspsorcerer has appeared in other Marvel films, including the Avengers series.\u0026nbspDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, the second standalone film dedicated to his character, is expected for 2021.That film will be part of Marvel’s Phase Four, which comes after the Infinity Saga that wrapped up with\u0026nbspAvengers: Endgame\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspSpider-Man: Far From Home.In the same Q\u0026ampA, Feige discussed Marvel’s decision to cast Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man, who ended up becoming one of the most iconic characters in the Avengers franchise.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There is an attainment gap for poorer pupils inevitably, therefore, few pass the 11-plus test. It seems very wrong to spend millions expanding schools most likely to offer places to middle-class kids.\u0026nbsp“It’s clear that the government’s attempt to widen access to grammar schools has failed. With the current crisis in school funding, it is wholly misguided and unfair to reward schools which work for only a tiny percentage of pupils.”\u0026nbspGovernment gives £50m to 16 grammar schools for 4,000 pupilsBut the schools that saw a fall in the number of poorer children sitting the 11-plus this year suggested the figures could be higher as some parents do not disclose pupil premium status on registration.\u0026nbspMark Fenton, chief executive of the Grammar School Heads Association, has argued it is “too early” to judge whether the selective schools’ proposals for widening access have worked.\u0026nbspHe added that only a small percentage of children eligible for pupil premium currently achieve top results in Sats exams at primary school so grammar schools are “targeting a very small group”.Mr Fenton said: “This is a real challenge which will take years of patient effort. Work has only just started since the 16 successful schools only had their bids approved midway through the last school year.\u0026nbsp“Though an important aspiration, boosting the numbers taking the test is only one part of the equation. The changes schools have made to their admissions policies will, given time, have a greater impact.”Proportion of poorer children falls in grammars sharing £50m in fundsGrammar schools to prioritise poor local children despite hostility Thousands protest against grammar school plans to boost poorer pupilsThe number of poorer children given places at grammar schools for September 2020 will only become apparent after March when thousands of pupils find out their allocated school.\u0026nbspLast year, figures revealed that the proportion of poorer children admitted to the group of grammar schools due to share the £50m fund fell despite pressure from ministers.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “It is incredibly hard to leverage greater social mobility through selective education because the reality is that middle-class parents have the resources to pay for supplementary private tuition to prepare their children for entrance tests while poorer families cannot afford to do so.”He added: “Expanding selective education simply is not the answer – however that expansion takes place – and the priority needs to be in providing more investment in high-quality comprehensive education which gives all young people the best start in life regardless of their circumstances.”A DfE spokesperson said: “We do not recognise this data. We are seeing an increase in the numbers of pupil premium admissions to selective schools in many that we talk to.“Selective schools can only receive expansion funding if they clearly set out how they will increase access for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.“We are collecting information from schools to monitor the progress of their plans and we will also monitor the number of pupil premium children joining the schools.’’Department for Education\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The bird, floating on the seawater beneath a cliff, held a stick in its beak.It began to scratch its back with the stick – the puffin, as Ms Fayet watched, was using a tool.Ms Fayet, a puffin expert who studies how the birds migrate and feed, wrote about the crafty bird in her notebook. But she had no photo evidence of this first-of-a-kind sighting. “It was just one observation, and I was busy doing something else,” she said. As unusual as this was, Ms Fayet said, she “kind of forgot about it”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUntil it happened again. In July 2018, Ms Fayet was studying another group of puffins at Grimsey Island in Iceland, about a thousand miles from Wales. She planted camera traps on the island and recorded “loads and loads of puffin behaviour”.Another puffin used a scratching stick. This time, the action unfolded in front of a camera: The bird spots a stick and grasps it with a cartoon-bright beak. The bird makes a burbling sound. It turns, as if to face the lens. And then it scratches its chest feathers with the stick’s pointy end.Created with Sketch.Science news in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 Over 400 species discovered this year by Natural History MuseumThe ancient invertabrate worm-like species rhenopyrgus viviani (pictured) is one of over 400 species previously unknown to science that were discovered by experts at the Natural History Museum this year220 Jackdaws can identify \u0027dangerous\u0027 humansJackdaws can identify “dangerous” humans from listening to each other’s warning calls, scientists say. 320 Turtle embryos influence sex by shakingThe sex of the turtle is determined by the temperatures at which they are incubated.

This was not some nesting behaviour gone awry. Puffins collect soft grass for their nests, then hurry into their burrows with beaks full of bedding. The puffin in Iceland dropped the stick after it finished scratching. Hours later, the camera recorded the stick, still discarded, on the ground.This behaviour “fits all current definitions” of tool use, said University of Oxford zoologist Alex Kacelnik, who has studied toolmaking crows and was not a member of the puffin research team.Outrage over trophy hunts to Iceland to kill puffinsMs Fayet sent the recording to her colleague Dora Biro, an animal behaviour expert at the University of Oxford. The video immediately excited Ms Biro because, as she said, “this was a puffin, this was a seabird – and tool use had never been reported in seabirds before”. Together, with their colleague Erpur Snaer Hansen, the biologists described puffin tools in a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Studying animal tools can help scientists understand the origins of our own Stone Age, which began when our ancestors picked up rocks around 2.6 million years ago. But tools wielded by beak, paw or snout are rare. Scientists have observed tool use in fewer than 1 per cent of species, which are erratically scattered among animal groups. Chimpanzees and several other primate species use tools. Yet so do sea otters, fish and even some insects, such as ants that sop up honey in spongy matter.Several bird species use tools. Crows in the Pacific, for instance, use hooked twigs to catch grubs. But back-scratching is an unusual form of tool use that the scientists called “body care”. The only other type of body care observed in wild birds, Ms Biro said, is “anting”, in which birds cover their bodies in insects. Bug juices, biologists suspect, can act as chemical defences against bird parasites or fungi.The puffin in Iceland may have been trying to rid itself of ticks. “At the time, when these observations were made, there was also a particularly high parasite load on the birds that year,” Ms Biro said.

After all, why use a stick when a beak could do? He wondered whether the irritants on the puffins could be “toxic or particularly distasteful” – like a smear of boat fuel, perhaps – “hence the birds may have wanted to avoid beak contact”. In experiments, New Caledonian crows, the grub-fishing species, will use sticks to touch objects the birds perceive as dangerous, such as rubber spiders, he said.Or, maybe, the satisfaction of an itch well-scratched is just one of those things that transcends species.University of Oxford\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Brexit doesn’t make a difference, but we do know that the criminals are using this to try to drive more business.”A “joint action plan” signed in January 2019 saw the UK pay £6m for increased security along the French coast, which has resulted in many more migrants intercepted by French authorities and turned back.Migrant boat arrivals to UK increase six-fold in 2019 Woman ‘thrown in jail’ while delivering gifts to migrant campsChild among 49 migrants rescued from boats crossing English Channel Pope warns migrants fleeing injustice met with ‘walls of indifference\u0027But the number getting through has rocketed, and just 125 people who arrived in the UK by boat in the past year have been returned to the European mainland.“This is becoming a very much a business-as-usual route,” said Ms Moreton.“When this increased massively this time last year, we had the Home Secretary declaring a state of emergency. Now this is something that we just expect.“The numbers have increased massively in the last couple of weeks. We do normally see an increase in clandestine migration over Christmas – that’s been a pattern for decades.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailThe perception that the sea crossing is an easier way into the UK has driven up the number of attempts, and led to some migrants making their own efforts to cross the Channel without the assistance of smugglers, said Ms Moreton.“It’s one of the more successful routes across,” she said. “The number of efforts that you have to make to cross are smaller than trying to conceal yourself in a lorry or the back of a vehicle. But it is also much much more risky.“Until very recently, it’s been the purview of organised crime, these are things that people pay a lot of money to be put onto.“But as it becomes more and more successful it’s more reported in the media, we’re now starting to see people that we think are trying to do this on their own. There’s the gentleman in flippers, two in a kayak, that type of thing. “Border Force boats deployed in the Channel were there primarily to prevent loss of life, and did not necessarily deter would-be migrants, said Ms Moreton.“Once the vessels are in the water. It’s quite common for the migrants on it to threaten their own lives if they’re approached particularly by a French vessel,” she said. “If they’re approached by a British vessel they’re quite happy.“Their aim is to get to the UK and the Border Force vessels aren’t there to deter them from setting sail, they are there to ensure that they reach the other side alive.“There are arguments around that, but at sea the general rule is that life is paramount.”Ms Moreton said that those arriving by small boat have generally been coached in the stories they should provide to enhance their chances of successfully claiming asylum.But almost half of those intercepted already have asylum claims in other EU countries, which can be traced by fingerprints.While there have been prosecutions for people smuggling in the French courts, they had so far not been enough to prevent the trade, she said.A Border Force boat arrives in Dover (PA)The joint action plan agreed with France in January 2019 included more than £6m of British investment in security equipment, CCTV and surveillance on the French coast.The Home Office said an “enhanced action plan” announced in October aimed to make “attempts to cross the Channel in small boats an infrequent phenomenon by spring 2020”.It pledged that British and French authorities would increase intelligence-sharing on smuggling gangs, and engage “directly with migrants, to change their behaviour and deter them from making the journey to the UK”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade. They have sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world listening with me to every word of every story. I feel torn staring at them, joy at returning to my loved ones and the heartache of those I had to leave behind. Now they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up and lined up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away.….”David, 13, arrived in Uganda in July 2016 fleeing the civil war that broke out in South Sudan. He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums.

I am staring at my canvas camera bags, which sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world.\u0026nbspNow they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away…Here I have compiled a collection of photographs and memories, comprising the stories of some of the most marginalised children in the world.Winter: Abdul, a Syrian refugee aged 10, is seated in a makeshift shelter, perched high among\u0026nbspthe rugged snowy mountain caps of Arsal, Lebanon. He holds his father’s hand as they both huddle\u0026nbspby the stove for warmth. He has the haunting stare of a boy who knows he is\u0026nbspgoing to die, an expression that cuts through the paraffin haze of the dark room as temperatures fall below zero. Mohammed, his father, gaunt from grief, explains\u0026nbsphis son is two years overdue for an operation that could save his life.\u0026nbspWith no means to finance it, he raises\u0026nbsphis hands to the sky in hope that his prayers would be answered.\u0026nbspI remember waiting to see my doctor as a child. I knew my turn would come Abdul knew his would not.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSpring:\u0026nbspVenezuelan refugees who once ate together as families around their own tables\u0026nbspnow eat from rubbish bins on their hands and knees to survive the crisis in their country. All the while, their president publicly feasts\u0026nbspin lavish establishments. Roughly 3.5 million Venezuelans, among them doctors, lawyers and teachers, have left their country, out of starvation and fear.Joender, aged six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela, arrived in\u0026nbspIpiales, Colombia, exhausted and hungry. He was offloaded with his family from a galvanised lorry like cattle, after a 33-day journey, mostly on foot, where they were forced to beg for food to survive. His cupped hands are\u0026nbsprewarded with a packet of biscuits donated by a local in the town. He clutches\u0026nbspthe packet like a prize. Having never begged for food myself as a child, I could not begin to understand the internal dialogue in doing so. I knew I could simply open a fridge door\u0026nbspJoender\u0026nbspcan’t.Summer:\u0026nbspEsperence, aged 10, is a Haitian “restavek” or child slave. He was\u0026nbspgiven away by his biological parents to a more affluent household and\u0026nbspforced into a life of domestic servitude. The feeling of being abandoned proves\u0026nbspto be too much for him. Standing in the kitchen and washing dishes, he simply shrugs his small shoulders, and one by one the tears roll\u0026nbspdown his face. Hours each day are spent cleaning, sweeping and washing.\u0026nbsp“I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs,”\u0026nbsphe says.\u0026nbspNearly 260 million children aren’t in school – do we care?

In a dark room in remote north western Tanzania, she explains\u0026nbsphow not going to school saddens\u0026nbspher. But she nonetheless still dreams that somehow she could become a teacher to help others like her with no access to education. I didn\u0027t have a choice.\u0026nbspI had to go to school. Mamoke didn’t have a choice, but that was because the right of education was unavailable to her. I realise I have taken so much\u0026nbspfor granted in my life. Children around the world live with no access to healthcare, displaced from their home, going to sleep hungry, growing up in conflict and with no\u0026nbspeducation.I did not choose my career any more than I chose my life.

When he is at home he just loves to snooze on his bed.He is what we call mph couch potatoes. He does have a medical condition where he cannot go in the heat. There is no medical treatment with that and he has a specic cool coat he wears in the summer.Car ridesA good snooze in his bedNeeds:Quiet environment lose to the Dogs TrustA reliable routineA home without children or other dogsTo find out more about Stevie you go here.Stevie is seven years old with little grey hairs sprouting around this snout.Louise says Stevie does get asked about but she believes that because he has been them for so long it raises questions, despite the Dogs Trust being able to successfully re-home nearly  greyhounds in the time hes been in their care.She said: In theory he shouldnt be a dficult dog to re-home but since he has been with us for so long it raises a few suspicions.He would need someone who has had lurcher and greyhounds before because they tend to be loyal as in once they have one they tend to stick to that breed.Stevie loves gnawing on a good bone when it comes to celebrating Christmas and his birthday.However Stevie isnt the Shrewsbury shelters only pooch who has been unlucky in love.A gentle giant named Lilly has been a resident at the Dogs Trust since June .The Rottweiler was dumped at the shelter after the family she came from suffered a breakdown in marriage, leaving her anxious about trusting new people.Louise said Lilly requires a similar home to Stevie but it could take weeks of introductions and further behavioural training before she could be successfully re-homed.She said: You need to spend quite an extensive amount of time with her. She is really worried about new people and once she finds one person then thats it.She needs a strict adult-only home and behaviour training and she is a dog who was initially worried about everything.Lilly also suffers from age-related arthritis and needs help getting into vehicles, but loves going on car rides and can go for group walks with other dogs.She has managed to develop a close bond with one of the volunteers at the Dogs Trust, proving she can learn to trust humans again.Likes:CuddlesWalksCar ridesNeeds: A quiet homeBehavioural trainingMultiple visits to form bonds with potential adoptersToabout Lilly you can go hereLouise added: She is very suspicious and it would require a prolonged introduction.Its hard to say how long it would take but it would take multiple weeks. It is a matter of trying to create this situation for Lilly where she associates new people with positive things.Somewhere down the line the emotional trust left her sometime ago.People are breedist and she is a big, powerful dog and because we say she cant have contact with children and she has specic needs combined that with her breed it would go against her.She isnt some demon dog but we are hopeful weve managed to capture her personality and shes been through a lot in her le.She was the emotional collateral damage in the stress and breakdown that leads to a orce.Louise and the volunteers at the Shrewsbury Dogs Trust have not given up on finding a home for Stevie and Lilly, but they dont recommend adopting a dog for Christmas.She added: We should be able to transfer that relationship that we have established in the centre to a home.We never put down a healthy dog and we have never given up on them.It ties in with the message the dog is for le and not for Christmas and because they are looking for a peculiar environment it makes it tricky and dficult sometimes.Both loving dogs are available for adoption now.If you have what Stevie and Lilly are looking for then contact the Shrewsbury Dogs Trust call   or visit www.dogstrust.org.ukOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But there is still work to do.Top-down control over who gets a chance to be a candidate is demoralising and messy.And they are still outnumbered by Labour’s membership. It’s time to ride the Boris wave and add , new members to the blue ranks.If Labour keep telling themselves Magic Grandad is perfect, and blaming the voters, then this is a chance for the Conservatives to steal a march.WHILE this dwindling decade was stuffed full of exciting political events, it was not a vintage era for decisive majority ­government.There have been thrills — from voters defying Project Fear to free our country from the EU, through to Boris ­Johnson’s crushing victory over Corbynism.And there have been spills — David Cameron’s abrupt exit from power, Theresa May’s loss of her majority, and the hijack of the Labour Party by the far Left. But there have been only a few moments — mere months in the past ten years — of certain, stable, clear government.We have had two hung parliaments, the uncomfortable alliance of the coalition, and a slim Tory majority which was swtly erted by the EU referendum.At Westminster’s worst, a Remainer Commons — helped by a self-indulgent Speaker — trapped a minority Government in office while denying it the power to do anything.It’s all been very entertaining, but entertainment value is not always a sign of great governmentToo often, hung parliaments and paralysed ministers proved unable to make urgent decisions.Important calls were postponed or fudged out of necessity, because the votes to get on with the job were simply not there.Smashing that obstacle to decision-making is one of the many things about the election result to celebrate.Getting Brexit done should only be the start of the changes made by a Government that at last has the chance to be radical and ambitious.Not everybody will be cheering, however. Obviously, the Opposition aren’t happy. And I expect we will soon see some signs of unhappiness from the upper ranks of the civil service, too.Why  First, because theof majority government is a rude intrusion into the lives of civil service chiefs after a decade in which they got used to getting their own way.The absence of clear authority under May, and before that the many tensions and fractures of the coalition years, offered plenty of opportunity for determined mandarins to manage things just as they liked. No longer.Second, because the days in which the civil service was truly neutral, from top to bottom, have sadly ended — and a troubling number of officials seem to feel it is their role to promote a particular view.Brexit has exposed that bias. In the referendum campaign, public bodies which should know better allowed themselves to be used to pump out Remain propaganda, damaging their reputations.The agenda — to try to delay, disrupt and deny Brexit — was obvious. The election result has at last convinced all but the most diehard EU fans that we really are going to leave.But this is not the only issue on which the Government and parts of officialdom disagree.From Michael Gove’s criticism of experts, to Downing Street’s belief that Whitehall is overdue for radical restructuring and reform, there are changes on the way which will disrupt a state of affairs that rather suited a lot of senior people.If the New Year sees whole departments abolished or merged, and a new culture of ministers challenging the sacred cows of Whitehall thinking, then the machine will fight back, hoping to undermine change and keep things the same. There are three ways for ministers and their advisers to defend against that assault.First, steel themselves for a bumpy ride. They’ll be briefed against by past masters of the targeted Whitehall leak who have little to lose. They must not let themselves be knocked off course.Second, they must find allies. For every hidebound part of the civil service, there are others chafing to see things done better. Bring them on board.Third, they should make full use of their power to make public appointments.Labour stuffed the ious quangos and commissions with like-minded people, with similar principles and priorities.Why wouldn’t they  It would be bizarre for a government to appoint its opponents to wield state power against its agenda.And yet that is exactly what the Tories have too often done, apparently through a misguided sense of fair play.It’s time to realise that the other side neverthe favour. Boris and his team know that the election was the start, not the end, of their job.They have to deliver the change that they promised, to fulfil the trust voters put in them. There are battles ahead to make that happen, and wrestling Whitehall will be one of the biggest.

Sunday Political Editor David Wooding hands out his annual gongs – The Wooders.Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson deluded herself she would be the next PM and toured the land in a coach bearing her giant mugshot on the side.But she didn’t even manage to win her own seat back.At least it cheered up the second most annoying party leader, the SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon, who punched the air in glee at claiming her Scots rival’s scalp.You wait two years for a Labour star to jump ship — then he does it twice in a few weeks.Following his aborted leadership bid, Chuka Umunna launched a new party, Change UK.But he became so fond of change, he did it again and joined the Lib Dems.Now he’s coping with more change after voters booted him out.Expelled left-winger Derek Hatton is readmitted into the Labour Party after a -year wait — only to be kicked out again  hours later.Comeback king Nigel Farage launched the Brexit Party.But within hours, pranksters registered its email address as a porn site.He was swamped with offers from East European women offering a “stress-free” massage.Bet he needed a rub down after his party bombed in the election.John Bercow stood down as Commons Speaker after ten years and was then accused of demanding £million to appear on TV’s I’m A Celebrity.He denied the claims but Brexit-backing MPs would happily have paid Remainer Bercow handsomely to get him out of the Westminster jungle.Naughty-but-nice Trade Secretary Liz Truss attended The Big Sausage event in Norfolk, saying it was, “ticking rather a lot of my boxes”.Asked to try a Gloucester Old Spot banger, she enthused: “That’s one of the best offers I’ve had all year.”It perhaps explains why Liz enjoyed working in a well-hung Parliament so much.Housing minister James Brokenshire showed off his new kitchen which boasts FOUR matching ovens.The revelation must have left the PM wondering where to put his “oven-ready” Brexit deal.It prompted one stunned MP to ask: “Is he running a pizza business on the side ”A miserable year for Jeremy Corbyn as his party and football team tanked.After his election defeat, the Labour leader assured fellow Arsenal fans he wouldn’t be applying for the vacant job of Gunners team boss.Just as well, as he’d probably borrow £billion to buy more left wingers and strikers but remain neutral on whether to play in Europe.Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg was dubbed “insolent” and “insufferable” when he reclined almost horizontally on the Commons’ green benches during a late-night Brexit debate.He refused to budge, amid cries of, “Sit up, man!”But the posh wind-up merchant smiled and nodded when one angry MP sarcastically suggested he should be supplied with a pillow.Spoon-bending psychic Uri Geller vowed to use his “telepathic powers” to stop Jeremy Corbyn becoming PM.After the election, he claimed he influenced Boris Johnson’s landslide victory by giving him a spoon energised with “mind positivity”.Chris “Failing” Grayling quit as Transport Secretary after a string of Brexit planning blunders — including awarding a cross-Channel ferry contract to a firm with no ships.Labour Deputy Leader Tom Watson shed st in two years by giving up sugar and taking up exercise.He became so thin that Corbynista “assassins” missed their target in a plot to oust him.Slimline Watson then decided to cast off his ­political baggage and quit as an MP.Shadow Education Secretary Angela ­Rayner has been showered with compliments about her figure after going on a “half-portions” diet.She quipped: “Fat birds don’t win elections.”Neither do slim turkeys when Corbyn is leader.Boris Johnson almost botched his leadership bid after a “screaming row” with his girlfriend over a wine stain on her sofa.Police were called by neighbours who reported “a lot of smashing” from the home he shared with Carrie Symonds.What happened next remains secret.Perhaps it was a ­cover-up — by an upholstery firm.Cops ordered a McDonald’s outlet to stop selling milkshakes during a rally by Nigel Farage in Edinburgh — in case they were used as missiles by customers.The Brexit Party boss completed the visit unscathed, only to be “milkshaked” in Newcastle.Loveable No pup Dilyn outshines ­Cameron, May, Johnson and even Larry the Downing Street cat.The seven-month-old Jack Russell-cross from an animal rescue charity moved in with BoJo’s girlfriend Carrie and always steals the show at official receptions.A real yappy ending.Hapless Karen Bradley admitted she didn’t believe a word she said as Northern Ireland Secretary.She dropped a clanger by saying that killings by the military and police during The Troubles were not crimes — then rowed back, insisting: “I want to be very clear. I do not believe what I said. That is not my view.”Boris Johnson brandished a kipper at his leadership hustings.But his claim that he couldn’t have it delivered by post because of EU rules proved very fishy.Channel  replaced no-shows Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage with melting ice sculptures during a debate on climate change.Viewers probably judged their performance to be less drippy than Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson’s.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson was sacked after an inquiry into who leaked details of a National Security Council meeting over plans to allow Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to help build Britain’s G network.Downing Street said the PM had, “lost confidence in his ability to serve”, but he soon ed to Cabinet.All sounds a bit, er, phoney.Boris likened himself to The Incredible Hulk as he vowed to break free from EU shackles.But when he showed schoolkids an image of the superhero during a school visit, a boy pointed at the huge muscles and said: “You’ve got boobies.”She failed to secure a Brexit deal and lost the Tories’ majority.Yet Theresa May soldiered on with everyone against her.When toppled, she didn’t quit Parliament in a huff or carp endlessly from the backbenches but showed more loyalty to her successor than he gave to her.Mrs May could prove to be the finest ex-PM Britain ever had.Remainer lawyer Gina Miller blew thousands trying to stop Brexit — but unwittingly helped deliver it.Her court victory gave Brexit-blocker MPs the right to vote down Theresa May’s “soft” departure deal.But it set off a chain of events that put Bojo in No with a majority big enough to force through a much cleaner Brexit. Thanks, Gina.They spent the past three and a half years plotting to stop Brexit at every turn.But at the General Election, voters sent them a clear message: Leave Parliament.So good riddance to Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry, David Gauke, Laura Pidcock, Chuka Umunna, Jo Swinson, Philip Lee, Antoinette Sandbach and Sam Gyimah. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But just before we say goodbye to this year, I’ve been thinking about all the brilliant women who did brave, groundbreaking and seriously inspiring things in .Here, in no particular order, are my pick of those who really stood out — and hopefully will continue to do so for some time to come.It’s been a very mixed year for her. The country has had a tumultuous time, going to the polls and with two Prime Ministers.Her grandsons were apparently feuding and she had to be seen to be laying down the law to Prince Andrew.History may well judge  as her second annus horribilis.Yet somehow, this amazing woman has been the very definition of a dignied, strong and steady leader, offering us the stability and reassurance we as a country so desperately need.Yes, I know women’s football has been going on for years.But  was the year our Lionesses put it firmly on the map.Not only that, they have also inspired a generation of girls to get their boots on and play, knowing they can be just as good as boys on the pitch.So although it’s a shame it’s taken this long, we all owe them a debt of gratitude.I have long admired Emily for asking the hard questions on BBC’s Newsnight.But this year, in the face of the extreme hotting-up of Brexit, culminating in December’s General Election, her coverage has been second to none .Then her grilling of Prince Andrew in November was a masterclass in conducting a good interview — clinical, forensic and meticulous, without a hint of deference.Never shouty or confrontational, she gave Andrew the space to show himself to the public so they could make up their own minds about his culpability in his relationship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.She also somehow managed not to make herself the storyalthough when Prince Andrew described Epstein’s actions as “unbecoming”, she took the chance to look as disgusted as we all feel.“Unbecoming ” she said. “He was a sex offender.”In short, she nailed him.That photo of her wearing the world’s most beautul dress, martini and cigarette in hand at the Emmys after-party, said it all.Earlier in the night she had won three of the four Emmys she was up for — just more in a long line of awards and accolades this year, during which she proved the brilliance of Fleabag was not a one-off.Her sharp, witty and totally original writing on Killing Eve showed she is seriously clever as well as unbelievably glamorous.And her portrayal of women is original, transgressive and totally refreshing.No wonder she was drafted in to give her input and perspective on the next Bond movie.I have a feeling that in  we will realise Phoebe Waller-Bridge is only just getting started.She has had her first baby, conducted her first royal tour and guest edited Vogue. Oh, and she met Beyonce.All in all, not a bad year! She has also managed to consistently put on a brave and happy face while on the receiving end of more criticism than most of us could stand.But it is her le-long passion for and commitment to feminism I admire most.On International Women’s Day, she said: “Men can understand that they can be feminists,” and should feel comfortable about women being by their side, rather than behind them.As we know all too well, not everyone likes a strong woman. But because she is strong, my view is that she will win over her critics in the end.Leave it to the women to organise, unite and provide support to local women in their community and provide support for those affected by the terrible tragedy of the Grenfell fire.Their aim is to provide a networking  and discussion forums for women and arrange positive actions and initiatives that will help the community. But above all, they want to remember — which is why they organise a monthly silent walk in memory of their “lost angels”.My heart breaks for them that they have to do this.But what a brilliant reminder of the power of organisation and women coming together to support each other.Earlier this year, at an equal pay tribunal brought against the BBC by the TV and radio presenter, Samira said she: “Could not understand how pay for me, a woman, could be so much lower than Jeremy Vine, a man, for presenting very similar programmes and doing very similar work . . .“I just ask why the BBC thinks I am worth only a sixth of the value of the work of a man for doing a very similar job.”On behalf of every woman who has felt she should have said something, should have done something, should have spoken out, stood up or walked out when they knew they were being paid less than men in similar roles, but who felt they had no choice but to put up with it, I salute her.I also want to give a mention to the captain of the US women’s soccer team.Yes, she is a great player. But people have lined up to criticise her because she is another strong woman who seems genuinely not to care what people think of her and what she says.They describe her in the US as a “badass” and there is no doubt that she is outspoken on every issue going.But it is her ongoing campaign to normalise gay relationships in sport that really resonates with me.Working in a sport where no male has ever come out as gay while playing in the Premier League, it seems sad — and unacceptable — that people can’t be open about being gay.I think Megan is helping to change that, though.Asked in an interview how it felt to lead the US team, she replied: “Go gays!”She continued: “You can’t win a championship without gays on your team. It’s never been done before. Ever.”Could any collection of amazing women be complete without a mention of the -year-old schoolgirl who has started an international revolution Everything this young woman has done — and she has done more than anyone I can think of to raise awareness about the climate emergency — has been made so much more impressive because of her tenacity in the face of such extreme criticism.Most of the youngster’s critics seem to be men of a certain age who are, I guess, threatened by someone so young and female being so bold, opinionated and unconcerned about what they think.Amazingly, the insults and attacks seem only to have empowered her further and fuelled her determination to make the world listen to what we need to do to try to stop climate change in its tracks.A slip of a girl — and a teen at that — is changing the world.Bravely, and in the face of extreme confrontation at times, she has created a movement where millions around the world follow her and listen to her.She has turned down many accolades because she is not in it for the adulation. She really just wants to make change happen. Truly inspirational.A bit like female Prime Ministers, female newspaper editors are a rarer breed than male ones.Women have such an important role to play in journalism and in fighting for equality.And now, for the first time in  years, there will be a female editor of the Financial Times, which really is groundbreaking, given the paper has been such a bastion of male power for so long.Roula is going to do a magnicent job, not least because she is so focused on increasing newsroom ersity and attracting more female readers, which gives her an obvious spot among my Women of the Year.And a final mention must go to Dr Nyla Raja, purely for personal reasons.She has transformed my skin this year.Everyone needs a great facial and a little help . . . and boy, does she deliver!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Always tried to prove myself, always had sharp elbows.“I get paid a good salary to ask the hard questions that people at home would want answered.”AskedPM Boris Johnson was ‘running scared’ of being interviewed by Andrew Neil ahead of the recent election, she said: “Obviously he was, because Andrew Neil is a sensational interviewer.“If I was advising Boris, I’d have said to him: “Do not go in front of Andrew Neil whatever you do.”“But as a journalist, a viewer and a voter, I want to hear what Boris Johnson thinks.

So that is exactly what we are doing.“This government believes in bringing everyone up, not in punishing those who succeed.“Getting Brexit done doesn’t just mean passing legislation, to me it means helping people so that they know the country works for them.”The new minimum pay level keeps the Chancellor on course to meet the pledge he made in October to push it up to £. by , which is two-thirds of median earnings.From my early years in Rochdale and Bristol to my time serving as a cabinet minister, this is my personal mission. Because this government believes in bringing everyone up, not in punishing those who succeed.That means levelling up across regions which have been neglected for too long levelling up our public services by investing in new hospitals, , police and making vocational education a leline of opportunity for young people. And levelling up by helping ordinary working people deal with the cost of living.Lower paid workers are crucial to our economy, whether carers for our elderly and disabled relatives, hospitality staff ensuring we have a great festive season or manufacturers producing world-class goods. Many of them were working over Christmas instead of being sat down and relaxed with loved ones.Because we’ve been responsible in managing the economy, employment is at record high. But this Government is also focused on helping people make their money go further and giving you and your family a better quality of le.In , we introduced the National Living Wage, which gave British workers their biggest pay rise in nearly two decades.I believe the best possible start to  for millions of hard-working people on lower wages is to give them a pay rise. So that is exactly what we are doing, by increasing the National Living Wage by an inflation-busting .% to £. - £ a year extra - for a full-time worker from April. I look back and think what a dference that percentage wage rise would have made for my parents.It’s the largest ever cash increase - proving that hard work does pay under this Government.But I am not stopping there. I confirmed last autumn that we had the ambition to end low pay over the next five years by setting a target for the NLW to reach two-thirds of average earnings in the coming years.And as well as paying more, we want more people to benefit. The NLW currently kicks in on your twenty fth birthday, but we want younger generations too to be able to secure good jobs, save towards a home and achieve their dreams. So while this year minimum wage rates for those workers, including apprentices, will also increase between .% and .%, I have announced plans to ensure that the highest rate is extended to workers aged  and over in , and to those aged  and over within five years.We know these rises must be paid for – so we’re being ambitious but responsible. We are carefully building our approach to ending low pay so jobs are protected with increases that businesses can plan for, while we invest in our public services so resource isn’t erted from the frontline to cover workforce pay.Getting Brexit done doesn’t just mean passing legislation, to me it means helping people so that they know the country works for them. So  will be the year of levelling up, because we are greater together than the sum of our parts. Happy New Year.Boris Johnson also said the move helps correct the injustice of “for too long, people haven’t seen the pay rises they deserve”.The PM added: “As we enter a new decade, we’re setting our sights higher, to help people earn more over the next five years and level up access to opportunity across our great country”.Younger workers will also get wage boosts, with the rate for - year olds going up by .% from £. to £. an hour.There is a .% increase for - year olds, from £. to £., and a .% increase from £. to £. for under s.Since the National Living Wage was introduced in , the nation’s lowest paid who do a  hour week will have had a wage increase of £,.After years of “Spreadsheet Phil”and his Brexit fearmongering, this is exactly the boost Britain needs — both for the economy and spirit.So let’s join the three million who’ll be toasting Mr Javid on New Year’s Eve. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This makes them a desirable option for couples who want to legally recognise their relationship but dont have a particular religion.There is also no exchanging of vows, no recognised religious leader carrying out the ceremony and no singing of hymns at a civil partnership.Instead, couples sign the civil partnership document and become known as civil partners - rather than husband and we.Dissolving a civil partnership is similar to marriage but adultery cannot be used as a reason for ending the relationship.Julie and Keith met  years ago while working as journalists but made the decision not to tie the knot because they saw it as traditionally being rooted in patriarchy and religion.She said: We have had a very successful relationship for  years and a bit of paper is not going to make any dference to that whatsoever.While Keith added: As a man, I think it is absolutely crucial that we stand up against this long-standing domination by men over womens rights, and we need to do something about it.I am playing my small part in that.And Ann Chamings and partner John Eccles — together for  years — will tie the knot at Hastings Town Hall today.

Child mortality is at record low levels. Famine virtually went extinct. Malaria, polio and heart disease are declining.Ever since I wrote The Rational Optimist, in , I’ve been faced with, “what about. . . ” questions: What about the great recession, the euro crisis, Syria, Ukraine, Donald Trump  How can I possibly say that things are getting better, given all that The answer is: Because bad things happen while the world still gets better.That is to say, our population and economy would grow, but we would learn how to reduce what we take from the planet. And so it has proved.Scientist Andrew McAfee documented this in his book More From Less, showing how some nations are beginning to use less metal, less water and less land.This does not quite fit with what the Extinction Rebellion lot are telling us.But the next time you hear Sir David Attenborough say: “Anyone who thinks you can have infinite growth on a planet with finite resources is either a madman or an economist,” ask him this: “But whateconomic growth means using less stuff, not more ”For example, a drink can contains  grams of aluminium, much of it recycled. In  it contained  grams.Substituting the former for the latter is a contribution to economic growth, but it reduces the resources consumed per drink.As for Britain, our consumption of “stuff” probably peaked around the turn of the century. The evidence is there.In  Chris Goodall, an investor in electric vehicles, published research showing the UK was now using not just relatively less stuff every year, but absolutely less.Events have since vindicated his thesis. The quantity of all resources consumed per person in Britain fell by a third between  and , from . tonnes to . tonnes.That’s a faster decline than the increase in the number of people, so it means fewer resources consumed overall.Think about your own home. Mobile phones have the computing power of room-sized computers of the s. I use mine instead of a camera, radio, torch, compass, map, calendar, watch, CD player newspaper and a pack of cards.LED light bulbs consume about a quarter as much electricity as incandescent bulbs for the same light. Modern buildings generally contain less steel and more of it is recycled. Offices use much less paper.Even in cases when the use of stuff is not falling, it is rising more slowly than expected.For instance, how much water the world consumed in  was half as much as experts in the s predicted. Inventiveness allowed more efficient irrigation for agriculture, the biggest user of water.Until recently, most economists assumed these improvements were almost always in vain, becauseyou cut the cost of something, people would just use more of it. Make lights less energy hungry and people leave them on for longer.But Andrew McAfee argues that doesn’t hold up. Suppose you switch from incandescent to LED bulbs in your house and save about three-quarters of your electricity bill for lighting. You might leave more lights on for longer, but surely not four times as long.Efficiencies in agriculture mean the world is now approaching “peak farmland”. Despite the growing number of people and their demand for more and better food, the productivity of agriculture is rising so fast that human needs can be supplied by a shrinking amount of land.In , Jesse Ausubel, of The Rockefeller University in New York, and his colleagues argued that thanks to modern technology, we use  per cent less land to produce a given quantity of food compared with  years ago.By  it is estimated that an area the size of India will have been released from the plough and the cow.Perhaps the most surprising statistic is that Britain is using steadily less energy.John Constable, of the Global Warming Policy Forum think tank, points out that although the UK’s economy has almost trebled since , and our population is up by  per cent, energy consumption has fallen by almost ten per cent.This is not necessarily good news, Constable argues. Although the improving energy efficiency of light bulbs, planes and cars is part of the story, it also means we are importing more embedded energy in products, having driven much of our steel, aluminium and chemical industries abroad with some of the world’s highest energy prices.In fact, all this energy-saving might cause problems.Innovation requires experiments . Experiments require energy. So cheap energy is crucial.Thus, energy may be the one resource that a prospering population should be using more of.Since its inception, the environmental movement has been obsessed by finite resources. The two books that kicked off the green industry in the early s, The Limits To Growth, in America, and BlueprintFor Survival, in Britain, both lamented the imminent exhaustion of metals, minerals and fuels.The Limits To Growth predicted thatgrowth continued, the world would run out of gold, mercury, silver, tin, zinc, copper and lead well before . School textbooks soon echoed these claims.This caused the economist Julian Simon to challenge the ecologist Paul Ehrlich to a bet that five metalswould cost less in  than in .The Stone Age did not end for lack of stone, Simon said, arguing that we would find substitutesmetals grew scarce.Simon won the bet easily, and Ehrlich sniped that: “The one thing we’ll never run out of is imbeciles.”To this day, none of those metals has signicantly risen in price nor run out. A modern irony is that many green policies advocated now would actually reverse the trend towards using less stuff.A wind farm requires far more concrete and steel than a system based on gas. Environmental opposition to nuclear power has hindered the generating system that needs the least land, least fuel and least steel or concrete per megawatt.Burning wood instead of coal in power stations means the exploitation of more land — and even higher emissions. Organic farming uses more land than conventional methods.Technology has put us on a path to a cleaner, greener planet. We don’t need to veer in a new direction. To do so risks retarding progress.As we enter the third decade of this century, I’ll make a prediction.By the end of it we will see less poverty, less child mortality, less land devoted to agriculture.There will be more tigers, whales, forests and nature reserves. Britons will be richer and each of us will use fewer resources.The global political future may be uncertain, but the environmental and technological trends are pretty clear — and pointing in the right direction. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Instead it has unleashed a nightmare.Perhaps instead of lecturing us on Brexit, Blair should reflect on his devastating legacy.IN her bid to become the next Labour leader, Rebecca Long-Bailey has promised “progressive patriotism”.It sounds as nonsensical as the party’s economic policies. After all, there’s nothing “progressive” about this vile, anti-semitic version of the party.Nor is there anything “patriotic” about Long-Bailey’s loyalty to Jeremy Corbyn, the man who counts Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA as his friends.So it comes as no surprise that Corbyn’s cronies are apparently trying to shorten the Labour leadership contest in order to boost Long-Bailey’s chances and “stitch-up” other hopefuls.Her proclamation of patriotism shows utter desperation.Labour spent years treating anyone who’s proud to be British as lowle scum, only to have that backfire on them at the election.Many are proud of this country and enthusiastic about Brexit.It’s a bit too late for Corbynistas to pretend they feel the same.IT looks set to be a very happy New Year for many British workers.Chancellor Sajid Javid has announced that the minimum wage for over s will rise by p to £. an hour in April.After years of “Spreadsheet Phil” Hammond and his Brexit fearmongering, this is exactly the boost Britain needs — both for the economy and spirit.So let’s join the three million who’ll be toasting Mr Javid on New Year’s Eve. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Things can only improve on the last four years of anger, ision and political paralysis.A period which should have been pivotal to our country saw it barely governed at all. That all changed at pm on December .Boris Johnson’s thumping election win gives us the greatest opportunity for radical renewal since at least .That means finally achieving Brexit  days from now and then, we hope, rapidly ­striking trade deals with Brussels and the world’s greatest economies.It means a dramatic, imaginative ­Budget to turbo-charge both those “left-behind” regions which voted Tory for the first time and the wider economy.We share too the  vision of our readers: For huge NHS investment to continue and a long-term social care solution be put in place.That tax breaks and rate cuts must renew our dilapidated High Streets and help small firms thrive and create jobs.That rough sleeping must be slashed, even ended. That wages must be driven up and food banks rendered redundant.That the Tories must continue striving for a cleaner environment without ­caving in to economy-wrecking panic.And we of course share the desire for a kinder, more united country — echoed by the open letter from faith, ­culture, sport and business leaders.The Sun is optimistic about that too.In fact we do not agree we have suffered a “decade of ision”. Yes, it was tough financially. But we were far from ided at, say, the  Olympics.The anger in our Parliament, offices, factories and homes was caused by Brexit, specically by some Remainers’ refusal to accept defeat, and by a Labour Party engulfed by the hostile hard-left.The Brexit heat is fast dissipating now. Boris’s triumph saw to that. Many Remainers are making their peace with it . . . and even seeing its opportunities.Which leaves but one obstacle to the national healing.No one has done more to ide us than Jeremy Corbyn, his thuggish, often anti-Semitic followers and his obnoxious media apologists.Their relentless hatred and dishonest demonisation of opponents toxied both political discourse and Labour’s election fortunes.Yet none of the contenders to replace Corbyn grasps this reality: They can remain a Twitter-obsessed, Tory-hating clique of middle-class Marxist posers calling each other “comrade” but disconnected from working people.Or be viable, mainstream contenders for Government.

This year they pulled off a plastic-free Glastonbury, despite a few hiccups.We’ve long stopped grumbling about taking our own bags to the supermarket and got used to stuffing our pockets with them when we leave the house.So now in England, the average person uses less than a tenth of the number of single-use plastic bags than we did five years ago. Only around ten a year, compared to  in .As electric cars have improved, we’ve all been seduced — and not just by Tesla’s new “bulletproof” Cybertruck. Overall, demand for electric cars has jumped, with the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders finding that this November alone electric car sales leaped by . per cent, with more than three times as many new battery-electric vehicles registered as in the same month in .Nowhere  is it clearer that green has become the new black than in fashion, where criticism of fast fashion has led to trends for vintage, second hand and renting rather than buying.On the high street, companies such as HM have launched their “conscious collection” , fashion bible Vogue has championed sustainable designs, while French President Emmanuel Macron’s “fashion pact” — presented at the G summit and intended to make the industry more sustainable — has been signed by more than  brands, including Nike, Zara and Gap.All these changes prove how far we have come and the impact Greta has had.Hearing her, strong and calm, on Radio ’s Today programme this week, what struck me is that now another change is needed.This time a sht not in our actions, but in how we approach the environmental debate.It’s not beliefs but attitudes that need to change. Until now, environmental issues have been too isive.Butwe want real change we’ve got to move beyond blame.It puts people off environmental issues when campaigners hector and shame them.When wealthy celebrities such as Sir David Attenborough criticise normal people for taking holidays with cheap flights, or actress Emma Thompson jets back from America to harass normal people driving to work.In the same way Extinction Rebellion threatens to lose potential supporters when it starts fights with commuters trying to board their morning train or cause mayhem in central London.The real danger is that by being so aggressive, these green campaigners risk putting people off.Greta seems to know this. She is much calmer than she used to be when speaking in public.Rather than getting angry or emotional, instead she has stressed the importance of just, “listening to the scientists”.As usual, we could learn from her.The reality is most people want to be green.We are all concerned about global warming, pollution in the seas and the kind of planet we are creating for our grandkids. But you can’t shame people into doing something.Diesel drivers — especially White Van Man — shouldn’t be harassed just for getting to work. I’m sure they would buy more environmentally friendly vehiclesthey could afford to.Likewise, no one should be shamed for taking a flight — who knows what other measures they might be taking, such as living in a carbon neutral home What the planet needs least is more fighting.

Rules, benefit systems - even the date weaposre going to leave the EU - have been repeatedly chopped and changed. And many of the changes made to our laws and budgets donapost take effect immediately. Most will involve some lead time before the changes come into force - so itaposs easy to forget whataposs coming up. So weaposve rounded up  of the major changes to UK law, benefits, financial and employment rules that are set to take place in . They include increases to the minimum wage, new rights for gig economy workers and changes to the laws on gay marriage and abortion in Northern Ireland. Read on to see how theyaposll affect you and your family. January : Rail fares rise by .% Rail fares are to jump by an average of .% as the latest inflation-linked hike kicks in. Some long-distance commuters will see the annual cost of getting to work increase by more than £ on  January. It means a £, season ticket will rise by £., while a London to Guildford annual ticket, which typically costs £, will rise by £ to £,. January : Gay marriage is legalised in Northern Ireland Northern Irelandaposs ban on same-sex marriage will officially come to an end, after Westminster politicians stepped in and changed the law. Although the weddings will be legal from this date, bureaucracy means the first civil same-sex marriages are expected to take place on the week of Valentineaposs Day. March : Alcohol minimum pricing launches in Wales The Welsh Government is planning on a new law setting minimum alcohol prices, WalesOnline reports. Currently set to come into force on March , , ministers want retailers and bars to charge a minimum of p per unit - meaning a can of cider could cost at least £ and a bottle of wine, £.. Health minister Vaughan Gething confirmed the start date in a statement to Assembly members in October. However, the regulations which will set out the timetable and minimum prices, still need to be approved by the Welsh Assembly. The policy has already been delayed from last summer. March : The right to request decent affordable broadband Hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses have the choice of slow broadband, hideously expensive broadband, or no broadband. Thataposs set to end for many with a new right called the Universal Service Obligation. From March , anyone can request a connection that can deliver  megabits per seconddownload speed and  Mbps upload speed and costs less than £ per month. If you donapost have internet of this quality, you have the legal right to request it, as long as the installation would cost less than £,. If it costs more, you can still have broadband installed but may have to pay the excess cost. The scheme is being administered by BT and KCOM in Hull. Once a request is made, there are set standards for how quickly they must assess and deliver on requests. March : Abortion is made legal in Northern Ireland From the end of March, women in Northern Ireland will be allowed to terminate pregnancies without fear of prosecution. That means the region will be brought in line with the rest of the UK by the beginning of April. The change was approved by the UK Parliament as part of the Northern IrelandBill - introducing the law in the absence of the collapsed devolved government. From April, abortion services will be available from two hospitals. Buffer zones will be in place to prevent protests outside the centres. Itaposs thought around , will take place each year in Northern Ireland. April : Councils can double council tax for empty homes  Property owners can already face Council Tax bills increasing by %they leave properties vacant for more than two years. And from April, that figure increases to % - potentially doubling the charge for homes left empty for long periods of time.  April : Hospital parking charges axed - for some Hospital parking charges for thousands of NHS patients and staff will be scrapped in England from April . Blue badge holders, frequent outpatients and parents of sick kids are among the groups that will benefit from the Tory pledge - which comes after a long Mirror campaign. But not all NHS staff and patients will get free parking, as they would have done under Labouraposs plans. Instead of being scrapped altogether, the £m-a-year paid to park at NHS hospitals will be scaled back by just under a third, saving patients and staff up to £m a year. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it would prioritise those with the greatest need adding: One of the concerns mentioned regularly on the doorsteps was that vulnerable people, and staff working nights, have to pay for hospital car parking. So we are today delivering on our manesto commitment and setting out our new approach to NHS hospital parking charges.  Weaposre currently expecting a new rate of £. for those aged  and over, up from £. an hour now, but the exact figure canapost be confirmed yet. New hourly rates for the following April are announced in the Budget, which we are only expecting in February due to delays around the election. April : Changes to rights for agency and gig economy workers Currently, when people who earn ying amounts of money from week-to-week - particularly those on flexible contracts - take a paid holiday, the employer has to pay them holiday pay which equates to the average weekly wage they earned over the  weeks before that holiday. From April , , that is changing. Employers will have to calculate the average weekly wage from an entire year -  weeks - rather than just  weeks. The reform is intended to improve the holiday pay for seasonal workers, who tend to lose out over the way it is currently calculated. Written statement Employers will also be required to provide a aposstatement of particularsapos on day one of employment - which must include:Hours and days of the week the worker employee is required to work, whether they may be ied and how Entitlements to paid leave Details of any probationary period Details of training provided by the employerParental bereavement leave Way back in , the Government backed a Private Members bill which proposed giving workers the right to unpaid leave of up to two weeks, as a right, from day one of their employment, should they suffer the tragedy of their child dying under the age of . This became law in September, , and is expected to come into force in early . While most employers do give discretionary compassionate leave in such tragic circumstances, some do not. This law, which also applies to women who suffer a stillbirth or miscarriage from the th week of pregnancy, changes that. April : National Insurance is cut by up to £ a year The Tories pledged to raise national insurance thresholds in their manesto. From April, you will pay no national insurance contributions on the first £, of your earnings - up from £, at the moment - working out as a saving of around £ a year.The move has been criticised for falling short of the £-a-year Boris Johnson promised, and only helping better earners who are already over the threshold.For others itaposs not quite the all out win you might think - with the move meaning some of the worst off might now miss out on some of their state pension as a result. Steven Cameron, pensions director at Aegon, said: “Under current rules, those not paying any NI lose out on credits towards their state pension. Iniduals need  years of qualying NICs to receive the full state pension with those with fewer qualying years seeing a reduction and receive nonethey have fewer than  years of credits.” April : Tories will let families inherit £million tax free - finishing what George Osborne started Families will be able to pass £m of their wealth without Inheritance Tax when they die. Currently someone who dies can leave £, of their estate tax-free. But Tory George Osborne added an extra extra tax-free amount that applies only to property. In April this extra portion rises from £, to £, - meaningsomeone owns a home, they can leave £, tax free. This doublesa couple is married. April : Student loan repayments will fall  People paying back student loans get a minor tax break in April too. Recent graduates will be able to earn £, a year before payments kick in - up from £, this year. That should save them £. in payments a year. People who graduated between  and  will see their threshold rise too - from £, a year to £,. April : State pension will rise by .% The state pension will rise by .% from April - more than double the rate of inflation. Such an increase means pensioners can expect an rise of just over £ per week on the New State Pension from the current rate of £.. But hundreds of thousands of over-s will see around half their pension rise wiped out by the cost of paying for their own TV licence, after the benefit was scrapped. Tory ministers pledged to protect the state pension with a apostriple lockapos. That means it rises by inflation, .% or average earnings - whichever is highest. Average weekly earnings rose by .% in the year to May to July . April : Benefit freeze ends After almost a decade of freezes and caps, about . million people on Universal Credit and millions more on legacy benefits will get a .% increase in April. The increase means someone on £ a month in benefits will get an extra £.. But it is less than the rise in average earnings and less than the rise in pensions. April: Council tax to rise Local authorities will get the power to raise council tax by up to % from April - % for general spending and % for social care. Thataposs worth an extra £ to on the average band D council tax home in England. Council-by-council rises will only be confirmed in February and March. June : The end of free TV Licences for over s TV Licences are free for over s, but from June  youaposll only get oneyouaposre receiving Pension Credit. Around million households are set to be affected.BBC chairman David Clementi said:“Copying the current scheme was ultimately untenable.But the Tories were slammed for breaking their promise to protect the benefit by handing over responsibility for it to the BBC. July or later: Millions will start being moved onto Universal Credit The limited pilot scheme for migrating existing benefit claimants onto Universal Credit is set to finish by July  and begin rolling out across the country shortly after. Current plans suggest it will take until  until the system is fully up and running. From July claimants moving from Income Support, income based Jobseekeraposs Allowance and Employment Support Allowance will get an extra two weeks of support from their old benefit while they transition onto Universal Credit. October : The state pension age will finish rising to  From October youaposll need to be at least  to get a state pension - whatever your gender. The age people can at has been rising for years - starting with increasing womenaposs state pension age until it matched menaposs, then increasing both from  to . AJ Bell analyst Tom Selby said: “The rise started incrementally in  and is scheduled to complete by October . That means anyone born after  October  will have a state pension age of at least . Itaposs not the last time it will rise though. The Conservatives have set out plans to increase the state pension age again to  by  and  by , Selby added.

These are just some of the fascinating details revealed this week in official documents from the s and aposs, newly declassied by National Archives in Dublin and London. The files were released under the  year rule -  years in Ireland - which requires secret documents to be declassied after two decades unless there is a good reason not to. UK documents are revealed by the National Archives at Kew unless they would cause damage to the countryaposs image, national security or foreign relations. In the UK, documents are released twice a year in August and January - but theyaposre still playing catch-up with declassications, after the time limit was reduced from  years to  in . Hereaposs a round-up of the most interesting stories that emerged in this yearaposs releases. . Nuclear weapons could be hidden inside a Northern Ireland mountain  Nuclear weapons could be sited at underground facilities inside a mountain in Northern Ireland, Dublin’s most senior intelligence official advised the government. Colonel L Buckley, then Ireland’s Director of Intelligence, was asked for a briefing for Irish Minister of Foreign Affairs Peter Barry on the possibility of nuclear missiles being on the island in November . In a response marked “Confidential”, Buckley complains that he doesn’t have “the monitoring or surveillance systems” to confirm the movements of UK ships, aircraft and support systems. “Suffice to say any such information would be given the highest security classication and only be available to UK or or other military personnel on the strictest ‘need-to-know’ basis at the highest level,” he added.  But he said the harbour at Sydenham in Belfast could accommodate Royal Navy or Nato ships “equipped with nuclear missiles or weapons”. And he said a military base at Benbradagh Mountain,overlooking Dungiven in Co Derry, the second highest mountain in the Sperrins which was used by US forces during the Cold War to communicate with its north Atlantic fleet, could hold nuclear weapons. “Ben Bradaigh NEof Dungiven has underground facilities, which were originally constructed by US forces for the storage of conventional high explosives but were subsequently redesigned and are understood to be suitable for the storage of nuclear weaponsso required,” he wrote.  Margaret Thatcher “grabbed her handbag” and “stormed out” of a meeting with the Belgian prime minister in a row over the extradition of an Irish priest wanted in London over alleged connections to the IRA A senior Tory adviser told an Irish diplomat about the incident by way of contrasting Thatcher’s “quite natural” way with then Irish Taoiseach Charlie Haughey, adding there was “a lot to be played for between them”.  . Thatcher kept wrongly convicted Birmingham Six in jail to dodge scandal The Thatcher government was reluctant to free the Birmingham Six because of pressure from Tory hardliners and concerns it would cause a “scandal”. A Home Office official admitted the fears to Irish diplomats  years ago. The Irish government was leaned on not to pursue their case with the European Court of Human Rights. PM Margaret Thatcher’s government also feared a backlash from the media. Paddy Hill, Gerry Hunter, Johnny Walker, Hugh ­Callaghan, Richard McIlkenny and Billy Power were freed in  for one of the worst miscarriages of justice after being ly convicted in  for the Birmingham pub bombings that killed  people in November .  . Thatcheraposs fury over aposher boysapos killed in Northern Ireland Margaret Thatcher had warned Northern Ireland’s police chief that she would no longer send “her boys over in waves to be killed” in a rancorous row over who was to blame for the slaughter of eight soldiers in an IRA bomb. Sir John Hermon, then chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, was upset by the “neo-colonial connotations” and “World War I overtones” of the Prime Minister’s dressing down, which he took as distancing of herself from the region, newly declassied files disclose. The IRA detonated a massive roadside bomb, containing  pounds of semtex, as an unmarked bus carrying members from the Light Infantry made its way along the A at Ballygawley, Co Tyrone, after midnight on August , . Eight soldiers - all aged between  and  - were killed and another  were injured. They had been making their way from the airport to their base at Omagh. Six months later, Sir John confided in a diplomat about the “panic reaction” from Downing Street in the wake of the attack as well as tensions between the police and the army over whose fault it was for the deadly security lapse.  . Tory who avoided aposblacks and Irishapos feared for apossecurity implicationsapos of allowing Irish MPAn aposunsavouryapos Tory MP who openly admitted avoiding the blacks and Irish in his constituency feared the security implications of allowing Irish politicians into Westminster .Nicholas Budgen, who took over Enoch Powell’s House of Commons seat for Wolverhampton South West, agreed to have lunch with Richard Ryan, a diplomat in the Irish Embassy in London, in March , a report of the meeting marked “confidential” shows. Ryan was trying to bolster support - and stymie opposition - to the nascent British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, made up of politicians in London and Dublin. . Officials feared John Major would have to aposhide behind plantapos as Bill Clinton visited UK  Officials feared the Prime Minister would be forced to hide behind a pot plant to avoid shaking a Sinn Fein leaderaposs hand. Aides were worried about a chance meeting between PM John Major and Sinn Feinaposs Gerry Adams during US President Bill Clintonaposs trip to the UK. The American President visited London and Belfast in November . Stormont aide Robert Crawford issued the alert for potential embarrassment in a memo to Mr Majoraposs private secretary, Edward Oakden. Mr Crawford wrote: Sinn Feinwill almost certainly be invited to the reception. “We cannot see a way of the Prime Minister avoiding Gerry Adams without reverting to the undignied hiding-behind-the-potted plants scenario, which creates almost as valuable a news story as the first handshake.  Ministers were accused of “manipulating” the grieving Dunblane community in the aftermath of the massacre of  children and their teacher. Parents of youngsters gunned down by murderer Thomas Hamilton demanded an urgent clarication from Prime Minister John Major days after the  tragedy, amid fears the Government was about to U-turn on a pledge to help, a newly-released letter reveals. Relatives were angered by reports Scottish Minister Michael Forsyth was abandoning a pledge to offer taxpayersapos money to rebuild the gym where Hamilton slaughtered five and six-year-olds. The PM and Mr Forsyth were among a delegation to visit the Scottish town after the March  attack. Mr Major confirmed to the headteacher that finding Government cash for the project would not be a problem. Gerry McDermott, spokesman for the school board of governors, said the gesture was a source of great comfort to the community, relieving strain from those most closely involved.  John Major skipped seeing Britainaposs only gold medal of the  Olympics because he wanted to watch cricket instead, official records suggest. Aides to the then Prime Minister tried to persuade him to fly to the US to attend the Atlanta Games. Plans included watching the final of the coxless pairs rowing, featuring Matthew Pinsent and Steve Redgrave, which delivered Britainaposs only gold medal at the Games. But cricket fan Mr Major pulled out of a three-night trip to America at the end of July, despite months of organisation behind the scenes, amid concerns from aides he would go to Englandaposs match with Pakistan. Downing Street private secretary Rachael Reynolds wrote to the PM saying: I understand that you are thinking of staying here for the Lordaposs Test in preference to going to the Olympics. “While having to declare certain personal interest here ... I do think it would be a pityyou were to give up going entirely.”  . Heathrow nearly had its name changed to pay tribute to Winston Churchill John Major considered renaming Heathrow Airport after Sir Winston Churchill. The then Prime Minister believed the idea of making Britain’s biggest airport a memorial to the Second World War leader was “intriguing”. The Tory leader asked senior Whitehall aides to explore the proposal after London businessman Harvey Spack suggested Sir Winston Churchill Airport was better than “stupid” Heathrow. The premieraposs reply to Mr Spack said: “Thank you for your letter of  September and for your intriguing idea about renaming Heathrow airport after Sir Winston Churchill. “I am looking into this, and I am grateful to you for raising it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"corbyn fans celebrate hidden message","story":"NewsCorbyn fans celebrate hidden message in London fireworks, but theres a problemSupporters of the outgoing Labour leader thought there was a nod to him in Sadiq Khans firework display - but theres another possibilityShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video sadiq-khans-hidden-message-london-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics corbyn-fans-celebrate-hidden-message-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - politicsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

No, some viewers of the BBCaposs coverage of the midnight fireworks around the London Eye saw a hidden message in the display about the outgoing Labour leader. Of course some of the display was literally hidden, because for some reason the BBCaposs helicopter decided to be downwind of the explosives and couldnapost see for a massive black cloud of smoke. And London Mayor Sadiq Khan has been accused of planting political messages in the display in previous years. Last year the display appeared to have an anti-Brexit tint to it - We Are Your Friends, Stay and Donapost Leave Me Alone were among songs chosen for the -minute soundtrack, which featured artists from Ireland, France, Sweden and where. And the London Eye was lit up to resemble a giant EU flag. But this yearaposs alleged message was a bit more ambiguous. During the display, the White Stripesapos Seven Nation Army was played. Of course Corbyn fans seized on this as a reference to The Absolute Boy. And while the inclusion of the song might have been a cheeky nod to Islington Northaposs once and future backbencher, there is another possibility. You see, as well as being an anthem beloved of the many, not the few, Seven Nation Army is frequently sung at sporting events.  One such sporting event, the football European Championship - or Euro  - is being held in London this year. The song was also sandwiched between two other sporting anthems. Before it was Three Lions by Baddiel, Skinner and the Lightning Seeds - which was originally written as Englandaposs anthem for Euro apos, the last time the tournament was held here.

As the UK prepares to leave the European Union in just  days, the Leave and Remain campaign chiefs call on the nation to finally begin the healing process – a plea echoed by the Archbishop of Canterbury in his New Year message. Three-and-a-half years since voters split by % to % to quit the EU, Matthew Elliott and Will Straw urge Britain to “leave behind a decade of ision and begin our decade of reconnection”. Mr Elliott was chief executive of Vote Leave, the official pro-Brexit campaign, while Mr Straw was his direct counterpart as executive director of Britain Stronger in Europe. They hope factions, friends and families separated by the passionate arguments surrounding the EU debate can now put aside their dferences. The identical demands spanning the political ide are aimed at moving on from the bitter isions which erupted in the run-up to the  referendum and which are yet to be bridged. Their message comes in an open letter signed by a cross-section of society leaders to mark the start of a new decade. Signatories include GMB union chief Tim Roache Confederation of British Industry director Dame Carolyn Fairbairn and Glastonbury Festival organiser Emily Eavis.  Faith chiefs, think tank bosses and British Olympic Association chairman Sir Hugh Robertson have also added their names. The letter says: “As we start this new year and new decade, our country feels more fragmented than any of us would like. “Too often we hear that our isions – by class or geography, by politics, age, race or by faith – have come to define us. “If we are not happy with the state of our society, it falls to us all to do something about it. “New Year is the time for resolutions and on this first day of the s, we urge others to join us in making a resolution for the new decade. “Our resolution is to reconnect. “To reach out to just one person we don’t know, or from whom we have drted apart. “To start rebuilding connections between neighbours and fellow citizens. “While our politics and media have become more polarised we, as people, have not.”Britain is still to recover from the rancour unleashed in the run-up to the landmark referendum.Just a week before polling day, Labour MP Jo Cox was murdered in her West Yorkshire constituency by a far-right extremist shouting: “Britain first!” Experts have blamed the Brexit debate for driving a rise in hate offences ever since.Racist or religious abuse incidents recorded by police in England and Wales jumped % in the month after the UK voted to quit the EU. Some , such crimes were logged in July , rising to , in July , according to the Home Office. Figures revealed in October last year showed an % year-on-year rise in race hate crimes recorded by officers. There were , offences in -, according to Home Office statistics. That compared with , in -, which included the referendum and subsequent months. Charities claimed the figures were the tip of the iceberg because many offences go unreported. The Home Office admitted at the time there had been short-term genuine rises in hate crime following certain events such as the Brexit referendum. In the aftermath of the EU vote, the National Police Chiefsapos Council revealed hate crimes reported to police soared % between polling day and the following Sunday, compared with the equivalent days four weeks earlier. The letter published today is the latest attempt to urge people to “find some common ground”. It goes on: There is much that we share with each other: sit any two people down together and they will find some common ground. “So the power of reconnection will depend on how many of us, as citizens, step up together. “Every institution, too – not just government but education, business, sport, civic society and faith – should play its part in helping bridge social ides. “Today is about a small first step that we can all take – to leave behind a decade of ision and begin our decade of reconnection.”  In his traditional New Year message, the Church of Englandaposs most senior minister, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, also pleads for chasms to be overcome and the UK to start healing isions. Archbishop Justin says he has been inspired by the heroism and hope of RNLI volunteers at Dover leboat station. In his message, broadcast on BBC at pm today, he says: As we wonder how we are going to start healing some of the isions that weaposve seen over recent years, the sort of people at this leboat station are signs of hope. Iaposve met some of the over  volunteers who are involved in keeping this station operational  hours a day,  days a year. “Itaposs not just a group of people working together, itaposs a family. The seagoing crew includes a student, a train driver, a chef, an electrician. The youngest is , the oldest is . When their pagers go off - day or night - theyaposre prepared to risk everything to rescue whoever needs their help. There are so many ways we can connect with others. “It could be by joining a voluntary organisation or a charity, it may be sorting food in a foodbank or joining a leboat crew. When we hear someone described as a Good Samaritan, we think about that person taking the time to help another. “But itaposs a story told by Jesus about someone taking the risk of reaching out to another who was very dferent to them. “Yes, the person needed help - but they also needed connection.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror after divisive decade","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: After isive decade its time for the Tremendous TwentiesIn the past decade, there were plenty of moments which have cast a terrible stain on this country’s history.

A new beginning. A new chance to get things right. And by goodness we need it. There were many great moments in the past decade – the London Olympics, two royal weddings and Nessa finally proposing to Smithy. But there were plenty more moments from which we can take no pride at all. Moments which have cast a terrible stain on this country’s history. The greed of underregulated bankers coupled with an ideological policy of austerity led to a decade of misery for many. Foodbanks, practically unheard of  years ago, popped up in almost every town and city. Rough sleepers lined our streets. Waiting lists for our brilliant but beleaguered NHS grew longer. The cult of inidualism took hold, crushing beneath it our nation’s greatest attributes: moderation, politeness and “agreeing to disagree”. Instead we disagreed on anything – and everything. RIPPED Brexit hammered a stake through our nation’s soul which the extremists, the know-it-alls and the downright evil pushed and pulled until we were ripped entirely in two. Technological change whirred so fast that promised winds of change became a destructive tornado. Billion dollar social media firms peddled fake news, meddled in elections and shared “how to” suicide guides for our kids. Amazon ravaged our high streets and sneered at our tax system. Smartphones intended to connect us only isolated us. We slipped into a loneliness crisis and mental health catastrophe. And so austerity, inidualism and technology allied themselves to fracture our communities and leave us adrt in a perfect storm of sadness. Hundreds of thousands of shops, libraries, pubs, youth clubs, bus services and bingo halls closed. The glue which holds this nation together dried up and flaked off. And all that time we continued to overheat, overuse and undervalue the planet on which we live. And yet. There is hope. There is always hope. For we are a country which has taken on greater challenges than those we face today – and survived. Looking around over the past few festive weeks we have all been reminded how the British sense of family, togetherness and having a laugh come what may, remains a potent force. And now, in this new decade, we must use this togetherness as the weapon with which we fight back. As Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby says tomorrow we must start healing the isions we’ve seen over recent years.  The Daily Mirror has been the Heart of Britain for  years. We are the voice of the millions of compassionate, decent, hard-working people who are the backbone of this nation. DEBATE We speak to and for readers on both sides of the Brexit debate, young and old, from the North and the South, in big cities and small towns. And this year we – readers and writers together – will do our bit to fight back against those who would ide us. We will step up our brilliant Britain Talks project which brings together people with dfering views over a cup of tea to find common ground. We will relentlessly battle against social media companies, online giants and gig economy employers who know the price of everything, but the value of nothing.  We will hold our politicians to account for the language they use and the promises they make. We will again throw open the doors of the Mirror newsroom to young people to report the news. But we’ll never ever take for granted our loyal, more senior readers. We will every day tell stories of how the indomitable British spirit has achieved great things, just as we do at the Mirror’s uplting Pride of Britain Awards.

He wants to make losing weight as easy to understand as possible and demysty the diet industry. Graeme explained: I wanted to break it down so people can understand it. There is so much rubbish out there and I wanted to tell them that thereaposs only one way you can lose weight and thataposs with a calorie deficit. People feel deprived and thataposs when they give up and start to binge - but you donapost need to feel deprived. So, whataposs the secret to losing weight without going on a diet  Itaposs super simple - just eat fewer calories than you use. And, insists Graeme, it doesnapost matter where you get these calories from. So gone are the grim Januaryaposs, eating nothing but lettuc, you can still tuck into your favourite pizza. Worried about going out for a curry  Donapost be, just make sure you eat fewer calories in the days leading up to your treat. But the absolutely vital thing you have to be able to do to make this work for you is to know exactly how many calories there are in the foods you eat. The former professional cricketer admits this can be tricky at first as some so-called aposhealth foodsapos can actually be laden with calories. And the calories in every day treats, like your morning coffee or that office biscuits or even sauces, can soon add up. But Graeme says as soon as people start to make themselves aware of how many calories are in most of their food, it becomes easy very quickly. He explained: The best diet for people to follow is the one they can stick to. People need to be more aware of the nutritional aspect of the food they are eating. It does time initially to work out how many calories are in what you are eating but eventually it will come naturally and youaposll be able to tell just by looking. Before launching his hugely successful social media carer, Graeme worked as a personal trainer. It was the sheer volume of companies selling diet products and plans that inspired him to offer his own advice on his own page. His inspirational posts cover everything from how many calories are in your favourite fast foods, to coffees to so-called super foods. Graeme makes it clear that nothing is off limits - from chocolate and ice-cream to bread and burgers - as long as you know how many calories they contain and adjust your diet to make sure youaposre in a deficit. He explained: People start looking at eating chocolate as bad butthey know itaposs  calories and they know what their calorie allowance is for that day and they know itaposs not great nutrition, they can eat something more nutritious later in the day. Graeme wonapost classy any food as bad for your but he does sadmit the protein rich foods will fill you up for longer and make you less likely to eat too much. These include lean meat, chicken or fish, eggs, beans and legumes and seeds and nuts. Exercise can also help burn extra calories and burn off what youaposve put into your body.

But itaposs more likely the festive season makes you extra-vigilant. Keeping an eye on how much they drink. Worrying what your loved ones will notice. Hiding the cost of things. Terried that now thereaposs witnesses.  Victims of domestic abuse are usually the last ones to realise it. You will probably tell people,it comes up, that someone who stays with their abuser is an idiot. You genuinely believe this, because you do not know much about it. Whether you are having your money taken, your liberty restricted, or your peace of mind destroyed, you are far too close to see it properly. You canapost get perspectiveyouaposre not at peace. Calls to police about domestic incidents spike at Christmas. The combination of alcohol, financial and family pressure, and being in close quarters adds to the pressure which you have got used to dealing with - like a temperamental, dysal cooker that will burn the roast,you donapost know the trick of how to close the door just so. You might think that knowing such tricks, spotting the problems early and moving quickly to deflect them, makes you a great chef. Actually what it means is youaposve got a knackered cooker.  A victim calls the police every  seconds for help. According to the Office of National Statistics, last year there were .m domestic abuse incidents and crimes recorded by police. Only  in every  such reports ever leads to an arrest. And the first time somebody asks for help is, on average, the th time something that is not normal has happened to them.They will not get effective help until it has happened  times.On average, victims live with their abuser for  or  years before they leave. Some for decades. Two thirds of them will try to leave  or  times in the year before they finally manage it. But not you. Because youaposve got this.  You are strong. You know how to fix it, and what sets it off. You know not to wear those clothes, not to talk about those things, not to ask that question. You know when to send the kids to your mumaposs, when to say sorry, when to go limp because thataposs the quickest way to make it end.You know itaposs normal to argue. You know itaposs normal for things to get a bit out of hand. Itaposs normal that someone with problems - perhaps drugs, or booze, issues at work or in their past - needs you to understand them better. They need YOUR help.Maybe the first time you said sorry it felt wrong, but it was the only way to make things calm again. Maybe you now think that youaposre always the one to blame. But you are strong, so you stay. Even though it is not normal to have to convince yourself to do that. It is not normal for blood to be spilled on bedsheets. Itaposs not normal for the neighbours to be so alarmed they call the police. Itaposs not a normal argument,you are down by one bedside lamp at the end of it and someoneaposs had to go to AE to get patched up. It IS entirely normal for the person responsible to tell you that itaposs fine, that you made them do it, thatonly you donapost do that again they wonapost get so angry, that you need to apologise to them and thataposs the only way to make up. It is normal for them to want, and expect, and need all the sympathy thataposs going.And itaposs entirely normal that you believe them. They use the same words and phrases our parents use, likeyou do that again... They play on the fact you love them. They tell you they love you, or perhaps theyaposve stopped telling you that, because it makes you work harder to hear it. It is normal that you bend. It is not normal that you break your spine doing it.  When was the last time you did not worry about what would happen at Christmas  When was the last time you worked, went out, had fun, flirted, relaxed, or laughed like you used to  When was the last time you talked about your relationship to someone , and didnapost lie about it  It is not normal to worry what the person who is supposed to love you will do next. It is not normal to hide the truth, wear clothes that cover it up, or pray the family donapost notice how afraid you are. You are right. Someone who can put up with all of this is very strong, and capable of deep and abiding love. It is the person doing it to you who is weak.  They are the one who feels something in their le is out of control - anything, from their age to their job to an addiction. Perhaps thereaposs an unexpected pregnancy, or a bereavement. But one way or another, they havenapost quite got a grip on things. So they hold on to you a bit tighter. At the start itaposs just a hug. But over time, you find it harder to breathe, to be you. You change, bend, accommodate, compromise, and every time you do they ask for more. Itaposs never enough. Something will always make them cross again, and you have to bend further. If youaposre lucky it will stop all by itself. Butitaposs not fixed itaposll come back. Do you really want to spend the next  years - hell,  minutes - waiting to seeit will happen again  Last year the police recorded  domestic homicides. Thataposs more than one person, every day, killed by someone they live with. One fth of people aged  to  have personal experience of domestic abuse. Itaposs horribly normal, what youaposre going through. But you are going through it. And itaposs possible to get out.

TV news presenters Hannah and Lewis Vaughan Jones spent years battling with infertility. But just before Christmas the pair announced the arrival of Matheson Calon Tallett Vaughan Jones - or Sonny for short - who they described as perfect in every way.Weaposve been through many years of heartache, but weaposve got the best Christmas present at the end of it all, said CNN news anchor Hannah, who gave birth to Sonny on December , Wales Online reports.We have been very public about it for the past three years or so, but in the years before that it was very private and painful - and there was a lot of shame involved which anyone going through infertility will be familiar with. But we have been lucky. We are the very, very lucky ones. Lewis, originally from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, said it was harrowing watching his we going through round after round of IVF which involved frequent injections and hormone treatment. We wanted a family, but frankly we didnapost think it was going to happen for us, said Lewis, a freelance news presenter for BBC News and ITV News. In fact, I think weaposd already emotionally moved on. We said to each other that this was going to be our last round [of IVF]. And it was the last little embryo that we had left. Weaposd sent it off for testing and the results came back inconclusive, so we didnapost think it was going to work at all.  But weaposd come this far, so we made the decision to put the embryo back in and, unbelievably, it grew to become Sonny. The couple, who live in Twickenham, said they spent around £, on private IVF treatment after being given one round for free with the NHS. They said the odds of having a baby were severely stacked against them. Weaposd been through so much disappointment and we were emotionally ready to move forward with our lives, said Hannah, . But when the pregnancy test came up as positive I really couldnapost believe it. We didnapost allow ourselves to get too excited in the first  weeks or so until weaposd had the viability scans.  There was huge, huge relief when they said the growth and development was fine. Hannah, who gave birth to Sonny via c-section weighing exactly lb, said there were a few dficult moments during his first few days of le. He lost a lot of weight in the first week which we panicked about. We already thought we were terrible parents and didnapost know how to keep this little human being alive. But heaposs now finally caught up to his birth weight.

Last December Becky Dell was inspired by the David Attenborough show Blue Planet to do her bit to help the environment. The Londoner decided to only buy food, drink and basic toiletries in . Writing on Twitter Becky said she watched, with shame plastic floating in the oceans and wondered how much was hers. So, aside from mascara and moisturiser, Becky did not buy anything she didnapost need. That meant no clothes, shoes, presents, other makeup, hair products, jewellery, bags, decorations, anything disposable, plants, flowers, house items etc. And the money that she saved from not splashing out would be given to a selection of charities and grassroots organisations. Becky says she ended up saving and donating £,.. But there were times when emergencies meant she had to buy something. On Twitter she said: I bought  things during the year, for example, a new jacket when my zip broke at - up a mountain, brr, a couple of essential things for my very elderly cats and a couple of essential house items. Each one made me really annoyed! And friends and family understood her challenge and supported Beckyaposs decision, with the thrty musical director making presents herself instead. And there were some things she really missed. Becky wrote: The thing I missed the most was buying plants and flowers, I love nature and found that hard. Solutions were growing flowers from seedand getting cuttings from friends . I now have rhubarb growing!!  At first, she said, it was quite easy: January to August was surprisingly easybut it got WAY hard from August, as clothes started running out and however much I darned my socks they just stayed holey. It got easier in December as I could start counting down. After  months of austere living the first thing Becky plans on splashing out on is socks, plants, some nice tea towels and a tea strainer.

Bulgarian born Baba Vanga has been dubbed the aposNostradamus of the Balkansapos for her predictions. Despite dying  years ago, those with a keen interest in mysticism continue to revere Babaaposs work, which some claim looks forward to  - the year she believed the universe will end. Right before her death at the age of  she made a series of predictions for the year . The most startling revelation is that Vladamir Putin and Donald Trumpaposs lives are in danger. The Russian president could reach the end of his mortal coil thanks to an assassination attempt made from within the Kremlin. Almost as dramatically, the US president will fall ill with a mysterious illness which will leave him deaf and with a brain tumour. Those with long memories may remember Baba foretold that Putin and Trumpaposs lives would be in danger last year, suggesting some kind of cosmic rollover.  Another recurrent theme in her predictions has been the destruction of Asia. Baba foresaw that “a big wave will cover the shore and people will disappear underwater” in what some interpreted as the destruction of Thailand by a huge tsunami in . The outlook in  is equally as bleak, with more tsunamis and earthquakes scheduled to hit the continent. A meteorite is also predicted to fall on Russia.  Perhaps the most ominous prediction of the clairvoyant was that the European continent could reach the end of its existence at the hands of Muslim extremists The Bulgarian suggested that extremists would use an arsenal of chemical weapons against Europeans”. Supporters of Baba are keen to emphasise how spot on she has been, with % accurate a phrase that regularly crops up in fan forums. According to baba-vanga, the figure is drawn from research conducted by Professor Georgi Lozanov - a former director of the Bulgarian Institute of Suggestology. Others point to her past successes as proof that she had foresight beyond that of a typical human.  In  she guessed that America would be hit by two apossteel birdsapos in a terror attack, in what was later interpreted as a reference to  . She said: Horror, horror! The American brothers will fall after being attacked by the steel birds. The wolves will be howling in a bush, and innocent blood will be gushing. Babaaposs big breakthrough had come a year earlier however, when she accurately predicted the sinking of Russian submarine the Kursk. Before cancelling Christmas and ordering a nuclear bunker however, readers should know that some questions remain around Baba and her predictions - some of which have been proved to be way off the mark.  Her prophecy that Europe would cease to exist by  was clearly wrong, unless seen through an incredibly generous Brexiteer lense. Babaaposs suggestion that the  FIFA World Cup final would be played between two teams beginning with the letter aposbapos was equally wrong. The nuclear war pencilled in for the years  to  also failed to materialise. Perhaps more damning is the seemingly non-existent nature of her prophecies. While Baba may have spoken or written down her predictions in Bulgarian, no credible version is available to view. According to a  Washington Post investigation, the few prophecies that can be traced back to their origins appear to come from Russian social media. When Bulgarian newspaper  Chasa interviewed Babaaposs neighbours, they said she had never predicted  , the sinking of the Kursk or the big war.

Katryn was abandoned when she had just given birth to a litter. The babies and their mother were taken to the Langebaan Animal Care, in Western Cape, South Africa, but unfortunately her offspring did not survive. The ginger tabby went into mourning and became reclusive, and spent most of the time crying. But things changed when four Border Collie cross puppies arrived at the shelter. Katryn, who was still lactating, immediately began licking the three-week-old pups. They instinctively began nursing on her, and she settled herself with them so they could have their feeds. The feline made her home sleeping next to the pups and began cleaning and protecting them. A representative from Langebaan Animal Care said: As soon as she met the puppies she settled.

Meanwhile hundreds of thousands of people watched a light and sound show in Paris and acrowd of around a million packed into New Yorkaposs Times Square. The cityaposs entry into  was marked by the annual fall of the Times Square Ball. The ball, which is illuminated by , lights, lit up the Manhattan night sky, along with fireworks set off in nearby Central Park. Click here to follow our live blog for the latest videos, photos and updates from New Yearaposs Eve celebrations around the world. Confetti filled Times Square as couples kissed and crowds screamed with joy as the decade came to an end. Dubai has also welcomed  with pyrotechnics, fireworks, lasers and wingsuit flyers. The cash-rich United Arab Emirates city has splashed out after a million people descended on Downtown. Celebrations have reached Europe as Moscow rings in  with fireworks in the Red Square at pm UK time. Russian President Vladimir Putin has given his address to the nation on New Year’s and.. it’s quite something. In it he speaks of “our ancestors – the heroic, unyielding generation of victors” and congratulates “everyone who went through the most dficult trials for the sake of us and for the future of our country. I bow low before you.” He ends by saying “Friends, the New Year is already knocking at the door. Let’s wish each other and our Motherland peace and prosperity.” London Mayor Sadiq Khan promised the “best fireworks London has ever seen” to ring in the new decade. Mr Khan said the capital would “project confidence” on the world stage through an impressive display at the New Year’s Eve celebrations. Speaking in the city centre ahead of the celebrations, Mr Khan told the PA news agency: “Hand on heart, these are going to be the best fireworks London has ever seen.” He added the “world” was watching the display and he hoped it would show London was a “global city”. Hong Kong welcomed  with neon-lit promenades - despite more massive rallies by protesters. Authorities there cancelled the main midnight fireworks display for the first time in a decade, citing security concerns. A Symphony of Lights took place instead, involving projections on the cityaposs tallest skyscrapers, while smaller-scale pyrotechnics were launched from waterfront rooftops. Spectacular firework displays have been enjoyed where though, including in Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and across both Koreas. In Indonesia, while fireworks erupted over Garuda Wisnu Kencana cultural park in Bali, torrential rains threatened to make the celebrations a wash out in the capital of Jakarta. But tens of thousands of revellers ploughed on. The island volcano of Anak Krakatau erupted earlier today, just as it did last year just before Christmas day, triggering a tsunami which killed hundreds of people. This dampened New Year events along Indonesia’s coastal areas near the Sunda Strait today. As in Hong Kong, thousands of Indians also planned to greet the new year with protests. They are angered by a citizenship law that they say will discriminate against Muslims and chip away at India’s secular constitution. Demonstrations were planned in New Delhi, in the grip of its second coldest winter in more than a century, as well as Mumbai and other cities. Nevertheless, the new year Jasn a Bhopal  in Bhopal India went off without a hitch. And Sydney welcomed  with a dazzling fireworks display as Australiaaposs New Yearaposs Eve celebrations took on a sombre tone amid the most devastating bush fire crisis ever.    More than a dozen people have been killed and towns have been ravaged as wildfires rage across much of the country. Sydneyaposs harbourfront was cloaked in smoke as hundreds of thousands of revellers gathered to watch a -minute fireworks show that went ahead despite calls for it to be scrapped. More than , people had signed an online petition urging the city to cancel the display out of respect and donate the money to the firefighting effort. High fire danger and extreme temperatures - western Sydney hit C on Tuesday - had led to the cancellation of several planned New Yearaposs fireworks displays, including in the national capital Canberra. But Sydney pressed ahead with its plans and was granted a fire ban exemption, while other cities had their applications rejected. Earlier on Tuesday, Sydney’s Lord Mayor Clover Moore defended the decision and delivered a scathing attack on the national government’s climate change record.  Scientists have said climate change is fuelling a longer and more intense bush fire season this summer. The mayor told reporters that much of the New Yearaposs event’s budget had already been spent and the celebration generates almost £million for the New South Wales economy. Signs set up around the harbour told people how to donate money to help those affected by fires. Bush fires are raging amid a drought and summer heatwave that has sent temperatures soaring above C in all of Australiaaposs states. The crisis worsened on Tuesday as two more people died, five others were missing and feared dead, and thousands were forced to flee to beaches in a wall of smoke under a blood-red sky to escape. Police said a father and son died in the early hours of Tuesday defending their home in Cobargo, near the coast in the state of New South Wales ,  miles south of Sydney. The town was hit by one out-of-control fire which roared into the community in the middle of the night, with its main street bearing the impact. Further south, fires continued to blaze out of control in the state of Victoria, where some , people were forced to take shelter on the beach in the holiday town of Mallacoota, in the East Gippsland district along the Pacic coast. Around , more people were sheltering in community centres in the town. Those sheltering on the beach were advised to go into the waterthe fire situation worsened. Similar advice was given to people in several NSW coastal towns, where fearful residents and holidaymakers had also abandoned their dwellings to move onto beaches. People in Mallacoota posted on social media about hearing the roar of the fire, circulating photos showing how, in the words of some, the smoke had turned the day into night. As defence force personnel assisted firefighters and volunteers in tackling some of the worst blazes, eight fires were burning at emergency level across NSW, with a similar number ongoing in Victoria, and two more in the island state of Tasmania.

Kim also said there were no grounds for North Korea to be bound any longer by a self-declared moratorium on testing nuclear bombs and intercontinental ballistic missiles . The moratorium was imposed following talks between Kim and Trump, but Pyongyang has since test-fired a number of short-range missiles into the sea and satellite images have suggested it has continued work on its nuclear programmes. The comments from North Koreaaposs leader were released by state media after he presided over a four-day meeting of top Workersapos Party officials amid rising tensions with the United States. Washington has not responded to his repeated calls for concessions to reopen negotiations. It has instead has dismissed the deadline as articial. At times smiling or striking the podium with his hand as he made remarks during the meeting, Kim accused the United States of gangster-like demands and maintaining a hostile policy, such as by holding continued joint military drills with South Korea, adopting cutting edge weapons and imposing sanctions.  He pledged to continue bolstering his countryaposs nuclear deterrent but said the scope and depth of that deterrent will be properly co-ordinated depending on the attitude of the US. He signalled there was still room for dialogue with the United States. The world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future, Kim said, using the initials for North Koreaaposs official name - the Democratic Peopleaposs Republic of Korea. He added: We will reliably put on constant alert the powerful nuclear deterrent capable of containing the nuclear threats from the US and guaranteeing our long-term security.  US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said it would be deeply disappointingKim reneges on denuclearisation commitments and Kim would hopefully choose peace and prosperity over conflict and war. In his latest comments on Tuesday in the United States, Trump said he had a good relationship with Kim and thought the North Korean leader would keep his word. The US president said: He likes me, I like him. We get along. Heaposs representing his country, Iaposm representing my country. We have to do what we have to do. But he did sign a contract, he did sign an agreement talking about denuclearisation.

just two years.Persecution of the iconic birds as well as changes in land use had led to numbers dropping across the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway in recent decades.Ahead of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project being launched almost two years ago it was believed that there were only two-to-four breeding pairs left across the whole area.Conservationists had identied enough habitat spread across the two rural local authority regions to comfortably cater for as many as  birds.Eaglets were taken from nests in the north of Scotland by ornithologists to prepare for release in the south.In early  five custom built aviaries were constructed in the Southern Upland hills to allow the first of the eaglets to become accustomed to the new territory.While the work of bringing a new generation of golden eagles to the Borders continued, outreach officers staged school and community visits to provide education on the endangered species.This month, with four eagles now successfully introduced to the south of Scotland, bosses at the project revealed that , people have now supported their work by either volunteering or taking part in the outreach sessions.Philip Munro, community outreach officer for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, told us: ldquoIt is fantastic to see so many people are so passionate about protecting this iconic species in the south of Scotland.\"We are absolutely delighted with the support, which plays an absolutely vital role in protecting golden eagles.\"We need to keep building on this so that we can ensure that we can see even more of these magnicent birds across the south of Scotlandrsquos skies for generations to come.Funded by Heritage Lottery and LEADER Scottish Borders and DG, the project aims to bring together all countryside users

south of Scotland and one in the Scottish Highlands, Borders College, the Scottish Raptor Study Group, Kielder Bird of Prey Centre, HMP Dumfries, and local businesses like Wild Tree Adventures.Earlier this year, the Philiphaugh Estate near Selkirk also announced that it plans to open a Golden Eagle Centre which will support the projectrsquos conservation and community engagement work.Francesca Osowska, Scottish Natural Heritagersquos chief executive, said: ldquoThis is a fantastic milestone.\"Golden eagles are such an amazing part of Scotlandrsquos bioersity, and an integral part of building a nature-rich country for us all.\"Wersquore passionate about ing golden eagles to places where they used to be plentul ndash and it looks like we have thousands of people on our side!\"A huge thank you to all the wonderful volunteers and project participants.The first four birds which were moved to the area have settled into their new habitats and are now fending for themselves.Support from volunteers and participants plays a pivotal role in helping the iconic species continue to grow and thrive in the area.One volunteer was shortlisted as Student of the Year by the Scottish Rural College, largely for her work on the project.Charlotte Martin, a Countryside Management student at SRUC, first heard about the Project when Philip Munro delivered a talk at the college.She said: ldquoHaving previously worked in areas where golden eagles were part of the fabric of the area and very much accepted and admired, alongside my career in farming with employers who farmed commercially yet with great respect for wildle, I was very excited by the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos aims.\"I badgered the project team to let me volunteer and have since been helping at public engagement events, which I thoroughly enjoy.As well as colleges, the outreach team have also visited many schools across the Borders.Michelle Hoppeacute, principal teacher for Yarrow

It is a scary premonition.ldquoYoursquore just getting old, was a recent diagnosis from a family member! It was said with affection, of course, yet the ring of truth gave it an unhelpful sting. Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you.

One business owner accused the local authority of trying to ide and confuse people so they did not attend.It comes after the council:Haddington Business Community Partnership had asked the council to postpone the public consultation until the start of the new year because it believes the local authority has breached Scottish Government guidelines stating that consultation exercises should not be launched during local or national election periods.A spokesperson for the council has denied this is the case and insisted it is a normal part of pre-consultation process.Community councillor Pat Lemmon said the decisions of the council were disappointing.She said: ldquoIt does not encourage feelings of trust for everyone working together. The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests.

It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the

had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application.

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration. Whatever your faith or spirituality, whatever your family or cultural traditions, I wish you a Happy New Year and I look forward to theof the sun, and sharing with you new adventures of discovery in our beautul county."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-youngsters-thank-lifeboat-crew-saving-lives","story":"Rachel Pirie and Luke Foster, both , were exploring the townrsquos clfs with Chloe McCaw, , at about noon on November  last year when the incident happened.The rising water levels left the youngsters, who all live in Dunbar and attend Dunbar Grammar School, cut off with no food, no water and one working mobile phone that did not have any credit.Police and Coastguard crews struggled to locate them.Talking about their ordeal, Rachel said: ldquoWe know the area well and the tide was well out so we thought we were safe.

The Kidney Flowers - Small FingersThis is a stomping, trashy, punky, rfing cracker that has been rehashed from an old self-released EP and sounds like a mighty collision of the Pixies, The Fall, The Walkmen and the Wedding Present in one blistering cut from the stunning debut album from the three-piece Glasgow musically primitive fast food enthusiasts who just might be my new favourite garage combo. Watch out Idles. Lewis Capaldi - Someone You LovedWhoever broke the Bathgate crooners Heart has made him millions. A number one single across the world from that the guy next door whose music has no bearing on his crazy social media appearances. Blanck Mass - House vs HouseA scream and a percussive rapid-fire vocal sample ushers in this eight-minute house-tinged synth epic and first single from the cracking fourth album of Benjamin John Power, who is also half of electro noise duo F*ck Buttons. The Edinburgh-based electro fiend topped this list last year with Odd Scene.TNGHT - SerpentHot Glasgow producer Hudson Mohawkes and Canadian producer Lunice make a welcome comeback after helping to usher in trap seven years ago, to produce this bone-shudderingly spiralling pulp of warped bass and percussion topped off with what sounds like an native American war cry.

The newcomer managed to sell out the legendary King Tuts Wah Wah Hut without having released any music at all online, a feat previously accomplished by Lewis Capaldi. Steve Mason - RocketThe best compliment you could pay this soaring standout about love, depression, disappointment and ultimately hope from the fourth solo album by the former front man of The Beta Band is it is the kind of dramatic epic that would not sound out of place on his previous bands acclaimed Three EPs.

Hideo Kojima, the game creator, said: \"You can cry just by listening to this song.\" Its not just hype. Anna Meredith - Inhale ExhaleLondon-born and Edinburgh-bred composer, performer and producer gave her twist on Vivaldis Four Seasons last year, only to show this year she can create a wonderfully hypnotic synth-pop song and sing on what is an instant highlight from her mercurial FIBS album.The song is underpinned with lyrics exploring a more sinister and pessimistic take on what lsquolivingrsquo or having a lsquowild timersquo might be like for \"a cautious person like myself\".She sings:\"You say yoursquore dancing in the deep end, but to me it looks like drowning\". C Duncan - Talk Talk TalkThe sublime opening track from the third album from the Glasgow musician and the first away from his bedroom studio, also moved him away from his introspective art pop on this, into synth pop gem territory. But typical of the Scot who received a Mercury Prize nomination for his debut album Architect, it remains sounding like nothing  around, with signature layered harmonies and a gorgeous hooksome middle eight.ldquoTalk Talk Talk is about miscommunication. Itrsquos about not realising that yoursquore actually on the same page as someone and how a misperception can drive you apart. However, itrsquos also about realising this and rebuilding bridges,\" Duncan says. Wuh Oh - Pretty Boy Glasgow-producer Wuh Oh, aka Peter Ferguson teams up with Hudson Mohawke for a mindblowingly original classical meets post-electro music with cellos and xylophones thrown in for good measure.\"One day something in my brain exploded and it was asI could suddenly see what made the chord progressions and melodies work. I got mega obsessed with harmony and since then Irsquove never stopped searching for magic note combinations I donrsquot understand yet: those greeny-purple chords,\" Ferguson says. Goodnight Louisa - Hollow GodldquoBettys got her head in the oven again.\" So starts this spinetingling, highly charged, emotionally dark but hopeful cinematic-pop debut single from Louise McCraw who fronted the underrated Edinburgh band Skjoslashr.It is dedicated to a little boy in the accompanying video, her uncle, Michael. He died ten years after the footage was shot as the result of a tragic car accident. \"I drew a lot of inspiration from Michael to write this song, that no matter when we think weve lost someone, they still live within us, in the curve of an eye, through theof a nose, through our mannerisms, we will carry them forever,\" she says.Top  Tunes from Scotland in  Part  Top  Tunes from Scotland in  Part  Top  Tunes from Scotland in  Part  This is the Spoty playlist.This is the YouTube playlist."},{"url":null,"title":"people-decade-20-movers-shakers-history-makers","story":"In , Time Magazine named its person of the year as \"the silence breakers\". McGowan was just one of those many women who stepped forward to make accusations about Harvey Weinstein that year. She was there at the beginning of a series or revelations about the producer which would snowball into a global sharing of stories of womens experience of sexual assault and harassment that would be called #MeToo.If anyone became a figurehead, it was McGowan. She may not have come up with the term Me Too ndash that was Tarana Burke back in . Nor was she the person to put the hashtag out into the ocean of social media ndash that was Alyssa Milano, her co-star from Charmed. But she made her mark as someone who would not be silenced. She has also claimed that she was the first person to out Weinstein.#MeToo was a cultural revolution and catharsis. Back in , when it broke, it felt asHollywood and the many fields where men were protected by their power and influence would never be the same again. In this revolution around what women should tolerate, who would be listened to, and what should be shamed, McGowan stood out. She wrote a memoir, Brave. She used her anger as a weapon. In an interview with the Times, she asked, \"Who has been more effective  hellip Playing nice for women hasnt got us very far.\"Weinstein recently complained that he was \"a forgotten man\". With his trial coming up next month ndash five charges, including two counts of rape ndash he might wish he were more forgotten than he is. #MeToo might have experienced backlash and criticism. But out of it did come much that was positive and inspirational, particularly the courage of the women who came forward. McGowan embodies that. Her voice carried the message that the time when abusers could expect silence was over.VICKY ALLANPHOEBE WALLER-BRIDGE, ACTOR, WRITER AND PRODUCERSpeaking to The Herald recently, Scottish actress Ellie Haddington recalled her time working on The Cafe, a Sky One sitcom which aired in . It starred The Royle Familys Ralf Little alongside Haddington and Littles co-writer Michelle Terry. But it was another cast member, then an unknown -year-old actress, who particularly caught Haddingtons eye. \"I can remember looking at her,\" she said, \"and thinking: My God, what an extraordinary inidual.\" The inidual in question was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, in her first major role.Fast forward eight years and the London-born polymath has the world at her feet, particularly the part that houses the gilded constituencies that hand out Emmys and Golden Globes. The  Golden Globe ceremony is on January  in Beverly Hills and Waller-Bridge is up for two awards. Ten days later shell be honoured at the Screen Actors Guild Awards where shes nominated in two categories. Andshe flies home laden with mantelpiece accessories it wont be the first time ndash she scooped three Golden Globes at last years award as well as three Primetime Emmys.If not, well theres the not insignicant matter of the th James Bond film, No Time to Die, to be released in April. Waller-Bridge co-wrote the script and great things are expected. Of coursetheres one production on which Waller-Bridges name is indelibly stamped its Fleabag, written by and starring her as a young Londoner navigating family, work, sex and relationships with brutal honesty and unsettling humour.Starting out as a one-woman show at the Edinburgh Fringe, it was turned into a TV series in  but was dropped quietly onto BBC Three, then only available online. But word-of-mouth is still a powerful tool even in our digital age and by the summer it had been relaunched on BBC Four. The rest is television history: when we look back at this decades television, well be splitting it into pre and post-Fleabag.Even more interestingly, Waller-Bridge followed that triumph with one of the career curve-balls weve now come to expect: an adaptation of Luke Jenningss Villanelle spy novel series. Retitled Killing Eve it was fresh, funny, thrillingly violent and gratuitously fashion-forward, and made a star of lead actress Jodie Comer, whose pink Molly Godard tulle dress became the go-to Halloween costume for hipsters everywhere. And, of course, it hauled in yet more gongs for its writer.:Books of the decade: From Harper Lee and Hilary Mantel to EL JamesWill it be third time lucky with No Time to Die  Dont ever bet against Phoebe Waller-Bridge.BARRY DIDCOCKANDY MURRAY, TENNIS PLAYERSmall, wet, overweight countries should not ndash and usually do not ndash produce tennis superstars. As only those from other small countries can appreciate ndash the Jamaicans and Swiss, perhaps ndash possessing a global sports hero somehow makes your whole nation stand a little taller.Thats exactly what Andy Murray has done for Scotland . Is there any feeling comparable to the buzz of watching Murray play a big match, willing him to win with every demented fibre of your mind and body  I think not.And yet the Dunblane-born champion is not only from Scotland, but very much of his homeland. During the late Noughties, the young, gangly, wild-haired Murray thrilled us with his impressive Wimbledon runs. But as the years went on and he just missed out on a slew of grand slam trophies, many English media outlets and tennis fans took against him, decrying the sweary intensity and dry Scottish banter. This only made Scots love him more, of course.Eventually, with patience, maturity, courage and sheer hard graft came the top honours in tennis ndash the US Open, two Wimbledon singles titles, two Olympic gold medals, the Davis Cup, the coveted world number one spot ndash and global adulation.But as much as he grew as a sportsman, whats equally remarkable about Murray is how he grew as person. Indeed, it is his openness, humanity and humility, the way he speaks out against sexism in tennis, that make him a true hero, loved by his peers and the public, rather than simply respected.A devastating hip injury ndash and subsequent resurfacing operation ndash nearly ended Murrays career, and his recent comeback has been both painful and inspiring to watch.Murray taught Scots to dream big. But the father of three also taught Scots men, in particular, showing your feelings, being true to yourself, makes you a bigger man in every way.MARIANNE TAYLORJEFF BEZOS, AMAZON CEOThe worlds richest man is fond of reminding people that he started Amazon in his garage. A company that is now worth more than pound trillion and employs in the region of , people began with Bezos packing books and taking them to the post office himself.Like Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg and Twitters Jack Dorsey, Bezos grasped early on the potential of the internet. That realisation has had huge consequences. Amazon has transformed shopping, helped hollow out the high street, and led to a fortune for its creator estimated at poundbn.That has allowed him to set up his own space exploration company and buy the Washington Post .Bezoss success cant be gainsayed, but at what cost  Employees have bitterly complained about working conditions, the EU is investigating the company for anti-trust violations and earlier this year it had to scrap plans to build a second headquarters in New York when local politicians questioned why a company making bna month should receive taxpayers cash to move to the city.Oh yes, and it was also revealed that the company had not paid any income tax in the US the previous year. Or the year before that. You dont get to be the richest man in the world by giving anything away, obviously.TEDDY JAMIESONDAVID BOWIE, MUSICIANIn the months after his death at the start of , as Britain voted for Brexit and America voted for Donald Trump, there was a spate of tweets wonderingBowies absence was now one of the reasons why everything was going to hell in a handcart.\"Im not saying that David Bowie was holding the fabric of the universe together, but *gestures broadly at everything*\" tweeted blogger Katie Liewy with tongue firmly in cheek in June that year.Whether his influence actually stretched that far, theres no doubt that culturally this decade was Bowies, in the same way as the s belonged to the Beatles. As Oasis looked to Lennon and McCartney in the mid-s, Bowie became the touchstone for any musician ndash from FKA Twigs to St Vincent ndash in the s who wanted to push the odd boundary.But none of them did it as well as the original, who ed at the start of , after almost a decade in which he had withdrawn from public view. He released a new single, Where Are We Now , on his birthday without any warning. It presaged a new album, The Next Day, and a VA retrospective, David Bowie Is. Three years later he released an album, Blackstar, on his th birthday. Two days later his death was announced. It was ashe was curating his own end.:From the death of Bowie to the rise of grime: The decade in pop musicFor anyone who knew him in the middle of the s the fact that Bowie avoided being a rock n roll casualty must have seemed a miracle given his copious drug intake back then.Instead, he weaned himself off them, created some of the most memorable and potent music of the late th century, reinvented himself as a mainstream pop star in the s, then became an elder statesman who embraced everything from drum n bass to the internet before his final st-century flourish.His is one of the great stories in pop and in  it came to a tragic yet magnicent conclusion.TEDDY JAMIESONELON MUSK, TECHNOLOGY ENTREPRENEURThe chronicles of self-styled maverick billionaire Elon Musk never fail to fascinate. Among his outlandish adventures and madcap musings, we have Elon and the space car Elon and the Thai cave rescue Elon and the dead gorilla novelty rap Elon and his plan to nuke Mars.South African-born Musk first pricked the public consciousness as a technology entrepreneur, investor and engineer in  when, aged , he sold his web software company, Zip, to Compaq for  million .He continued to ascend his field throughout the Noughties, but it is in the last decade that Musk has become a household name for his roles as founder chief engineer designer of SpaceX and the CEO product architect at Tesla.Granted, this is often more down to calamity than plaudits for his innovative work. Such as the cringe-inducing moment during a recent unveiling for the new Tesla Cybertruck when, demonstrating how tough the \"armour glass\" of the windows was to break, they were duly smashed.Or when he referred to British er Vernon Unsworth ndash who helped rescue  Thai boys trapped in a flooded underwater cave in  ndash as \"pedo guy\" on Twitter .Then theres Musks lofty plans to \"nuke Mars\" ndash which he describes as \"a fixer upper of a planet\" ndash suggesting that nuclear bombs should be detonated at its poles to melt the ice caps and allow it to sufficiently heat up for humans to dwell there.And the head-scratching moment when he dropped a track on SoundCloud called RIP Harambe, a heavily auto-tuned song about the Cincinnati Zoo gorilla whose death in  sparked a global outpouring of grief and anger.Sure, Musk sometimes loses credibility due to his more leftfield thinking ndash such as a belief that were all probably living in a giant computer simulation like The Matrix or a Sims-style game controlled by superior beings ndash but there is no denying that hes a clever guy who shouldnt be underestimated.If this is a simulation, we cant wait to see what our overlords get him to do next.SUSAN SWARBRICKMEGHAN MARKLE, DUCHESS OF SUSSEXSurely it wasnt meant to be like this. If you become a fairy tale princess can you not then expect to live happily ever after That hasnt been the case for Meghan Markle. Yes, she had the royal wedding last year attended by the great and the good and the merely famous. Yes, she got a title, a handsome prince and a royal baby . Not what she must have expected growing up a mixed-race kid in Los Angeles.And yet since the wedding there has found herself a constant target of the tabloid press. She recently filed a lawsuit against the Mail on Sunday for publishing a private letter to her estranged father. It also prompted her husband Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, to condemn the medias \"relentless propaganda\" which was, he said, often \"knowingly  and malicious\" in a public statement announcing the legal action.His anger is perhaps understandable given the paparazzis involvement in the death of his mother. \"Every single time I see a camera, every single time I hear a click, every single time I see a flash, it takes me straight back,\" he admitted this year.The Duchess of Sussexs major crime would appear to be that she has \"opinions\". There is a class of media commentator ndash mouthy, reactionary and perhaps most importantly white ndash who is offended by her feminism and likes to moan about the couples \"wokeness\". It has prompted \"the Queen\", or, rather, the TV version of the monarch, Olivia Colman, star of The Crown, to speak out against the critics.:From Leonard Bernsteinrsquos MASS to the GRIT Orchestra, Keith Bruces musical picks of the decade\"I dont know why theyre so mean to a fellow human being,\" Coleman said of the press coverage.Or maybe we simply have to accept there is no such thing as happy ever after.TEDDY JAMIESONGRETA THUNBERG, ENVIRONMENTAL CAMPAIGNER\"My name is Greta,\" a Swedish schoolgirl wrote on her flyers in . \"I am in ninth grade, and I am school-striking for the climate. Since you adults dont give a damn about my future, I wont either.\"Its hard to believe that it has only been just over a year since Thunberg ndash recognised now simply as \"Greta\" to millions ndash made her viral UN speech in Poland, saying, \"You say you love your children above all . And yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes.\"Thunberg may only have made her stamp in the final year of the decade, but at just  years old she has done more to provoke an attitude sht on environment than anyone, and she began it by skipping school.Her words and actions have woken millions of schoolchildren, four million of whom went on strike from school on September , as well as adults, to the science-backed threat of the climate emergency. On what is arguably the biggest issue of our time, hers is the voice that has led, upbraiding those in leadership. Margaret Atwood called her the Joan of Arc of environmentalism. Donald Trump told her to \"chill\". Collins Dictionary made \"climate strike\" its word of the year.Why did people listen to her, when others saying the same were ignored  Perhaps because of who she was ndash not an adult, scientist, politician or expert ndash and how she, a teenager with Aspergers Syndrome, delivered her message, politely, yet angrily and without softenings.To the UN General Assembly, in September, she said: \"We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you.\" She has started a powerful movement. The question is whether necessary change will follow.

It was the decisive first step on a journey that would transform not only the young Sturgeon but the fortunes of her party, and, ultimately, the political landscape in Scotland.After becoming an MSP in , Sturgeon, a solicitor by trade, impressed from the outset, serving in two shadow cabinets. In , she was elected deputy party leader to Alex Salmond during his second stint as party leader. The partnership was successful and in  the SNP won a majority at Holyrood, paving the way for s independence referendum.When Salmond resigned as SNP leader and First Minister in the aftermath of the Yes campaigns loss, Sturgeon was the obvious choice to replace him.:From Frozen to  Years a Slave, the best films of the last  yearsThe five years since have seen tumultuous change in UK politics, with Sturgeon growing in stature as politician and stateswoman, both in UK and European terms, even in the eyes of many who do not share her stance on independence. She regularly appears in glossy magazine lists of the worlds most influential women.During the recent General Election campaign her clear opposition to Brexit and impressive performances in TV debates ndash not to mention her lively Twitter feed ndash won her a whole new legion of fans in England, particularly among women. Will Sturgeon lead Scotland to independence in the s  That remains to be seen. Regardless, her place in Scottish history, as politician and role model, is guaranteed.MARIANNE TAYLORBARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATESThings might look dferent now. In , at the end of Barack Obamas second term in office, when commentators looked back at his legacy as president, there was a sense that his achievements were, at best, mixed.True, he had withdrawn US soldiers from Iraq, improved relations with Cuba, reached a nuclear deal with Iran and introduced Obamacare.Set against that, though, he escalated American military involvement in Afghanistan, increased drone strikes in Pakistan, saw wealth and income inequality rocket under his watch. Guantanamo Bay was still in operation when he left office and though he spoke out in favour of gun control he didnt manage to introduce it.Obama could point to Republican obstruction in the House of Congress. Even so there was a whf of missed opportunities about his presidency. Perhaps that was inevitable. In the end a centrist president was never going to live up to the utopian notions so many Americans projected on to him during the  election campaign.And yet, in retrospect, perhaps his achievements are growing. What has been missed over the last four years is his articulacy, eloquence, wit and normality.In part its because he represents the antithesis of what came after. An inarticulate, narcissistic, racist, corrupt old man whose first term has been a skip fire of the vanities ending in a vote for impeachment. Obama for all his failings always felt like he was an adult in the room. Can you say the same of Donald Trump TEDDY JAMIESONKIM KARDASHIAN WEST, REALITY TV STAR AND ENTREPRENEURLove her or loathe her, there is no denying that Kim Kardashian West ripped up the rule book in her rise to becoming a world-famous reality star with a multi-million-dollar business empire and a global fanbase.Having first found peripheral fame as a friend and stylist to heiress Paris Hilton in the early s, Kardashian West gained notoriety after the release of her sex tape with then-boyfriend Ray J in . That same year, the familys reality TV series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, began airing.While the naysayers reckoned it would be a fleeting  minutes of fame, Kardashian West pulled off a shrewd and unparalleled move: she utilised social media to make herself into a brand. Today, her Midas touch extends across fashion, fragrances and cosmetics to television, books, gaming, and even law and politics. Oh, and she is queen of the selfie.An exaggerated hourglass figure and cartoonishly large backside have become a trademark for Kardashian West, garnering as many ndash and often more ndash column inches as her entrepreneurial ventures.: The best visual arts of the last  years, by Jan Patience and Sarah Urwin JonesIndeed, when Kardashian West posed for a  cover of Paper magazine with her rear bared and oiled up like a Greek wrestler, it saw a new phrase \"break the internet\" coined, referring to the frenzy that the images sparked.That same year, she joined her husband, the rapper Kanye West, for a landmark cover on Vogue magazine. \"There are a lot of firsts,\" Kardashian West said at the time. \"Kanyes the first rapper to be on, Im the first reality person to be on, were the first interracial couple.\"She continues to surprise people. Earlier this year, Kardashian West announced she was following in her late fathers footsteps by studying to become a lawyer .Kardashian West ndash who boasts  million social media followers on Instagram alone ndash seems determined to use her  and stratospheric public profilefor good, visiting US president Donald Trump at the Oval Office last year to discuss justice reform.She successfully lobbied Trump to grant clemency to Alice Johnson, a -year-old woman who spent  years in an Alabama prison, without parole, for a non-violent, first-time drug offence. Johnson was released in  and Kardashian West has vowed to tackle other miscarriage of justices.Her work to date makes for impressive reading. But in the scheme of things, one could argue that Kardashian West is only just getting started. With her husband having announced he intends to run for US president in , a decade from now this might all seem like small fry.SUSAN SWARBRICKSTORMZY, RAPPERWhy is Stormzy one of the most influential public figures of the last decade  There are  people you could ask ndash  black students who were admitted to Cambridge University in . Thats up about  per cent more than the  who started courses in .Not all of it is down to Stormzy, but a lot of it may be. In , the grime artist announced he would be paying the tuition fees and maintenance grants of two black Cambridge students, and this year he said hed be paying for two more. Its called the Stormzy Scholarship and now theyre calling the rise in the number of black students at Cambridge the Stormzy Effect.The question is: can the effect spread  Theres still a huge gap between the chances of going to university in the UKyoure white and well-off and the chances of goingyoure black or youre poor or youre both and some argue universities will have to offer places to poorer students with lower grades to start making a dference. But the good news, thanks to Stormzy, is that black students now make up more than three per cent of new undergrads at Cambridge for the first time.Stormzy has had another effect too, and perhaps its one that will be even more profound. Rappers have traditionally had a bit of an image problem: theyve usually promoted out-of-school activities rather than in-school ones. But Stormzys dferent. \"It sounds corny coming from a rapper,\" he says, \"but I did love learning and I loved studying.\" The Stormzy Effect could inspire many others to feel the same.MARK SMITHSIMONE BILES, GYMNASTOnce in a letime ndashyoure very lucky ndash theres a sporting star who shines so brightly that they eclipse everything that has come before.Step forward Simone Biles. The US gymnasts talent and achievements are such that we humble observers have long since exhausted the superlatives.While the gymternet ndash as the online community of gymnastics fans are known ndash has been abuzz about Biles for years, it was at the Rio  Olympic Games that the rest of the world sat up and took notice.: From Our Ladies of Perpetual Succour to What Girls Are Made of, five standout theatre shows of the decadeBiles, who won four golds and a bronze, found herself repeatedly compared to a raft of male sporting greats asthat is the only way we could comprehend her colossal achievements. \"Im not the next Usain Bolt or Michael Phelps,\" she responded. \"Im the first Simone Biles.\"The -year-old from Texas burst onto the global gymnastics scene in , winning her debut world all-around gold in Antwerp. It is a title that Biles has claimed on four further occasions , alongside a raft of inidual apparatus medals.In October, Biles took her th medal, making her the most decorated gymnast ndash male or female ndash in world championship history .But it is not only in a competition arena that Biles proved herself a gargantuan presence. In January , she released a statement on Twitter confirming that former USA Gymnastics physician Larry Nassar had sexually assaulted her under the guise of medical treatment.Nassar was later sentenced to up to  years in prison after more than  women stood up in court and laid bare their own experiences of sexual abuse in a scandal spanning three decades.Biles and her fellow survivors were awarded the Arthur Ashe Courage Award. At the  US National Championships, she designed and wore a teal leotard ndash a colour used to raise awareness about sexual abuse.A vocal critic of the US Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics for their response to the allegations against Nassar, Biles continues to lobby for better accountability from both governing bodies.She refuses to be defined by what happened. Biless willingness to push the boundaries of her sport remains unabated. At the  US Gymnastics Championships, she stepped out in a crystal-studded leotard bearing her surname above an embroidered image of a goats head.It was a nod to the acronym GOAT, which is shorthand for the Greatest of All Time. Far from being boastful, however, this was Biless tongue-in-cheek \"jab back\" at the \"haters\" .She has the goods to back it up. This year Biles had two gymnastics skills ndash a hugely dficult triple twisting-double somersault in her floor routine and double-double dismount from beam ndash named in her honour after she became the first woman to perform them. Both appear to defy gravity.The Tokyo  Olympic Games loom on the horizon. Simone Biles is far from done yet.SUSAN SWARBRICKABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADIHe was the most wanted terrorist in the world. For more than half of the last decade, no single figure caused more chaos in the Middle East than Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim al-Badri. For that was his real name, even though the world came to know him by his nom de guerre, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.As the decade began al-Baghdadi had already served four years in the sprawling US military detention centre called Camp Bucca, which had detained some of the Iraq Wars most radical jihadists. In political and religious terms he was already a long way from his days as a PhD student of Islamic Studies at university in Baghdad.By , clad in black robes and standing in the pulpit of a mosque in Iraqs second city of Mosul, he was already claiming the title caliph of the Muslim world and leadership of the infamous Islamic Stategroup.Few even then could have imagined the chaos, carnage and suffering that al -Baghdadi, born one of six children in , would wreak on the world.:Books of the decade: From Harper Lee and Hilary Mantel to EL JamesIt would not be until October , , in a raid carried out by US Special Forces, when al-Baghdadi detonated a suicide vest in the Syrian province of Idlib, that the world was rid of his malign presence.\"We killed the last murderous bastard who ran IS, lets go get the next one,\" proclaimed one tough-talking US Republican Senator in the wake of al- Baghdadis death.But in the tunnels and booby traps left behind in cities like Mosul and Raqqa to the mass graves and thousands of faceless, black-clad female followers haunting refugee camps, ISs presence remains palpable along with its new new leader, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi.Many IS fighters now languish in prisons, but thousands more remain at large re-grouping and organising while their franchises likewise operate across the globe. This is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadis lingering and still menacing legacy.DAVID PRATT, CONTRIBUTING FOREIGN EDITORBOB SERVANT, BURGER TYCOONAh, Bob Servant. How do we love thee  Let us count the ways.

Public opinion has become ever more supportive. LGBT people have become ever more visible. And in , gay marriage was made legal in most of the UK.Then theres the T in LGBT. A few days ago, the Scottish Government published a draft bill which will simply the process of trans men and women having their gender legally recognised, but its not been an easy path. Some feminists say the legislation will undermine the rights of women. Trans activists say a change in the law is the only way to end the demeaning legal and medical process trans people currently have to endure. The two sides have not always been nice to each other.What the debate, and the bitterness, may prove is there is still some distance to go to LGBT equality, but the fact we got closer in the last decade is in large part due to its trans pioneers and one pioneer in particular. You know what Im talking about andnot, you should: the cover of Vanity Fair in June . Caitlyn Jenner. Former Olympic athlete. Openly transgender woman.For Jenner, the photograph was an act of happiness. \"Im so happy after such a long struggle to be living my true self,\" she said when the magazine was published. \"Welcome to the world Caitlyn.\" And for those who saw the picture, it was an act of courage and activism. When is equality  When trans people are in parliaments, and in churches, and in governments, and on the cover of fashion magazines.MARK SMITHDONALD TRUMP, BORIS JOHNSON, NIGEL FARAGE AND VLADIMIR PUTIN, POPULIST POLITICIANSVladimir Putin is about to mark  years in power ndash he first became Russian president on December ,  ndash and for much of that time the West has looked at his style ndash authoritarian, bombastic and a little bit silly ndash and thought: thank God were not like that.But that was then. First, a man with a fag in his mouth ndash call me Nigel ndash became leader of Ukip and the Brexit Party. Then a man with a phone in his hand ndash call me Donald ndash became president of the United States. And then a man with an inappropriate phrase on the tip of his tongue ndash call me Boris ndash became Prime Minister of the UK.Its not a coincidence they are known by their Christian names. Nigel, Donald and Boris represent a new, first-names-only style of politics that has dominated America and the UK in the last  years: populist, chummy, big on rhetoric, light on detail, and ndash much to the frustration of liberals ndash effective at attracting votes. Those three men have attracted support from working class voters who have traditionally looked to the left for answers. In the last  years, though, theyve looked right, and the result is Nigel, Donald and Boris.The next decade will decide their fate. Arguably, Farage has already been neutered after the Brexit Partys dismal election campaign. But the fates of Trump and Johnson are less certain. Trump has been impeached and will face a trial in the Senate, but its controlled by the Republicans, who arent going to vote their man out. As for Johnson, hes just won a big, blue majority and, failing a cock-uphes going to be here for the next five years.Beware:  years of populism may become .MARK SMITHPROFESSOR PETER HIGGS, SCIENTISTScience always plays the long game. It took almost a century for scientists in  to prove Einsteins  predictions of gravitational waves in space, which formed part of his theory of general relativity. Professor Peter Higgs didnt have to wait quite that long.Back in , while teaching at Edinburgh University, Higgs published papers predicting the existence of a particle that gave mass to the most basic building blocks of matter. It soon became known as the Higgs Boson. Much to his dismay, it was also called the God particle.No-one could find it, however. Or not until , when the large hadron collider near Geneva finally proved its existence.A year later Higgs, then , won the Nobel Prize in Physics, sharing the prize with fellow scientist Francois Englert.Higgs decided to go on holiday when the prize was announced, neglecting to take his mobile phone with him in a bid to avoid being pestered by journalists.

Kids shouting to one another and woman up on the stage with an old piano.\"You didnt know the time - there was no children with a watch.

Thirty years after it was named the first European City of Culture, it has in recent times hosted the Commonwealth Games and the BBC Six Music Festival as well as lining up alongside Berlin to stage the  European Championships. In the year ahead it, just like global cities including Amsterdam, Copenhagen, London and Rome, will host a number of matches for UEFArsquos European Football Championship and will also welcome world leaders to COP , a global climate change summit.Not bad for a city that in  was seen as so scarred by poverty, infirmity and other vestiges of its industrial past that even its own citizens questioned the rationale for choosing it over practically anywhere  as a European cultural capital.The transformation has not come easy, though. A city does not attract high-profile events in a bubble and major businesses like Barclays, which is currently building a hub on the banks of the Clyde, do not choose to create thousands of jobs in a place without discussion. Everything that has happened to Glasgow in the past three decades has happened because of the considerable effort put in by its political leaders as well as representatives of its and Scotlandrsquos business, sporting and cultural communities. They might have spent a bit of public money attending meetings, making contacts and preparing bids - they might even have spent a lot - but considering what the city has got insurely we can all agree it has been money well spent Well, no. Because faced with evidence of the seemingly profligate spending of Glasgow City Councilrsquos deputy leader David McDonald, representatives of opposition parties have declared themselves up in arms. The problem is that in addition to visiting schools, housing developments and local museums, Mr McDonald went on a number of publicly funded trips this year, with visits to Tokyo, Tallinn and Duumlsseldorf among them.Tokyo was to attend the opening of an exhibition of  works from Glasgowrsquos publicly owned Burrell Collection Tallinn was to rub shoulders with other civic leaders at the Estonian national song festival, an event Mr McDonald had been invited to as a representative of a UNESCO City of Music and Duumlsseldorf was to take part in an international summit on social cohesiveness on the invitation of the mayor of Montreal.Yet despite Glasgow working so hard to earn its emerging status as a global city - and despite the obvious advantages attending such events can bring - these were seen as beyond the pale. Conservative MSP Annie Wells reckoned Glaswegians ldquowill be understandably annoyed that an SNP councillor is spending so much of their money on this truly international class of junketing Gary Smith, Scottish secretary of staunch Labour-supporting union the GMB, agreed. ldquoGlasgow council-tax payers will be aghast at this councillorrsquos excesses, he fumed. ldquoThe cityrsquos infrastructure is decrepit, the streets are dirty and there are budget cuts affecting the elderly and vulnerable.Gary Smith does, of course, have a point. Like every other local authority in the country Glasgow City Council has been struggling with budgetary constraints whose effects are plain for all to see. Walk down any street and the filth is astonishing, with the absence of blocked drains, overflowing bins and dog dirt more remarkable than their presence. At the same time, the council is failing so miserably to meet its obligations to house everyone presenting as homeless that it has been placed under review by the Scottish Government, threatened with legal action by homelessness charity Shelter and been made the subject of an inquiry by the Scottish Housing Regulator. The city has its problems, alright, and then some.Yet damning as those and many other issues are, none of that will be solved by the city turning in on itself. Far from this being the time for Glasgowrsquos leaders to hunker down and worry solely about how to cope with shrinking budgets, this is precisely the moment the city should be selling itself on the global stage, using the confidence it has gained over the past  years to attract the kind of investment that will at least give it the opportunity to thrive.To suggest that politicians like Mr McDonald should snub invitations to build international links on the basis that all foreign trips are junkets is small minded in the extreme. It does nothing to address the very real issues Glasgow faces, but does plenty to damage the mature, confident, outward-looking image the city has worked so hard to create.The artist and author Alasdair Gray, whose death at the weekend has left an unimaginable hole in Scotlandrsquos cultural landscape, wrote repeatedly about Glasgowrsquos magnicence and to a large extent it was him who helped shape our recognition and understanding of that. As he had the character Duncan Thaw say in his masterwork Lanark, unless a city has been used by an artist ldquonot even the inhabitants live there imaginatively. ldquoThink of Florence, Paris, London, New York, the character said. ldquoNobody visiting them for the first time is a stranger because hersquos already visited them in paintings, novels, history books and films.Alasdair Grayrsquos books and drawings, murals and poems have helped elevate Glasgow into the kind of city its inhabitants are proud to live in and whose visitors feel no strangeness in. Our civic leaders have a duty not just to nurture that legacy but to develop it too.Sure Glasgow has problems with potholes and cleanliness, homelessness and drug addiction, but Tory politicians and Labour-soaked unions are wrongthey think that public funds should be spent on fixing that and that alone. Glasgow has earned the right to host events and exhibitions that will play a part in its future prosperity, but its leaders have had to work hard for that - and not just in the City Chambers. To suggest otherwise displays a stunning lack of imagination."},{"url":null,"title":"councils-say-scotlands-smacking-ban-place-heavy-burden-social-workers","story":"A new survey of Scottish councillors also suggests a general lack of support for the controversial ban across local authority representatives of all main parties.The research, carried out by a group which argues against the smacking ban, claims three in four councillors who responded do not believe their council has the resources to handle the additional pressure that a smacking ban may bring.In addition, seven in  say social workers would fail to cope with extra caseloads created by the law, set to be introduced in the coming year.The survey also claims most councillors believe parents should be allowed to use reasonable chastisement, and that smacking should not become a criminal offence.Holyrood voted in October by  to  to support Scottish Greensrsquo MSP John Finniersquos anti-smacking bill which outlaws all physical punishment of children and raises the prospect of parents being prosecuted for any use of physical punishment on their own children.The legislation was given Royal Assent last month and is due to come into force in the coming year. It means Scotland will be the first UK country to outlaw smacking and will give young people the same protection from assault as adults.A consultation on Mr Finniersquos bill was widely supported by childrenrsquos charities however opponents have argued that the law already protected children from assault and the ban risked criminalising lsquogood parentsrsquo for using reasonable chastisement.It has been likened by some opponents to the Scottish Governmentrsquos failed lsquonamed personsrsquo legislation which was ditched following criticism that it could place ordinary families under undue scrutiny.The new research by campaign group Be Reasonable received  responses from  Scottish councillors, representing % of the countryrsquos local councillors.Despite claims that the survey is too small to be reliable, the group says it spotlights a deep ide between the views of local politicians and Holyrood.It also warns that while the law change could see increased pressure on social services and a need for extra training for teachers and health workers, there has so far been no indication that the Scottish Government plans to release funds to help cover additional costs.Be Reasonable spokesman Jamie Gillies, said: ldquoThree-quarters of councillors who completed the survey felt local authorities will not cope with additional pressures brought about by a change in the law.ldquoCrucially, social workers ndash who are already cracking under the pressure of identying and helping vulnerable children ndash are also thought to be unable to cope.ldquoMany councillors seem aghast at the prospect of a smacking ban which would tie up social workers, deplete local authority resources and affect services for years to come when there is no reliable evidence to show that mild physical discipline is harmful to children.ldquoWhen signicant numbers of councillors in all of the main parties oppose legislation the Government should take notice.The survey claims seven in  councillors think parents should be allowed to use reasonable chastisement on their children. A similar number do not think smacking should become a criminal offence.While only the Scottish Conservatives opposed the bill in Holyrood, the survey suggests half of SNP and Lib Dem councillors who responded agree that parents should be permitted to use reasonable chastisement with their children. The numbers were higher among Labourand Conservative .Meanwhile, more than seven in  councillors felt the Government should finance the implications of a smacking ban ldquoas fully as necessary over time and provide ldquopublic assurances that no other frontline services will be affected as a consequence of the Bill erting resources.According to Be Reasonable responses to the survey from councillors suggests confusion over how the smacking ban might work, with one apparently unclear over whether the new law would apply to foreign tourists and another raising concerns that it may lead to family disputes and unproven allegations.One councillor commented that ldquosomeneed a quick, harmless smack on the leg or bottom to save them from harm, while another raised concerns that the legislation is ldquooverly heavy-handed and is not proportionate to the issue.Others raised concerns over the extra workload for police and social services, with one commenting: ldquoAs usual with Scottish Government, they will simply pass the buck to hard-pressed local authorities, as they have with so many other subjects.ldquoIf they want this it must be fully resourced out of their annual underspend.Responding to the survey, Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser said: ldquoItrsquos typical of the SNP to rush through a headline-grabbing law without thinking about the consequences.ldquoThe Nationalists were well-warned about these challenges but blundered on regardless.ldquoNow we have a situation where the SNP is creating criminals of ordinary parents and placing immense pressure on council services which are already struggling to cope.Childrenrsquos Minister Maree Todd said: ldquoThe Act gives children, without exception, the same protection from assault as adults.ldquoThis is backed by an overwhelming majority of public opinion and commanded support from a wide range of Scottish society including the Church of Scotland, Scottish Womenrsquos Aid, the Royal College of Paediatrics  Child Health , Children First and Barnardorsquos.ldquoWe are working in partnership with organisations including local authorities, childrenrsquos charities, Social Work Scotland and Police Scotland to raise awareness of the Act and build on the existing support we offer to children and families."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-reassures-eu-citizens-new-year-message","story":"The First Minister highlighted theUN climate change summit in Glasgow in November as key date for the year ahead, which she said would give Scotland the chance to show it is leading by example.Addressing the UKrsquos scheduled exit from the EU in January, the SNP leader sought to reassure EU citizens and said the Scottish Government would work towards giving people the opportunity to ldquodetermine Scotlandrsquos future.:Nicola Sturgeon lsquoshowboatingrsquo instead of fixing public services, opposition claimldquoAs we celebrate the start of  and a new decade, we look forward to a year in which Scotland will be at the centre of international attention, she said.ldquoIn November, the United Nations climate change summit in Glasgow will attract more than , people from around the world.ldquoHopefully that summit will lead to progress in tackling the most important issue that the world faces.ldquoAnd it will give Scotland a chance to show that we are leading by example ndash not just by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions but by doing so in a way that helps to build a fairer, healthier and happier society.The First Minister added:ldquoThe Glasgow summit comes near the end of what will be a historic year.ldquoAgainst the wishes of most people in Scotland, we will leave the European Union at the end of January.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh said it was \"disappointed\" at the move.:Edinburgh gets set forHogmanaycelebrationsLast month, Edinburghs council leader ordered urgent action after memorial benches were moved and piled up to make way for the capitalrsquos Christmas market. The benches were dumped at the edge of the market in East Princes Street Gardens.They are understood to cost thousands of pounds and families donate them to the park in memory of loved ones.Christmas market operator Underbelly said they were handled respectfully.The Edinburgh Hotels Association has also said it wants an urgent rethink of how the city is promoted globally in the wake of the row over the Hogmanay event and the Christmas festival.The Christmas market, which is also run by Underbelly and has taken over an expanded site across Princes Street Gardens for its six-week run, attracting about , visitors a day, has already been the source of controversy this year.Edinburgh World Heritage, the organisation charged with protecting the citys status as a Unesco site, said it should be scaled back, saying it ldquoclearly disrupts this magnicent environment to a very great extent.There has been further criticism on social media over the pound charge - including a pound booking fee - to take part in the annual New Years Day Loony Dook n which people e into the freezing waters of the Firth of Forth at South Queensferry, often in fancy dress.The registration fee was introduced when it became part of the Edinburgh Hogmanay Festival from . The fee originally pound was introduced to cover the cost of organisation and stewarding.It wasraised to pound in  and is now pound with an amount from every ticket going to the RNLI.The festive fiasco has highlighted wider worries about the citys direction, which stretches to concerns over holiday lettings in Edinburgh, as Airbnb lets alone have doubled to , since . The Edinburgh World Heritage Trust, among other groups, has drawn attention to the loss of community around the Royal Mile and Old Town as residents have moved out.In the summer, Edinburgh fringe director Shona McCarthy has said the festival is ldquoseriously in danger of being anti-tourist, describing the suggestion that the fringe itself was contributing to excessive tourism as weird.But Mr Bartlam of Underbelly has accused critics of taking advantage of the controversy to make a political point.He said: \"This whole issue is a bit of a red herring and a mis-truth. This event has never prevented residents coming to their own properties.\"There has been a system in place which was a system created by the council and the previous operator of the contract years ago which obviously meant that residents that lived within the event arena had to have a wristband, as many as they needed for their household and that continues and now no-one is prevented from getting access.\"There is a wider conversation going on in Edinburgh at the moment around the impact of festivals and the vast majority of people in Edinburgh understand the cultural, social and economic benefit of amazing festivals like Hogmanay.\"There are some that feel that there are too many of these and are potentially using some suggestions of residents not being allowed access which is untrue as a way of pushing that view.\"Mr Bartlam added that only nine people had contacted Underbelly worried about a potential lack of passes, and claimed Hogmanay brings nearly poundm to the city in economic benefit.He said: \"Everyone can get a pass for the number of people in their property or people they want to have.\"The organisers have, however, acknowledged there had been \"misunderstandings\" and rewrote website guidance following the backlash, which now reads: \"If you are planning a privatewithin your home or you are entertaining guests or you have a household larger than six, additional access passes are available.\"Edinburgh City Council leader Adam McVey said the event had been affected by \"poor communication\", adding: \"It is unacceptable that the guidance for residents didnt accurately reflect this, creating unnecessary confusion.\"Mike Small of the Citizen Network, an Edinburgh-based campaign organisation aiming to transform the capital into ldquoa place for people rather than profit told supporters in his latest blog of how the Hogmanay fiasco had provided a boost to its campaign. Here are the highlights.Hogmanay is a time for New Yearrsquos Resolutions, ours is letrsquos reclaim our city from hidden networks and businesses carving up Edinburgh for profit.The Underbelly Hogmanay fiasco goes on and on.First of all we have been overwhelmed by the numbers of people registering with Citizen after the latest Underbelly debacle.

At first it was all fine, then it was that this had been the arrangement for years, now itrsquos all a terrible misunderstanding.The reality is that this is not about one incident but the whole relationship between the city its residents and this company- and the widespread resentment that they are completely unregulated and given far too much power.Why should one private company be in charge of entire cultural experiences One of the key unanswered questions is what is the process by which this company secures long term contracts with the city to provide events which many people believe are poorly managed and badly conceived Secondly how is it possible to be both in receipt of public funding and simultaneously claiming that you wonrsquot reveal your profits for commercial confidentiality That stinks.Itrsquos more ldquoFollow the Cash Cow than ldquoFollow the Cow.Since the latest controversy Citizen has been inundated with hundreds of requests from people to join up.Citizen is a network of people working to re-imagine the city as a sustainable place for people to live in, not just a space for consumption and profit.Next year wersquoll be hosting a series of events bringing people together who want to reclaim and reimagine the city."},{"url":null,"title":"humiliated-mcconnell-admitted-d-day-mistake-cabinet","story":"JACK McConnell told his cabinet he had made the ldquowrong decision after there was a public uproar about him snubbing the event marking the th anniversary of D-Day in favour of a golf club dinner.Newly released archives show the then Labour First Minister admitted the error, seen as one of the worst misjudgements of his career, after being forced to change his plans at the last minute.The incident is referred to in Scottish cabinet minutes from June  which are unsealed today by the National Records of Scotland.A keen golfer, Mr McConnell had earlier in the year accepted an invitation from Prince Andrew to the th anniversary dinner of the Royal and Ancient Club in St Andrews.After he was later asked by the French Government to attend the main event marking the D-Day landings in Normandy, he choose to stick with the golf bash.He then sent an email round to all his ministers askinganyone  wanted to go to Normandy in his place and the then finance minister Andy Kerr volunteered.When the arrangement emerged three days before the D-Day anniversary, Mr McConnell was condemned by veterans and accused of insulting those who helped liberate Europe.One member of the Normandy Veteransrsquo Association Scotland said Mr McConnell should be ldquoashamed and ldquocould do with a kick up the backside, adding: ldquoWithout the veterans there would be no Scottish Executive and no first minister.rsquorsquoWithin  hours, Mr McConnell was forced into a humiliating retreat, making an impromptu statement to the media in which he said he did not want the event ldquoturned into a political contest.He attended alongside Tony Blair and the Queen.The cabinet minutes of  June  recorded: ldquoThe First Minister said that he took personal and full responsibility for the decisions on his diary. Where the wrong decision had been made and he had the chance to correct it, he was happy to do so.ldquoHe said that it had been a great honour to represent Scotland at the commemorations in Normandy on Sunday,  June on the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. The ceremonies had been very professional and emotional.ldquoThe contribution and sacrice which Scots, and forces from all over the world, had made to the liberation of Europe through their involvement in the Normandy landings had ensured the preservation of democracy.ldquoHe paid tribute to those who had given their lives in the landings.An analysis of news and current events presented to the cabinet described Mr McConnell enduring ldquofierce criticism for turning down an invitation to attend the D-Day commemorations.After he reversed his position, there were then ldquonumerous articles and editorial in the weekend newspapers, ldquomainly focused on the First Ministerrsquos lsquoU-turnrsquo and the role played by his advisers.Bizarrely, the then Labour First Minister of Wales was caught up in a similar row, agreeing to attend a golf event at the Celtic Manor resort near Newport to discuss Wales hosting the  Ryder Cup, instead of going to Normandy.Other cabinet minutes also show Mr McConnell trying to fix another of his mistakes.After publicly supporting Glasgow singer Michelle McManus through her successful bid to win TVrsquos Pop Idol in , he conspicuously failed to congratulate Ayrshire violinist Nicola Benedetti when she won the less-watched BBC Young Musician of the Year in .He called three days later - after growing public criticism - and suddenly announced he was holding a reception for successful young Scots.The cabinet minute of  May  records: ldquoThe First Minister said that he had congratulated Nicola Benedetti on being the first Scot to win the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition.ldquoShe was one of many Scottish young people who had awards and recognition in ious fields, including sport and culture. He planned to hold a reception in the summer celebrating the success or young Scots over the past  months in all fields, and asked Cabinet members to nominate young people who might be involved to attend the event.Coming shortly after his infamous kilt and blouse outfit in New York, the Normandy and Benedetti gaffes made  a turning point for Mr McConnellrsquos credibility."},{"url":null,"title":"hogmanay-celebrations-begin-edinburgh","story":"The streets of Edinburgh filled up with Hogmanay revellers preparing to welcome in the start of a new decade and enjoy the UKs biggest street party.Performances from Idlewild, Rudimental and Marc Almond were taking place on stages throughout the city centre, while DJ Mark Ronson is ushering in the new year, creating a new soundtrack ahead of the clock striking .Approximately , visitors are expected to attend the event, according to organisers who billed the Hogmanay celebrations as the UKs biggest New Years Eve street party.TV stars Ant and Dec took to the stage in Princes Street Gardens earlier in the evening as crowds gathered, playing music and introducing the first firework display of the night.Street theatre, circus acts and musical performances also took place up across more than a dozen streets, including the citys main throughfare Princes Street and its adjacent gardens, while ceilidhs danced their way into the night in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle.There had been criticism of the events organisation, amid uncertainty around how many passes residents were allowed, with Underbelly - which also runs the Edinburgh Festival Fringe - accused of creating \"unnecessary confusion\" by the council leader.The festivities began in the city on Monday as around , people joined a torchlit procession which culminated in them forming the shape of two humans reaching out a \"hand of friendship\".Leading the parade down the Royal Mile and into Holyrood Park was a -strong cast from Celtic Fire Theatre company PyroCeltica."},{"url":null,"title":"hogmanay-2019-excuse-selling-scotland-seans-scottish-hogmanay-reviews","story":"Scotland**Hogmanay **Only an Excuse ***Seanrsquos Very Scottish Hogmanay **Selling Scotland **HOGMANAY without Jackie Bird.

In a further sign of the scorched earth policy pursued by BBC Scotland chiefs, musicians Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain had been given their jotters.The evening began with a half hour show on BBC Scotland, just to make sure the new channel on the block felt included and useful.

Susan Calmanrsquos Not Quite the End of the Year Show was a chat session so cosy and congratulatory it made Wogan look like Stalinrsquos show trials. The tone for the evening was set: safety first, mind how you go, have any flavour you like as long as it is vanilla.The main event kicked off at . on BBC Scotland and was simulcast on BBC Scotland. We were back in what looked like the prerecorded chat show with Calman. Her guests earlier in the evening, James Cosmoand Mark Bonnar , had been joined by Line of Dutyrsquos Martin Compston and Jane McCarry of Still Game. Tame banter followed.The hard work was being done by Clarke in Edinburgh and Irons in Stonehaven. Irons was shouty and hoarse, but at least she was animated. Clarke was confident and competent, though he was rather ahead of the crowd on the big countdown.Back indoors, Travis continued to play the studio gig like it was a corporate event, with the audience standing around like some middle aged Top of the Pops crowd who were missing their beds.As for the rest of it, particularly the Calman end of things, where was the jeopardy, the excitement, the raw buzz of a truly live gig  The only part that offered genuine bangs for the viewerrsquos buck were the fireworks after the bells.

Weatherman of the STV parish, Sean is licensed to tell you when it is going to bucket down.The location for the party, Craufurdland Castle in Ayrshire, was a cut above. Gold star for the production team on that one, eventhe rather snug surroundings made it look as though we were dropping in on the smallest ceilidh in the world.Dressed in full kilt with accessorising earpiece, Sean took to the part of host with his trademark big daft laddie gusto. Besides interviewing the laird and his we, he had been out and about filming segments on Hogmanay traditions. In the Borders he made black bun, and in Dundee he watched two women put a dress on a herring. Something to do with ensuring the family fish barrel would always be full, or so they told him.Meanwhile, back in the castle, Seanrsquos presenting partner, Jenner Reoch, was learning what the Craufurd family ate in olden days . ldquoItrsquos basically Instagram, said a thrilled Reoch as the laird read from old kitchen diaries.True, Sean and Jen gave Emily Maitlis and Andrew Neil nothing to worry about on the interviewing front, and the production flowed as naturally as treacle uphill, but at least an effort had been made to offer something fresh.Selling Scotlandhad the slickness, but it was  minutes of telly trying to pass as an hourrsquos worth. Much of the territory, including the Tennentrsquos ldquolager lovelies, had been covered before, though it was nice to see the likes of Molly Weir popping into neighboursrsquo houses uninvited to show them how to clean a floor with Flash, and pea and ham from a chicken will always raise a smile.As was pointed out several times, the ads were very much of their time, which apparently made it fine to show sexism and racism that would not have made it through the door any other night.ldquoI canrsquot believe we got away with showing all those ads on the BBC, said Docherty as the show closed. Neither can I, but thatrsquos Hogmanay telly for you a lot of cheek, a bit of charm, and thank Rabbie Burns it is over again for another year."},{"url":null,"title":"rosemary-goring-100-ways-survive-2020","story":"Count butterflies.Give a pint of blood.Visit a gallery at least once a month.

As we approach the end of this decade , a great deal seems to have changed in political terms, and yet not at all in the way that most of us might have anticipated ten years ago.We were sure that we were in for a tough time of it, economically. The optimistic view was then that the discipline involved in austerity would lead to root and branch reform of the structures of capitalism, tackling monopolistic firms and overhauling the banking system. There was also the expectation that it would offer the opportunity for a rolling back of the state, welfare and pensions reform and a radical reconstruction of the tax system.But almost none of that happened. The banks and the corporatist rent-seekers continue much as before. The reduction in public spending has not been strictly speaking, a reduction in spending, but merely a reduction in the rate of its increase. The tax burden is at a high as is the national debt. The new government ndash a Conservative government, allegedly ndash is aiming to spend even more.The changes, which never transpired, were to be ushered in by a new sort of consensual, centrist politics in the form of the ldquoheir to Blair, David Cameron, and his Liberal Democrat partners. His jibe to Mr Blair, that he ldquowas the future once, looks more pointed now that Mr Cameron himself is history, while his programme of reforms, promises of stability, ldquoa new kind of politics and a ldquoBig Society, are as dead as the Charleston.What was going to be the decade of consensus turned out to be contention and ision on an almost unprecedented scaleyou were looking for historical comparisons you would probably have to pick something like Irish Home Rule or the Corn Laws. What was going to be a transformative politics turned out to be a period of paralysis ndash the apparent paradox is that one reason the political landscape now looks so dferent is that almost nothing could be done while Brexit and independence swept aside the day-to-day issues.The other thing wildly dferent from what might have been assumed ten years ago is where the centre ground in politics actually is. When Mr Cameron and ldquoI agree with Nick Clegg appeared in the garden of Number , we expected government that would be, for the foreseeable future, fiscally conservative and socially liberal.But now that it appears that nobody agrees with Nick, or with his successors in the leadership of the Liberal Democrats, it looks asthe UKrsquos political centre is voters who are fiscally slightly to the centre-left, and socially rather more conservative than metropolitan liberals would like.Contrary to the claims of their opponents, the Conservatives under Boris Johnson have not moved sharply to the right ndash with the exception of their rhetoric on immigration, which, awkwardly for liberals, seems to chime with the general opinion of the voters. In most other regards, the Tories have become steadily more centrist, especially on public spending, while remaining socially liberal on most issues.If it doesnrsquot look like that to some people, itrsquos because the Labour Party has been even more radically transformed into what, to all intents and purposes, seems to be the Bennite wing of the Labour Party in the s. Amazingly, after their catastrophic results in the election, the membership seems inclined to double down on this position, despite the evidence that the only people inclined to vote Labour are their own activists. A membership of around , may be the biggest of any European political party, but itrsquos not an awfully big percentage of the UK electorate.The SNP, unsurprisingly, continues to bang on about independence, which is fair enough, since it is its raison drsquoecirctre. The partyrsquos persistent strength is obviously in part due to their success in converting so many Scots to the cause, but it presents them with problems, too.One is the dficulty of uniting the country on anything  when the subject dominates all discourse another is the practical matter of being the government, and being expected to deliver on domestic policy issues. Long-term electoral success, as Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair discovered, always leads to public disenchantment eventually.We start the new decade with a UK government once more promising real change and improvement. The Whig theory of historymade the assumption that you could explain the present in terms of the past, with the implication that the present was better. Irsquom not sure anyone believes that anymore. On the evidence of the past decade, we should probably just expect the unexpected."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Labour has to learn the language of progressive nationalism if it is to survive","story":"But people rarely vote on their own narrow material interest, rather on what they think is best for the country as a whole.

I would further point out to Mr Roden that in the interests of compromise and to lessen the effects of the chaos about to engulf Scotland, Ms Sturgeon offered to take a second independence vote off the tablethe then Prime Minister Theresa May would agree to Scotland remaining within the single market and customs union a request which was denied.Following the result of the General Election, which means that there will not be a second EU referendum and that the UK is definitely leaving the EU, Mr Roden comments that ldquowe will now never know for surethat is what the people really want.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”The government’s failure to fund the ageing inter-island ferry fleet has left Orkney’s most remote and vulnerable communities with an inferior service compared to other areas in Scotland claimed Councillor Stockan.Following a y battle, the council secured £. million in additional government funding for internal ferry services for   — described by Councillor Stockan at the time as the “most signicant financial breakthrough” made by the council in years.The air of positivity failed to last however.OIC say they need £. million to run services in the current financial year — £. million more than the Scottish Government allocation.“This is a burden that most other Scottish councils do not have to bear,” Councillor Stockan continued. “The greater the burden placed on the council to keep the ferries running, the greater the risk of severe cuts to other vital services our community depends upon.“We need a long-term commitment from the government to fully fund the cost of running the service and replacing vessels with modern, cheaper-to-run ferries of a standard you would expect on routes as important as these.”RET was also in Councillor Stockan’s sights.The tarf, which would see cheaper fares for all when travelling across the Pentland Firth, has been mired in legal proceedings with Pentland Ferries making a complaint to the European Commission.From the outset, those at Holyrood said they were committed to see the scheme introduced within the first six months of . However, there appears to be no resolution in sight as we now head into .“It is outrageous that we in Orkney are still waiting for RET and that there appears to be no urgency or political will from the Government to resolve this.“Again, this is a clear case of discrimination against Orkney and our community will find it abominable that the money the government has saved by failing to introduce RET on our routes has been spent where — when it could have been committed to supporting our internal ferry service.“This is why I have written to the First Minister and appealed for her to intervene and ensure that Orkney is treated as fairly as other coastal communities with leline ferry services.”In response, a Scottish Government spokesperson indicated that the government was committed to finding a resolution to the issues raised.The spokesperson said: “At present, Orkney Islands Council are wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.#However, the Scottish Government understands the signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities and we have made clear our commitment to Orkney internal ferry services with the provision of additional revenue funding support totalling £. million in the last two years.“We continue to discuss long term solutions with both Orkney Islands Council and Shetland Islands Council. We established a working group to examine these issues and we are now in receipt of the final report which we are currently considering.”The spokesperson continued: “It is the responsibility of inidual local authorities to manage their own budgets and to allocate the total financial resources available to them, including on ferry services, on the basis of local needs and priorities, having first fulfilled their statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities.“Ultimately, it is for locally elected representatives to make local decisions on how best to deliver services to their local communities.“Ministers remain committed to pursuing all avenues to deliver RET for Orkney and Shetland, however, the first step is to resolve the complaint that Pentland Ferries have made to the European Commission.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He was only  when The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock became his first professionally published poem.His best known works include The Waste Land, The Hollow Men and Four Quartets.The first poem in the Quartets series, called Burnt Norton, piques the interest of enthusiasts of the poet, says Eliot scholar Frances Dickey, because of lines that suggest missed opportunities and what might have been with his muse.The poem is named after a home in England that Eliot visited with Hale in . ldquoHis relationship with her seems to be deep and meaningful and itrsquos a door he chose not to open, said Ms Dickey.The letters could also reveal details about Eliotrsquos conversion to Anglicanism, something he deeply cherished, she added.Ms Dickey, who was one of the editors of The Complete Prose of TS Eliot, said the poet was deeply ashamed of his marriage to his first we, Vivienne Haigh-Wood, who he was with for more than  years.She said the letters could reveal just how close he and Hale were andthe two ever considered marriage.ldquoWas this an epistolary romance they would carry across the Atlantic  said Ms Dickey. ldquoWhat role did she play in his emotional le Eliotrsquos letters to Hale began after that first marriage ended.Whatever  she was, Hale was a link to the le Eliot had left behind in the United States as a young man, Ms Dickey said.ldquoHe was really thinking more about the United States and his childhood during the period where he was in correspondence with Hale, she said. ldquoI have a feeling that having a relationship with an American woman helped him to uncover his past in a way.

Directed by Jezza Neumann, it allowed a handful of children to give first-hand accounts of le on the financial margins.The fact those featured were so young stripped their commentary of artice. They talked in matter-of-fact tones of hardships that would have broken many adults. Courtney, eight, who lives in Cambridge – “the most unequal city in the UK” – counted out coppers in the hope there would be enough for heating, before resigning herself to another night spent sleeping in her coat. Cameron, a pale and undernourished boy, described eking out diminishing food supplies. “We try not to eat a lot in one day, even though most of us are really hungry,” he said.Growing Up Poor painted a picture of the UK that made A Christmas Carol, with all its paternalism, feel entirely contemporary a world where the working poor are forced to survive on charity hand-outs.It was jam-packed with heroes. There was Danielle, who tried to carve out a bit of space in temporary accommodation to study for her GCSEs, and Courtney’s mother, who drew a chart to try to explain her depression to her daughter. Then there were those who donated to and ran the food banks, and Neumann himself, who avoided all the pitfalls of poverty porn to bring us this thoughtful piece of film-making. The villains – the architects of the Westminster government’s austerity programme – were less visible, but ever-present, behind the scenes, undermining the foundations that used to keep the lives of the underprivileged stable. Iain Duncan Smith’s welfare reforms were the dark heart of Growing Up Poor. Whatever his original intention, those reforms and the striver skiver rhetoric they produced were responsible for pushing just-coping families into destitution .And yet Duncan Smith is among those being rewarded in the New Year’s Honours list. Much to the horror of anti-poverty campaigners, the man behind Universal Credit, the bedroom tax and the two-child cap – three of the most odious policies of the decade – is being knighted because ofthe havoc he wreaked. That’s the way it goes nowadays. Those who sow chaos and confusion are gloried, while those left to pick up the pieces of their own and other people’s lives remain in the shadows. The likes of Duncan Smith lack the insight to be embarrassed by such unseemly boys’ club back-slapping. He will doubtless regard himself as a fitting recipient of the title Sir – asUniversal Credit had fulfilled its mission of helping millions back into work rather than entrenching misery and social exclusion.It was, famously, in Easterhouse, that Duncan Smith experienced an epiphany. Back in , he wept in the face of condemned tenements and boarded up lives. This moment of empathy inspired him to evangelise about “compassionate Conservatism”. Under his leadership, he pledged, the Tories would become “the natural party of those who want to make a better le for themselves and their children”.How hollow that sounds now. Yet, with hindsight, that phrase foreshadowed everything that would go wrong with his welfare reforms. It hinted at that most Dickensian of binaries: the deserving and the undeserving poor. It made a spurious distinction between “those who want to make a better le for themselves” and those considered too feckless to care.There are groups, including the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, who believe Universal Credit was a good idea in principle. It was aimed at simplying an over-complicated system by rolling six benefits into one, and – more importantly – at incentivising people to work.The logic was, on the face of it, unimpeachable. The way the benefits system was structured meant those who moved from claiming, say, Jobs Seekers Allowance, to low-paid employment would often find themselves losing out financially, which cannot be right.But with this logic came other shakier assumptions: that everyone ought to be entering the labour market that no-one would ever be too ill to work or have other competing pressures on their time, such as caring for children, the elderly or the disabled.And so a new era was indeed ushered in: an era of sanctions and Atos fitness-for-work tests, which saw benefit claimants penalised for attending funerals and the chronically ill forced to prove they had not staged some miraculous recovery. It was the era of being punished for having an extra bedroom – evenyour own child slept in it every other weekend. It was the era of growing mental health dficulties and soaring suicides. The era of I, Daniel Blake.Universal Credit caused more problems than it solved,it solved any. It was supposed to help people into work. But in , the Institute for Fiscal Studies claimed some groups, such as single parents, had less of an incentive to work under Universal Credit than the old system and that . million working families faced an average loss of £, a year.The five-week hiatus before Universal Credit was received meant claimants like Courtney’s mother had no money to feed their children. They were forced to go to food banks or to take out loans they had no hope of repaying.By the time the National Audit Office issued its scathing report in , Duncan Smith was gone. He resigned over cuts to disability benefits in , and four more work and pensions secretaries followed in quick succession. But the conceptual and logistical flaws the NAO report identied were ones that originated under his watch. Head of the organisation, Amyas Morse, said the case for Universal Credit was based on unproven assumptions. “We think the larger claims for universal credit, such as boosted employment, are unlikely to be demonstrable at any point in future,” he said.Nor has the situation improved over the last  months. Last month, the UN rapporteur for extreme poverty, Philip Alston, said the UK government’s austerity policies were driven by “a political desire for social engineering” and that key elements of the post war social contract devised by William Beveridge had been swept away.Alston also insisted the UK government was in a state of denial about reports suggesting  million people, a fth of the population, now live in poverty, with . million destitute.It is in the same spirit of denial, no doubt, that Duncan Smith was offered and accepted his knighthood. His elevation further undermines an already discredited honours system. \u2028But it is entirely in tune with today’s politics: cruelty and incompetence rewarded by a self-promoting clique, while those working long hours to improve people’s lives might as well be invisible.As the MP for Chingford and Woodford Green kneels on the red carpet at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle, what will Courtney be doing  Or Cameron  Or Danielle  They will be struggling on, supporting their parents through the worst of their misery. Unfortunately, there are no knighthoods for stoicism. Or resilience. Or making the best of things.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

On policing costs, cabinet minutes noted: “The Treasury has indicated that they would help meet costs,” but the initial offer was only a  per cent contribution.“This was potentially a very serious situation as the costs associated with the summit would inevitably be in the public domain.“In the event that it proved impossible to make sufficient further progress, cabinet would need to consider the consequences of ious options, including a major public dispute with the UK Government.“The First Minister has made it clear to senior members of the UK Government that failure to reach agreement on policing and security costs would place the Executive in an intolerable position which it would feel obliged to explain publicly.”The political row over policing costs would drag on for another year, with the Scottish Government eventually confirming it would foot the bill for extra security.In March , then chancellor Gordon Brown pledged to hand Holyrood an extra £m towards security costs. The SNP, then in opposition, claimed that Westminster should have paid all of the associated policing costs.In December that year it was revealed the final cost of security for the G summit was £m.Police from across the UK were drafted in as leaders met at Gleneagles, with thousands of protesters gathering in Edinburgh.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch to remain a proud mongrel nation scotland must stop foreigner blaming","story":"Will le become unpleasant for EU nationals in  as European leaders start playing hardball in tough and probably nasty trade negotiations  Boris Johnson has an overwhelming mandate to get Brexit done. That shouldn’t mean a negative focus on EU citizens living here, but as British and European leaders arm-wrestle their way through the year ahead, producing us versus them narratives and “Hop off you frogs” headlines aplenty, it probably will. In  a new Labour leader will probably officially embrace Brexit and leave millions of Remain voters south of the Border without any means of democratic expression, thanks also to the collapse of the bickering People’s Vote campaign and the leaderless Lib Dems. Anyone hoping the main Westminster opposition parties will swtly recover from the failed Brexit battles of yesteryear to refocus on the human rights battles of tomorrow is likely to be disappointed.The enlarged cohort of SNP MPs has the energy, mandate and moral authority to champion the views of the “losing” side, raise important questions about the way Brexit is managed and persuade gung-ho Leave voters that giving Boris carte blanche over every aspect of British le is not a good idea. But the third largest party at Westminster is customarily ignored by politicians and the mainstream media. There’s no reason to think  will be any dferent.South of the Border at least, Europeanism has suddenly become as unfashionable and last season as glittery cards, wrapping paper, carols and Brussels sprouts – a Christmas tradition which could, incidentally, disappearrivals follow the example set this Christmas by Morrisons and Asda and rebadge their sprouts with local origins. Soon, Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Scottish sprouts will be all we’ve ever known.A small thing perhaps and both supermarkets insist that pleasing Brexiters played no part in their re-labelling decisions. But maybe a sign of things to come. A sign that anything or anyone from a European country will soon smack of an alien culture. Is this overstating things  The statistics suggest not.The number of hate crimes recorded by police in England and Wales has more than doubled from , in - to a new record of , in  while the number of cases passed to prosecutors has dropped from  to just  per cent. Admittedly, referral rates have dropped across all types of offence, hate crimes sometimes don’t have named suspects, and out-of-court disposals don’t result in criminal charges. Suspects are also harder to identy when anonymous accounts are used to send abuse and threats online. But still, as weekend stabbings in a rabbi’s home north of New York City amply testy, attacks on minorities can happen in apparently tolerant environments. And Britain is not likely to be all that tolerant a place in . If EU leaders take a tough stance during forthcoming trade talks – as they surely must – the hostile and triumphalist Europhobic British press will have a field day, demonising EU institutions and painting European leaders as robbers and thugs determined to cheat the noble, freedom-seeking Brits. In this unpleasant and toxic political environment, unsuspecting, ordinary EU citizens will be on the receiving end of anti-Brussels sentiment. Indeed, that nasty process has already started, in some very surprising locations.A few customers at the Ceilidh Place Hotel and restaurant in Ullapool objected to a tiny EU flag mounted over the cash-desk. Days later, a French waiter was effectively told to get back home by a guest. Now all waiting staff wear T-shirts sporting the -stars of the EU flag on their backs, in solidarity with their French colleague and anyone  picked on for their ethnicity. Thanks to the hotel owners’ strong public stance, there’s been open discussion about changing public behaviour and some visitors have revealed bruising encounters they’ve experienced where. One Portuguese man living here for almost a decade, said customers now regularly demand to be served by “someone who speaks English properly,” at his workplace – a large High Street department store in Scotland. His English is almost perfect. A workmate also told him to stop using his native tongue while chatting with two other Portuguese speakers in the staff canteen. Are these incidents unusual one-offs or the tip of an iceberg set to grow larger as Britain’s acrimonious withdrawal from the EU dominates front pages and political discourse in   How will employers and managers respond Scotland prides itself on welcoming New Scots and Nicola Sturgeon was widely praised for reaching out to EU citizens straight after the  referendum, reassuring all who’d chosen to live and work here that Scotland was their home. This message of international solidarity gets loud cheers at independence rallies – partly because it neatly distinguishes Scots from very dferent English attitudes towards immigration, Europe and international cooperation. But are we just virtue-signalling and kidding ourselves  Are EU citizens getting almost as many pointed and unpleasant jibes in Remain-voting Scotland as Brexit-voting England  It’s impossible to know for sure. But these and other incidents should prompt the SNP to try and reconfigure the Westminster debate before Britain withdraws on  January. Otherwise, a very nasty scenario could develop – one in which EU nationals are singled out, pilloried and turned into scapegoats for the political and economic uncertainty that will inevitably arise as a wildly over-promising Conservative leader hits the brick wall of an unyielding and united bloc of EU trade negotiators. Agreed – the notion that Britain might somehow remain in the EU or single market, through the mechanism of a second vote, or a Remain alliance at Westminster is now officially dead, but the idea of a part-European identity and the internationalising impact of freedom of movement has always meant more to Scots Remain voters than the arcane details of tarf-free trade, and harmonised regulations. It still does. Protecting the rights of EU citizens living amongst us is an expression of enlightened self-interest, curiosity about other cultures, gratitude for the energy and enthusiasm of incomers and recognition of the enduring importance of respecting cultural and ethnic dference. Boris Johnson’s self-imposed December trade negotiations deadline is bound to ramp up anti-European, anti-foreigner rhetoric.If Scotland wants to remain a proud “mongrel nation”, we must hold the line against any descent into foreigner-blaming.

The Colin area representative has replaced newly elected MP for North Belfast John Finucane.Co-opted to Belfast City Council in Janaury , the -year-old told the Andersonstown News that it will be a “huge honour” to represent the people of Belfast.“What can I say, it’s amazing,” he said. “I’m honoured to have been asked by Sinn Féin to be the next Ard Mhéara of Belfast. “I have been an activist in the Colin area since I was . I’m very much about grassroots politics and that theme is something I want to continue. “I want to use the office of Mayor to bring politics from the ground up.” Having topped the council election poll in May, Danny spoke of how he will be continuing the civic work of party colleague John Finucane. “The role of Mayor is city-wide, I want to be a Mayor for all communities and to represent everybody. I want to champion the need for improvements to our mental health services. It’s something that has really impacted the Colin area. I want to use the office of Mayor to help in whatever way I can.

I want to pay tribute to outgoing Ard Mhéara John Finucane.

We have had ‘sympathy’ from the UK Government through the Secretary of State, from all political parties that stood on our picket lines and from the leadership of the health service. But we have no resolution.“UNISON has agreed emergency cover and our members have volunteered to provide it. We have never seen such determination in health workers who have been devalued and disrespected for almost  years. For  weeks they have stood up for their rights and have now put the health service at the top of the political agenda.“Despite their sacrice there is still no action from those in power. It would appear that health workers, patients and the public at large are being used as pawns in a political game.“As we enter this signicant period in the industrial struggle the consequences lay firmly on the shoulders of the UK Government, our elected politicians and the leadership of the civil service.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers. One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"dup mp opposes call to ban hunting with dogs","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Theyre a tradition which need to be maintained.\"On a wider point, I have never seen anything wrong with hunting for control, but people who complain about these hunts are missing the point.\"Its not about killing foxes, its about people with a love of horses and tradition coming together in a colourful occasion, occasions that have been held for years.\"The League Against Cruel Sports, though, maintains more than halfof respondents to polling carried out believe hunting with dogs is already banned in Northern Ireland as it is in England, Wales and Scotland.Janice Watt, senior public affairs officer for the campaign group in Northern Ireland, said hunting and killing animals for sport might satisfy a small minority, but most people find it repulsive.She added: \"With polling showing widespread opposition to this so-called sport, its clear that hunting should be made illegal in Northern Ireland, and the league is working hard to ensure that as soon as Stormont sits again we get a ban to bring our nation into line with the rest of the UK.\"In a poll of , people living here released by the group, % of respondents believe it should be made illegal to hunt deer with live dogs, compared to % who believe it should remain legal.When it comes to fox hunting, % of respondents believe that it should be made illegal to hunt the animals, compared to % who think it should remain legal.The polling, commissioned by the group, asked people aged  and over living in Northern Ireland their views on a iety of animal welfare topics, including hunting.Of those polled, % believe it is illegal to use dogs to hunt live animals in Northern Ireland, compared with % who think it is legal and % who did not know."},{"url":null,"title":"focus on border poll would lead to wasted decade says arlene foster in new year message","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

to avoid police,” she said.“So it’s about providing that police presence but with the plain-clothed officers working alongside and what that would look like on the ground is that the plain-clothed officers would see these tell-tale signs, inform their unormed colleagues, and then we would exercise our stop and search powers and conduct a stop and search.”Ms Foy said the feedback from the public and business community had been “very positive”.“Over the course of the six weeks the team visited the Christmas markets, shops, cafes and licensed premises to offer reassurance and advice on keeping staff and customers safe,” she said.“Officers engaged with council workers, post workers, security staff, street performers and members of the public who all played an important role in helping us keep people safe by being our eyes and ears and reporting suspicious activity and we’re grateful for their support.”It is anticipated that the dedicated Servator team will conduct patrols in towns and

The story sounds surreal, but in those distant days of journalism, anything might have been possible.In a review of the book,journalist Gerry Moriarty wrote: \"It is a cracking read, teeming with wit, great yarns and a finally sobering awareness of how his drinking was a form of slow suicide. Reynolds tells his stories with a craftsmans pitch: funny when appropriate, serious when dealing with the horrors of the Troubles, light yet quietly profound and self-aware when dealing with how alcohol almost killed him.\"No doubt some of Paddy Reynolds stories gained in the telling, but his memoirs gave a picture of a world of colourful print journalism that has long disappeared.Mr Reynolds died peacefully at his home in north Belfast on December  \"surrounded by his loving family\".He was predeceased by his we Enda, and survived by daughters Anne, Pauline, Joanie and Colette. His Requiem Mass will take place tomorrow at am in the St Therese of Lisieux Church, Somerton Road, Belfast, followed by interment at Carnmoney Cemetery."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

Former Chief Constable George Hamilton, who had described the officers as \"brave\", later apologised to the families of the teenagers.March: Soldier F is chargedIn March, a former Paratrooper was told he will face murder charges over the killing of two people on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in .The Public Prosecution Service said there was enough evidence to prosecute Soldier F for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney.William McKinneyThe sole prosecution was seen as a \"terrible disappointment\" by some of the families of the  people killed at a civil rights march on  January, .The day became known as Bloody Sunday - one of the darkest days of the Troubles.Soldier F also faces charges for the attempted murders of Patrick ODonnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon and Michael Quinn.The Public Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute  other soldiers and two Official IRA men.James Wrays brother Liam said he was \"very saddened for the other families\" of those killed on Bloody Sunday.\"Their hearts must be broken,\" he said.\"It has been a sad day but the Wray family are relieved.\"Linda Nash, whose brother William was shot dead, said she felt \"let down by a law and a justice system thats supposed to protect people\".But the news led to a loyalist campaign of support for Soldier F, with banners erected across Northern Ireland over what some saw as the unfair victimisation of former British soldiers who served here.April: Lyra McKee is shot dead by dissidentsJournalist Lyra McKeewas fatally shot in the head while observing rioting in Londonderrys Creggan estate in April. The New IRA later admitted carrying out the murder.Massive public outcry followed her death, with former prime minister Theresa May, Irish president Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar among those to attend her funeral at St Annes Cathedral in Belfast.Lyra McKeeThere was a standing ovation, and loud applause erupted, at her funeral service when priest Fr Martin Magill openly challenged the politicians in the pews over the ongoing Stormont stalemate. \"Why in Gods name does it take the death of a -year-old woman to get to this point \" he asked.In the days after the murder a protest by friends of Ms McKee took place outside the Londonderry offices of dissident republican political group Saoradh, which has been linked to the New IRA.A number of protesters smeared red handprints on republican slogans outside the office, and they quickly became a symbol for peace across the country.A strong LGBTQ activist, Belfast born Lyra had moved to Derry to be with her partner, Sara Canning, shortly before her death.Her book, Angels with Blue Faces, which deals with the  IRA murder of Belfast MP Robert Bradford, was published several months after her death.June: Boris tackles BrexitAway from the ongoing political turmoil as Stormont remained closed for business, the main topic in the political arena was Brexit.After several failed attempts to get her Brexit deal for the UK to leave the European Union through Parliament, Theresa May announced she would be standing down as Prime Minister on May .Mrs May was finally replaced by Boris Johnston after leaving office on June .After ing to the EU, Mr Johnson came back with a new deal, but several more failed attempts to find a route through parliament finally led to a General Election on December .Boris JohnsonBrexit brought particular concerns for Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK with an EU land border, and debate raged over the frontier. Business leaders said no-deal would have proved disastrous. The farming community was facing devastation with the loss of EU subsidies coupled with new trade tarfs between north and south. Experts warned that farmers would be left facing bankruptcy.A real issue for all was the lack of clarity about what any potential Brexit would mean for Northern Ireland. Everyone had an opinion on what Brexit would mean. When Mr Johnson ed with his new deal from the EU, it became known as the Betrayal Act by loyalists who saw it as a threat to the Union. They claimed it put an economic border in the Irish Sea and meant Northern Ireland would be treated dferently to the rest of the UK.Disagreements about what it all means for Northern Ireland will continue in the next  months.July: Lowry wins at PortrushJuly saw the worlds best golfers and thousands of golf fans flock to the north coast as Royal Portrush hosted The Open for the first time in almost  years.The championship generated more than £ million of economic benefit for Northern Ireland, according to a study commissioned by organisers and proved a real boost to the tourist industry with hotels sold out and fans flocking to the scenic location from across the world - , fans arrived on the north coast with more than half coming from outside Northern Ireland.Shane LowryThe figures helped boost predictions that  will be a record breaking year for tourism in Northern Ireland with .m people expecting to have visited in the year.Irish winner Shane Lowry lted the coveted Claret Jug at the end of the event, six shots clear of nearest challenger, Englands Tommy Fleetwood.

The biggest loser was the DUP, with Nigel Dodds ousted by Sinn Feins John Finucane after serving as North Belfast MP for  years. The DUP also lost South Belfast where the SDLPs Claire Hanna unseated Emma Little-Pengelly by over , votes. The DUP suffered a third blow in North Down where the Alliance Partys Stephen Farry claimed the seat vacated by independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon.Nigel DoddsWhile the DUP finished the election down from  seats to eight, Sinn Fein saw their majorities slashed across Northern Ireland - Mr Finucanes win tempered by a crushing defeat for Elisha McCallion in Foyle.

It’s either too dry, there’s no taste from it at all, and to avoid both those complaints requests are made for the ‘dark’ meat to be served to you. But still the vast majority of us will sit down to eat turkey on Christmas Day – but how did the big bird from America find its way onto our plates and manage to remain a permanent Yuletide fixture for centuries  googletag.cmd.push Turkeys were first brought into these islands in  by explorer William Strickland and before that those who had the money to buy them ate geese, boars heads, pheasant and even peacocks. Yorkshire man Strickland acquired six of the birds from native American traders on his travels around the New World and duly shipped them back to England. With the arrival of the turkey, a th century poem described Christmas dinner as: “Beefe, mutton and porke, shred pies of the best, pig, veal goose and capon and turkey well drest.” This was accompanied by cheese, apples, nuts and “good drink.” The turkey was also devoured because of purely pratical reasons by farmers because they needed to keep their cows to produce milk and their chickens for eggs. In the sixteenth century eggs were almost a luxury item and were accordingly expensive. googletag.cmd.push It is a matter of historical record that King Henry VIII began the tradition of eating turkey on Christmas Day, but it wasnt really until after WWII that the bird became more popular than goose on the big day. An English farmer, Thomas Tusser noted that by  turkeys had started to adorn Christmas tables, but that as well as geese another bird – the capon – a castrated rooster – remained the fowl of choice. And, that remained the case for another few centuries. By  turkey appears as a meat used in households as noted in a book called The English Housewe written by Gervase Markham. In the s the London Poulters Guild recorded that they had begun to give the company clerk a turkey as a Christmas gt. In the Victorian era, turkey was still too expensive to buy in comparison to its alternatives. There was a ision in tastes between northern and southern England. In the north, roast beef was favoured while in the south, goose remained the traditional choice. Poor families mostly made do with rabbit whether they were from the north or south. Recent research shows that today the average worker will need to toil for around . hours to afford a turkey, but as late as the s it would have cost the average weeks wages to buy one. Eating turkey at Christmas was popularised further by its most recogniseable literary reference. That of course came in  when Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol was published. The character of Scrooge famously sends his put upon clerk Bob Cratchit a huge turkey to replace his goose on Christmas morning. Post  food austerity changed any doubts about the correct choice for Christmas dinner. The sheer size of the turkey could more than adequately feed a sizeable family and the St Stephens Day leftovers could be turned into sandwiches, soup and stew. According to the British Poultry Council more than  million turkeys are killed every year –  million of those for the Christmas season alone. However that figure pales by comparison to the fact that in the U.S.A three hundred million turkeys meet their fate each year – mainly for Christmas and Thanksgiving. But outside of Ireland, Britain and America, turkey is not the favoured roast for Christmas Day. In Norway for example, the festive feast actually takes place on Christmas Eve and most around the costal regions of the country eat fish – mainly cod and haddock and a iety called lutefisk. Inland in Norway they opt for pork chops, specially prepared sausages and sometimes lamb. In neighbouring Sweden the Yuletide consists of a smorgasboard of caviar, shellfish, cooked and raw fish and cheeses. Further east in Ukraine people prepare huge broths crammed with meat while in the Czech Republic tradition decrees that the tree is not lit before Christmas Eve and is then followed by a dinner of fish soup, salads, eggs and carp. A macarbre tradition upheld by the Czechs is that the number of people at the table must be even, otherwise the person without a partner will die the following year. In Germany the traditions are much more straightforward with the Christmas Day feast consisting largely of wild boar or venison. Meanwhile in Jamaica, Christmas dinner usually consists of rice, gungo peas, chicken, ox tail and curried goat. Back in Western Europe, the Christmas dinner in Italy can last four over four hours. Most families will have seven or more courses including antipasti, a small portion of pasta, a roast meal followed by two salads and two puddings – then, cheese, fruit, brandy and chocolates. The Austrians take a more austere approach and on Christmas Day traditionally sit down to braised carp served with gingerbread and beer sauce. Poland pays no heed to the turkey at all. In fact they pay no mind to meat at all and knuckle down to  meat free dishes that represent the months of the year and which includes fish such as pike, herring and carp. Other typical Polish Christmas dishes are fish soup, sauerkraut with wild mushrooms or peas and traditional dumplings with ious fillings.

Ebenezer Scrooge wasnt the first fictional character to see ghosts at this time of year. In fact the tradition probably goes back further than Christmas itself. As the nights grow long and the year creeps towards its close its a natural instinct that people gather together. Its also natural that this time makes us think of people and places that are no longer here. These thoughts have often morphed into tales based on what we encounter at this time of year - winter, death and the eventual rebirth experienced in spring. googletag.cmd.push In Europe this was usually connected to the pagan rituals surrounding the winter solstice known as Yule. The shortest and darkest day of the year was viewed as a time when the dead would have access to the living. The telling of tales at Yuletide began to decline as TV took over as the main form of household entertainment, but it must also be remembered that when Dickens published A Christmas Carol in  the tradition of Christmas itself was also in decline. In fact, for most people in that era Christmas was a working day because the Industrial Revolution meant fewer days off for everyone. As a result, Christmas was considered relatively unimportant and no one really complained. googletag.cmd.push The beginning of disregarding Christmas had come courtesy of Oliver Cromwell around  years earlier. The puritanical Lord Protector of England who in the th Century was “on a mission to cleanse the nation of its most decadent excesses.” These excesses unfortunately included banning Christmas celebrations, its ghostly tales and traditions with even carols making his draconian hit list. Oliver Cromwell is of course remembered in Ireland for his other exploits including the deaths of thousands of people as the result of his orders. But despite his best efforts he failed to quell the traditions of folklore carried over from pre-Christian Ireland. In the Irish tradition, ghosts are called taidhbhse or tais and live in a place halfway between this le and the next. The spirits are held here by some earthly affection or unfulfilled duty or anger against the living. Those who die suddenly, more commonly than others, are believed to become haunting Ghosts. They go about moving the furniture, and in every way trying to attract attention. It was also believed that when the soul has left the body, it is drawn away, sometimes, by the fairies. Such souls are considered lost. If a soul eludes the fairies, it may be snapped up by the evil spirits. The weak souls of young children were especially in danger. In western Ireland for example, people sprinkled the threshold with the blood of a chicken when a very young child died so that the spirits may be drawn away to the blood. A ghost was also compelled to obey the commands of the living. One old tale said, the stable-boy up met the master going round the yards after he had been two days dead, and told him to be away with him to the lighthouse, and haunt that and there he is far out to sea still. Oscar Wildes mother who studied and wrote about the supernatural thought it was only spirits who were too bad for heaven, and too good for hell, who were caught halfway between paradise and damnation. It was also thought that the souls of the dead sometimes took the shapes of animals. They will sometimes take the forms of insects, especially butterflies. If you see one fluttering near a corpse, that is the soul, and is a sign of its having entered upon immortal happiness. The author of the Parochial Survey of Ireland, , heard a woman say to a child who was chasing a butterfly, How do you know it is not the soul of your grandfather. Spirits who remain inside houses can also take on many shapes, including that of the elf and sometimes also of a rat, cat, or black dog. In their natural state they are invisible to people, but they can become visible in these forms. They make a lot of noise in the house at night and live between the walls, in the attic or in the cellar, in the stable, in the shed, sometimes even in a large tree beside the house. These ghosts are not considered particularly intelligent, and remain friendly as long as they are treated well. They like to tease lazy people by pulling the blankets off their beds and sending icy drafts through the room. They also delight in knocking over milk pails and keeping people awake by constantly tapping on the walls. When made very angry, they become malevolent. Their noise making becomes unbearable they throw stones, the cattle become sick, drought or cold weather or continuous storms occur. They leave the house or farm only when it has been totally overwhelmed by disaster and is lost. And, there is a well-known local wintry ghostly tale which refers to The Lady in the Snow which is said to have happened on the outskirts of Derry. The story is of two children, a brother and sister who were playing in the snow near a small stream near Enagh Lough. They were making a snowman and gradually they moved closer and closer to the water until they were standing on the ice. A woman dressed in a grey coat and a fur muff approached them, warning them of the danger. She coaxed them back to the bank just as the ice began to crack. She asked where they lived and she advised them to go home. The little girl askedshe could walk home with them andshe could put her hands in the muff to make them warm. The woman put the muff on the little girl and they chatted as they walked. She told them that she had a little girl who went into the water through the ice and warned them to be careful. At the gate she took her muff back and watched them being greeted at the door by their mother. They were both pointing at the lady and gesticulating but the mother saw no one. However she went to the gate because the children were so convinced that a lady had walked home with them. On the snow there were only the footprints of her children. When the snow melted a muff was found near the lake. The little girl knew it was the one that the lady wore.

Ebenezer Scrooge wasnt the first fictional character to see ghosts at this time of year. In fact the tradition probably goes back further than Christmas itself. As the nights grow long and the year creeps towards its close its a natural instinct that people gather together. Its also natural that this time makes us think of people and places that are no longer here. These thoughts have often morphed into tales based on what we encounter at this time of year - winter, death and the eventual rebirth experienced in spring. googletag.cmd.push In Europe this was usually connected to the pagan rituals surrounding the winter solstice known as Yule. The shortest and darkest day of the year was viewed as a time when the dead would have access to the living. The telling of tales at Yuletide began to decline as TV took over as the main form of household entertainment, but it must also be remembered that when Dickens published A Christmas Carol in  the tradition of Christmas itself was also in decline. In fact, for most people in that era Christmas was a working day because the Industrial Revolution meant fewer days off for everyone. As a result, Christmas was considered relatively unimportant and no one really complained. googletag.cmd.push The beginning of disregarding Christmas had come courtesy of Oliver Cromwell around  years earlier. The puritanical Lord Protector of England who in the th Century was “on a mission to cleanse the nation of its most decadent excesses.” These excesses unfortunately included banning Christmas celebrations, its ghostly tales and traditions with even carols making his draconian hit list. Oliver Cromwell is of course remembered in Ireland for his other exploits including the deaths of thousands of people as the result of his orders. But despite his best efforts he failed to quell the traditions of folklore carried over from pre-Christian Ireland. In the Irish tradition, ghosts are called taidhbhse or tais and live in a place halfway between this le and the next. The spirits are held here by some earthly affection or unfulfilled duty or anger against the living. Those who die suddenly, more commonly than others, are believed to become haunting Ghosts. They go about moving the furniture, and in every way trying to attract attention. It was also believed that when the soul has left the body, it is drawn away, sometimes, by the fairies.

For decade upon decade, especially in rural Ireland, New Years Eve was about exactly that - staying in. New Year was never truly a big thing in Ireland - especially for farming communities for who the fortunes of the crops were all important. Irish New Year traditions in agricultural areas, such as they are, are all about the coming twelve months. One belief was that no water could be drawn from the well after the sun went down on New Years Eve. All the water required needed to be inside the house before that and none of it could leave the house until the next day. Defying this belief meant that the family would be faced with a drought in the new year. googletag.cmd.push There was also a tradition that no money could be spent on New Years Day. Nothing could be brought out of a home and anyone visiting should make sure they came bearing a gt. Giving something away meant giving your money away and surely no sensible person would do that. The stroke of midnight on December  carried traditions of its own. Being the first visitor to a house on New Years Day was a popular custom but the warmth of your welcome was largely dependent on the colour of your hair. Unless he arrived empty handed, a dark haired man would be greeted gladly because it was believed that he would bring plenty of good luck. However, a red headed womans arrival meant ill fortune evenher arms were weighed down with all the tokens of what was known as first footing - bread and coal. Red haired females apparently tended to stay at home on New Years Eve. googletag.cmd.push In fact to prevent bad luck, families sometimes sent out a dark haired member of the family immediately after midnight and had them walk back in though the door. All dark haired boys in the area would visit the houses and be welcomed with gts of sweets or money. Anything bad that happened on New Years Eve was considered more signicant the closer it was to midnight. It was believed that there was only a certain amount of luck in the world and everything that could be done to claim a share of it had to be done. It was also important to begin the New Year with a spotlessly clean house signying a fresh start to the New Year. New Years Eve was also known as “Oiacuteche na Coda Moacuteire,”- ‘the night of the big portion’ since people would eat a larger than normal meal to ensure food in plenty for the coming year. Another way of ensuring plenty was to make a cake which was then pounded against the door of the house three times while a prayer was said by the housewe. This would chase the bad luck out of the house and invite the good spirits in. In other areas the man of the house would take three bites out of the cake and then throw it against the front door, in the name of the Trinity and banish hunger from the house. After this the family would then gather up the fragments of the cake and eat it. Many farmers repeated this ceremony at the door of the byre to ensure plentul fodder for the cows. People tried to ensure that no food was taken away from the house on New Years Eve and beggars knew better than to approach a house looking for food. Another New Years Eve Irish tradition was that young girls put mistletoe under their pillows on New Year’s Eve, in hopes of dreaming about their future husband. On New Year’s Eve night, families would remember those who has passed away that year before by setting a place for them at the dinner table and leaving the door unlatched. Anyone entering the house after midnight by the front door would leave by the back door for good luck. Well into the evening on New Years Eve in Ireland there would always be a small group gathered around the fireplace, laughing and joking. Sooner or later, the conversation would turn to reminiscing about Ireland. The old ones, well on their way with a few glasses of the hard stuff, would get all misty-eyed as they remembered times past and the stories would begin in the light of just the fire and candles burning in the windowsill. There was also an Irish tradition of predicting the political future of the country by checking which way the wind blows at midnight on New Year’s Eve. If the wind is from the west, there is a chance that good fortune will reign that year. If the wind is from the east, however, the British will prevail. And,after the stroke of midnight the man of the house would recite the following verse: “May your nets always be full, Your pockets never empty, Your horse not cast a shoe, Nor the devil look at you In the coming year.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

For decade upon decade, especially in rural Ireland, New Years Eve was about exactly that - staying in. New Year was never truly a big thing in Ireland - especially for farming communities for who the fortunes of the crops were all important. Irish New Year traditions in agricultural areas, such as they are, are all about the coming twelve months. One belief was that no water could be drawn from the well after the sun went down on New Years Eve. All the water required needed to be inside the house before that and none of it could leave the house until the next day. Defying this belief meant that the family would be faced with a drought in the new year. googletag.cmd.push There was also a tradition that no money could be spent on New Years Day. Nothing could be brought out of a home and anyone visiting should make sure they came bearing a gt. Giving something away meant giving your money away and surely no sensible person would do that. The stroke of midnight on December  carried traditions of its own. Being the first visitor to a house on New Years Day was a popular custom but the warmth of your welcome was largely dependent on the colour of your hair. Unless he arrived empty handed, a dark haired man would be greeted gladly because it was believed that he would bring plenty of good luck. However, a red headed womans arrival meant ill fortune evenher arms were weighed down with all the tokens of what was known as first footing - bread and coal. Red haired females apparently tended to stay at home on New Years Eve. googletag.cmd.push In fact to prevent bad luck, families sometimes sent out a dark haired member of the family immediately after midnight and had them walk back in though the door. All dark haired boys in the area would visit the houses and be welcomed with gts of sweets or money. Anything bad that happened on New Years Eve was considered more signicant the closer it was to midnight. It was believed that there was only a certain amount of luck in the world and everything that could be done to claim a share of it had to be done. It was also important to begin the New Year with a spotlessly clean house signying a fresh start to the New Year. New Years Eve was also known as “Oiacuteche na Coda Moacuteire,”- ‘the night of the big portion’ since people would eat a larger than normal meal to ensure food in plenty for the coming year. Another way of ensuring plenty was to make a cake which was then pounded against the door of the house three times while a prayer was said by the housewe. This would chase the bad luck out of the house and invite the good spirits in. In other areas the man of the house would take three bites out of the cake and then throw it against the front door, in the name of the Trinity and banish hunger from the house. After this the family would then gather up the fragments of the cake and eat it. Many farmers repeated this ceremony at the door of the byre to ensure plentul fodder for the cows. People tried to ensure that no food was taken away from the house on New Years Eve and beggars knew better than to approach a house looking for food. Another New Years Eve Irish tradition was that young girls put mistletoe under their pillows on New Year’s Eve, in hopes of dreaming about their future husband. On New Year’s Eve night, families would remember those who has passed away that year before by setting a place for them at the dinner table and leaving the door unlatched. Anyone entering the house after midnight by the front door would leave by the back door for good luck. Well into the evening on New Years Eve in Ireland there would always be a small group gathered around the fireplace, laughing and joking. Sooner or later, the conversation would turn to reminiscing about Ireland. The old ones, well on their way with a few glasses of the hard stuff, would get all misty-eyed as they remembered times past and the stories would begin in the light of just the fire and candles burning in the windowsill. There was also an Irish tradition of predicting the political future of the country by checking which way the wind blows at midnight on New Year’s Eve. If the wind is from the west, there is a chance that good fortune will reign that year. If the wind is from the east, however, the British will prevail. And,after the stroke of midnight the man of the house would recite the following verse: “May your nets always be full, Your pockets never empty, Your horse not cast a shoe, Nor the devil look at you In the coming year.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They haven’t released their first album yet but I’m assured it’s on its way.We proved ourselves more than capable of putting ourselves on the map via the Celtronic, Feile, Together, Stendhal, Oscillations and Modulations festivals, not to mention the fundraiser gigs for NICU and the Tuned In Project, great times and great music were had by all. googletag.cmd.push Damien Dempsey came back to Derry for the anniversary of the Civil Rights movement’s most important work.The music and performing arts course in the tech headed up by Rory Donaghy and Grainne McNamaragave itself the credit it deserves and is now living under the new identity MAPA and being rightfully celebrated for training up the musicians and tech-heads that keep our funny wee engine running. Marty Coyle went to Bulgaria as a musician in residence and came back with whole new bag of ingredients for future Balkan Derry work. You were probably in Tinney’s watching them last night and no doubt agree wholeheartedly.Janet Hoy and a group of other artists created “The Stone Tapes” which were sonic representations of the Walls of Derry, the memories trapped in stone can be heard at www.stonetapes. The Clameens played their first live show since disbanding without Doyle at Lisahally in August and promised us nothing really. They came, they saw, they conquered and they’ll let us know the craic sure.The Clameens have sadly aged and now the young punks have taken over. No Collusion are leading the way for independent, frenetic noise and keeping the spirit of Bam Bam  The Calling well and truly alive. Between them, Fast Thursday and Happy Out the punk scene is well and truly flourishing. Rebecca Harkin released “Things Man Be Someway” and Great White Lies released “Chrysalis” and both proved that jazz isn’t as terrible as I thought and, more importantly, the young musicians of Doire and Donegal know a million times more about music than the frequenters of the start of may party.  The late Micky Grfiths who is sadly missed.Keith Harkin continued to soar around America but landed back in Ireland to build and promote his Barn Studios and work with White Denim and The Eagles collaborators. Contact the Barn Studios on Facebook, it’s an absolute treat and the rates are magic.The year belonged to Quiet Arch and the work of Eoin O’Callaghan and Ryan Vail on their “Borders” album. Everything about it came from here, from writing and making, to promoting and videoing. A true triumph of independence that will live forever. It won the album of the year at the NI Music prize and their stablemates Cherym picked up the Oh Yeah Contender award. Sadly this year we lost Eamon Friel in June and his loss is reverberates still, a truly loved, inspiring and cherished foundation of everything musical in Derry left the kind of memories that will outlast us all. Then, in December, Micky Grfiths passed away. Joe Brown said he stopped him from going sane. I can’t think of a more beautul tribute.

The  new entry level paid internships will offer young people the chance to gain real on-the-job experience to kick-start their careers in the creative industries. TheNI Creative Employment Programmewill work with employers to establish brand new posts in order to give people opportunities in thearts and cultural sector. Creative industry businesses in Derry are encouraged to take advantage of this excellent opportunity to add to their teams. Funded by theArts Council of Northern Ireland and Department for Communities, the programme will provide part funding to cover wage costs for employers who create the new jobs and hire a young person aged -. googletag.cmd.push Run by Creative  Cultural Skills NI, the project aims tosupport the next generation of arts and cultural professionals and enable the growth of the sector by directly addressing skills gaps and shortages. “We want to offer greater paid opportunities to young people with the aim of eventually eradicating unpaid internships, which are so prevalent in this sector. Budgets are very tight in this sector so by offering additional funding, this programme will not only help organisations create new, exciting positions but also allow for fairer opportunities to young people,” explained Sarah Jones of Creative  Cultural Skills NI. NICEP ran as a two year pilot programme initially and this highlighted the demand for support by both industry and iniduals with  creative businesses creating  apprentices and paid intern opportunities over that period. googletag.cmd.push Meacuteabh Rooney was a past participant on the programme, securing an internship with the NI Science Festival as a Marketing and Events Intern in . With a university degree in geography, she was working in retail when she spotted the post and applied for it. “The programme gave me a chance to get my first job in the creative sector. I never would have thought of event management as a career but I love it. I was hired back in  and for the upcoming festival and this year they are giving me the opportunity to take the lead in programming two big events so I’m continually learning and developing,” she explained. The organisation also benefitted from the NICEP funding and support. Chris McCreery, director of the Science Festival, explained: “We simply could never have done this without the support. It’s been hugely beneficial to us not just to have an extra team member but to have a new perspective by this smart, engaged young person. She quickly became a valued member of the team who has contributed so much to the festival.” The programme will support new jobs from a wide range of fields including music, dance, drama, literature, visual arts, craft, festivals, arts venues, community arts, galleries, museums, circus and carnival arts but will also accept applications from the wider creative sector including digital, film and TV. Employers looking to grow their staff teams and offer an opportunity to a young person, should contact the NI Creative Employment Programme team for more information. Roisin McDonough, Chief Executive of the Arts Council, said: “We want to encourage our talented young people to see the working in the arts as an attractive career option. The NI Creative Employment Programme was created to provide quality training and mentoring opportunities, to give fair access to careers in the creative and cultural industries, and help bolster the creative sector by harnessing the talent of the next generation.” For more information go towww.ccskills.org.ukor emailnicep@ccskills.org.uk  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The scheme, which will extend for a distance of approximately . kilometres from its junction with the A Tobermore Road to Nutgrove Road, will greatly improve the strength and surface quality of this section of the road network. The carriageway works on the Draperstown Road, Desertmartin will commence on Monday, January  .Given the nature of the scheme and to help ensure the safety of road users and workers, it will be necessary to implement a full road closure for the duration of the works. googletag.cmd.push During the road closure a two-way traffic ersion will be in operation along the A Tobermore Road from Desertmartin to Tobermore and the B Draperstown Road from Tobermore to Draperstown. The Nutgrove Road Tobermore Road junction will also be closed to all traffic. Residents and landowners living along Nutgrove Road should use the Iniscarn Road to access the A Tobermore Road and B Draperstown Road during the duration of this closure. Advanced warning signage for the closure will be provided and ersion routes will be signed as necessary. Local access will be facilitated.Completion of the scheme by Sunday, January  is subject to favourable weather conditions and the Department will keep the public informed of any change. googletag.cmd.push The Department has carefully programmed the works operations and traffic management arrangements in order to minimise any inconvenience to the public, however road users should expect some delays and should allow additional time when planning any journeys. The work was welcomed last week by Sinn Fein councillor Catherine Elattar who has campaigned for the much needed work. She said: At this stage, the work being done will only go as far as the Nutgrove Road, but I am hopeful that as soon as funds become available that the work will be continued along the road to Draperstown. This whole stretch of road needs to be done and we will continue to lobby for this to happen as soon as possible.For traffic information about this and other improvement schemes visit: www.trafficwatchni  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Commenting on the ongoing action, Pat Cullen, Director of the RCN in Northern Ireland said: “Nurses in Northern Ireland are angry that no-one appears to be taking seriously the crisis in our health service. By now, no-one in Northern Ireland, or indeed the rest of the UK, can be in any doubt about the inequalities in health care that people in Northern Ireland are facing. Yet, here we are, a day before Christmas, with the prospect of nursing staff taking strike action again in early January. googletag.cmd.push “We have written to the Secretary of State to say that we are extremely disappointed to learn of the failure of the health summit last week to produce any resolution to the safe staffing and pay parity issues that form the basis of our action. We are also disappointed to hear that attempts to negotiate an agreement leading to the restoration of the devolved institutions has failed. “Although we wish to see political leadership and accountability in Northern Ireland restored, nurses deeply resent the link that is being made between this and resolving the crisis in health care. Sorting out this crisis is a priority regardless of our political situation, which has been in disarray for the past three years. We do not have another three years to wait. googletag.cmd.push “We wonder how much longer this inaction can continue before somebody, somewhere, can take a decision to recty the problems we are facing ”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It has been a horrible festive period for Sean Connor’s men, two home defeats against teams in and around them at the foot of the table making the league table very bleak reading heading into . Even more concerning than the result was the performance again, a disappointing display against Warrenpoint followed up by a lacklustre display that was bereft of confidence, with Carrick gted two early goals to make this and long and fruitless day for the players in blue. googletag.cmd.push ‘Stute now travel to Linfield on New Year’s Day, and they do so level with Warrenpoint at the foot of the table, with only goal dference, and a signicant lack of confidence separating the two sides. Warning signs The warning signs were there for ‘Stute before the opening goal as Carrick looked the brighter of the two teams, Lee Chapman finding himself in a promising shooting position on the edge of the area but he dallied a moment longer than he should have and the shot was charged down. But Carrick, who had failed to score a goal since defeating ‘Stute earlier in the month, got the opener on  minutes when Kyle Cherry linked with Lloyd Anderson in the area and the latter was afforded too much space just six yards from goal, heading into the empty net after Rory Brown had parried his first effort. googletag.cmd.push  Carrick Rangers Stewart Nixon is closed down by Institutes Shaun Leppard. ‘Stute tried to respond but they could well have fallen two goals behind when a long thro into the area led to miscommunication between Brown and Shaun Leppard, with the centre-half flicking a header past his own goalkeeper right across goal with everyone in blue relieved that the ball did not find the net. ‘Stute began to bother Carrick after  minutes and whilst Cormac Burke may have been overly ambitious in his attempt at goal from wide on the left, it did lead to a corner from which Conor Tourish came so close to levelling, his glancing header just wide of the target. Yet just when it seemed that ‘Stute were getting into the game. A mistake at the back cost them dearly as Dean Curry failed to intercept a simple ball and Lee Chapman went clear down the right before firing a low cross to the back post where Reece Neale arrived with a simple tap in for -. ‘Stute boss Sean Connor responded to that by making a substitution after just  minutes, Adam Green on for a clearly disappointed Shaun Leppard. The remainder of the half was all effort without reward for ‘Stute with Joe McCready doing his best to make something happen, but it was Carrick who looked the more dangerous regardless. The visitor came so close to making it - just before the break when Brown hesitated coming off his line and as a result he came off second best in a challenge with Stewart Nixon. The loose ball broke to Chapman in the area and he thought he had scored until young Jack Bradley arrived in the nick of time to clear the ball off the line. Half Time - The introduction of Jamie Dunne just after the break gave ‘Stute some more energy and le in attack, the winger announcing his arrival with a brilliant and determined run into the penalty area before dinking a cross over goalkeeper Ben Nicholl but Joe McCready was unable to capitalise. The greater threat remained with Carrick as the game went on however and when Caolan Loughran headed down into a packed penalty area, the ball was cleared, but only to Neale lurking outside the area and his ambitious effort had to be plucked out of the air by Brown.  Institutes Graham Crown under pressure from Carrick Rangers Lloyd Anderson.  It just never looked like happening for ‘Stute with the energy and endeavour all shown by the players in white and they got the killer goal on  minutes when substitute Guillaume Keke broke down the right, won the race to the ball ahead of goalkeeper Brown and he passed across the face of the empty goal for Stewart Nixon to tap in for a simple but important goal. ‘Stute, to their credit, kept going and good work from McCready carved out a chance for Dunne inside the area, but in a moment which summed up their day, the ball beat Nicholl but rolled the wrong side of the post. It was nonetheless, the closest that ‘Stute came all day,  minutes into the game. ‘Stute’s best chances came when the game was over as a contest, but they could have had a consolation when Cormac Burke crossed for Graham Crown, and his ing header was just past the upright, much to the midfielder’s disappointment.  FINAL WHISTLE Man of the MatchReece Neale scored a fine second goal and was eager to add to his tally throughout. He added a real attacking dimension to the Carrick attack, and he did so from full back. Moment of the MatchThe first goal in this one was always going to be signicant especially for the confidence boost it would give, and it deservedly went to Carrick after an energetic start. Lloyd Anderson needed two attempts before he got his goal but he was in so much space it hardly mattered. Key BattleJoe McCready never let his head drop, and when he got the ball he was always looking to make things happen. Mark Surgeoner was kept on his toes as a result in what was an interesting battle between the striker and the defender.

The principal cast performed like seasoned professionals, bringing the iconic characters to le with flair and panache.Eoin McGuinness and Ellen McGurnaghan were outstanding in their comic portrayals of Gomez and Morticia Addams, while Annie Haughey and Eoin Moore were superb as the sinister siblings, Wednesday and Pugsley.The hilariously embarrassing grandmother was played by Aisha Oladipupo, and Year  student Conaire Laverty brought endless laughs as the grunting Lurch. Conn Murnin, as Uncle Fester, was a particular audience favourite and his departure on a rocket to seek the love of his le mdash the Moon mdash was a highlight of the show.The ever present long dead Addams ancestors were a tight and focused chorus including a stunning range of costumes from cavemen to flappers. All-American family, the Beinekes, played by Malachy McGrady, Elisha Tumelty and Tomaacutes Harkinleft the audience in stitches as they struggled to deal with ways of the weird and wonderful Addams family. All ended happily ever after, however, as both families moved towards the darkness and embraced who they really were.Featuring an exceptional live orchestra led by Head of Music Celeste McEvoy and music teacher Ciara Coleman, and with magnicent set, costume, lighting and sound complementing the breathtaking musical and dramatic talent of these students, it really was a show not to be missed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Post Office remains  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Ballynahinch will continue to have access to a first class Post Office service in the New Year after all.Days after it was suggested that the current office in Lisburn Street would close temporarily on January , it was confirmed this week that there will be no break in service.The current postmistress will vacate her position on January  with M Retail Ltd taking over the service the following day.Mrs Donna Carlisle mdash who is the current postmistress mdash said everything will continue as normal in the New Year and that there will be no interruption to services.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who said last week that it was his understanding that the Ballynahinch Post Office was to close temporarily, is delighted that normal service is to continue.He said post offices are at the heart of communities and are used by a wide range of people, in particular the elderly, who enjoy the face-to-face contact with staff.ldquoBallynahinch is the districtrsquos third largest town and I am pleased that there will be no interruption to postal services, he continued.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices rather than banks.

The boys are all training hard and we are working on a few dferent permutations for the decider, but it will definitely be horses for courses.ldquoTony McIlhone, Jack McLaughlin and Adam and Gareth George will be key for us in the final. Their experience should stand us in good stead, but I have absolutely no doubt that our young players will rise to the occasion, he added.Fitzsimmons paid tribute to Gerard Kelly, who led the team, to Harry Clarke Cup success last season with Kieran Sharvin and who is still in the management team.ldquoIt is a pleasure and honour to work alongside Gerard, who puts so much effort into keeping the club going. We have been friends for many years and work so well together, he said.ldquoWe have come up with a few ideas on how to get at Ballynahinch Olympic, but we will leave that information to the changing rooms in Meadowvale.Barry McGoran and Marty Sloan have moulded Ballynahinch Olympic Town into a force to be reckoned with, despite the fact that they rarely field with the same  every week due to first team call-ups.As a reserve team, people tend to write them off in the big games, but theyrsquove consistently proved that theyrsquore good enough to compete with anyone.The squad has done exceptionally well to get to another final, but they wont be happy until they get our hands on the cup.McGoran and Sloan like to play the same way as Killough and use the tactic of attack being the best means of defence and Barry feels that Olympic arenrsquot far away from lting the trophy.ldquoWersquore only half way there and need to stay focused. We got a bit carried away last year, but wersquove learnt from that. We need calm heads now, hesaid.ldquoKillough will go into the final as favourites.

In addition, roads officials only have eight electricians to repair faulty street lights across the Province, with just five of these working full-time.The crisis facing street lighting repairs has been highlighted this week by South Down MLA Colin McGrath who has been contacted by many concerned residents across the constituency.He said that the government departmentrsquos failure to sanction work to repair street lights mdash which includes replacing faulty wiring and defective bulbs mdash is a major concern for many, in particular, the vulnerable and elderly.Mr McGrath said that while the issue may appear trivial and mundane to some, to a signicant number of others, itrsquos literally is a matter of personal safety.He said many are fearful of injuring themselves due to faulty street lights which plunge areas around their home into darkness.The MLA declared: ldquoThere is barely a street or road in South Down that does not have street lights which are not working. When there are several defective lights in a row, this creates problems.Mr McGrath said that he and his colleagues have been ldquoinundated with repair requests which are passed on to the departmentrsquos street lighting team.He said that while he is full of admiration for the local team who work tirelessly to resolve faulty streetlights in a professional and courteous way, they can only work with the budget they have been given, one which he said falls well short of what is required.ldquoI have written to the Department for Infrastructure and have found out that the budget for street lighting should be poundm a year. It is currently a mere poundm which is totally inadequate and falls well short of what the public expect, declared Mr McGrath.ldquoApparently, there are only eight full time staff managing the work of replacing and fixing street lights across the whole of North and this is wholly unacceptable. Eight staff from Derry toNewry, and Enniskillen to Ballycastle is not enough and represents a situation that demands action.The MLA confirmed that he has also raised his concerns with the permanent secretary at the helm of the government department asking that in the depths of winter and reduced daylight hours, additional funding will be made to address the issue.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are literally in the dark over what will happen next and need to see some solution to this problem.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed that officials have discussed the street lighting situation with Mr McGrath.ldquoWhilst we appreciate his concerns, we have explained that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continues to face budget challenges and resources are not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service, she continued.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos current budget for street lighting repairs is approximately poundm, which is much lower than the pound.m that would be required to provide a full street lighting repair service.The spokeswoman explained that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce, which consists of five full time and three part time electricians.She added: ldquoDue to the restricted service, outages may take much longer than usual to be repaired, with priority being given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Devaney.jpg","title":"Devaney elected as new chairman of Down GAA  ","story":"DOWN GAA elected a new chairman at the annual convention in Newry last Wednesday evening.

But it is only the only project.ldquoThere is quite a lot we can achieve in other areas, on and off the fields of play. Coaching, refereeing, administration, club development and fundraising will also require our attention, he added.ldquoAnd we also want to have the ambition for our teams to reach their potential and challenge for honours. So, the future has real potential for us, but it will require a lot of support, goodwill and a unity of purpose across the county.

Muriel worked in the office of the now defunct Ulster Transport company.They met on a bus from Belfast to Portaferry and the rest, as they say, is history.ldquoI think we were both on the bus from Belfast and my mother, who knew Muriel, sat beside her and they began to talk and then we were introduced, said Alan. ldquoI was sitting behind and my mother then invited her down for supper the next night.Muriel interjected jokingly: ldquoI was supposed to be going to a shorthand class, which would have made my dear father much happier, but I mitched off and went to the Ritz pictures instead.ldquoHis mother had already spotted me and approved me as a likely candidate for her son as she believed that I knew how to keep house since I was doing it at home as my mother died when I was very young.Alan said that his motherrsquos approval of Muriel very much matched his own.ldquoI had clapped eyes on her before and I thought she will do very nicely for me. It was a private thought, but my mother must have picked up on it and had some insight, he added.Muriel did come for supper the next night and an invitation to a dance was given by Alan. They courted for over a year and more whenever he was home on leave.Alanrsquos parents, Rachel and Ian, were in the next room when Alan later asked Muriel to marry him and they celebrated with tea and supper again.ldquoI was completely flabbergasted but I would say that it was a romantic proposal, recalled Muriel. ldquoAlanrsquos father was great at tending to an open fire in the sitting room and his mother was a great hostess in making scones and cake for supper, so I think just after his father tended the fire, Alan turned tome and asked me to marry me. I think I said yes with a laugh as it was so unexpected.The couple spent the early years of their marriage in Malta where Alan was stationed and where the eldest two sons where born.While the family spent a short time living in Bangor, they have spent the last  years living Downpatrick where Alan went on to work for Radio Rentals in the town, and later in the British Red Cross Society in Belfast, while Muriel worked for the Saul playgroup and later in Downpatrick Library.The couplersquos love of music and going to the theatre, both in Belfast, and at the former Theatre Upstairs, in Irish Street, Downpatrick, was a shared passion over the years.Even today, they both love to watch or listen to concerts on the radio or TV, with performances perking up them up from a trying day or calling on their Alexa to play some Glen Miller music.Muriel said: ldquoWe both love the theatre and we both absolutely love music of all sorts. If therersquos anything that doesnrsquot suit us, we have a wee word with Alexa and say itrsquos your turn to chose.Alan added: ldquoIrsquove often said isnrsquot it wonderful that we have the same tastes in common and thatrsquos a great start to a marriage as well as a good sense of humour and a short memory.Muriel said: ldquoI think it did help that we did like the same things but I would say donrsquot leave it too long before you say sorry for whatever may have happened or been said between you.

Cllr Enrightrsquos assertion has been rejected by council officials.ldquoThe long-standing plans to publicly finance the redevelopment of public lands in Downpatrick town centre have been abandoned, he claimed.Cllr Enright said business representatives who attended the meeting in Downpatrick were not informed that a proposed road linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of a new one-way system was not proceeding.He said such a scheme mdash which roads officials have said is not viable given the cost and the small impact that it would have on congestion mdash would have eliminated the need for traffic lights on all the main junctions and ldquomassively reduced congestion around the centre of town.Cllr Enright claimed that when he queried the decision, he was informed that the councilrsquos priorities are the Ballynahinch bypass and Newryrsquos southern relief road.He added: ldquoAll this comes hot on the heels of the scandalous proposed closure of Downpatrickrsquos visitor information centre in favour of Newry, progressing greenways around Newry but not Downpatrick and the abandonment of the promised Edward Street one-way system, which was supposed to have been delivered on a short-term basis in  until the new council revisited the roads priority list.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman said the local authority has allocated poundm to the Newry City Centre regenerationproject, with poundm secured from the Belfast Regional City Deal, not the poundm quoted by Cllr Enright.She continued: ldquoIt has been proposed that the development of Downpatrick town centre and the old PSNI station should be done collaboratively between local and central government with intervention from other public sector bodies.ldquoThis remains the case. However, the one-way system for Downpatrick town centre was considered by Transport NI who have advised that this is not viable.The spokeswoman also confirmed that a report was tabled to the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourismlast month which considered the future opportunities for visitor information centres within the district.She added: ldquo This report was held lsquoin committeersquo and no decisions have been made by Newry, Mourne and Down Council with regards to the closures of existing visitor information centres.

He has said before that he doesnrsquot have the authority, yet he made the last offer.She stressed that none of the union members wanted to take strike action but felt compelled to do so as a last resort.Speaking as her union entered the fourth week of industrial action, she said: ldquoThe fact that Unison, RCN, Unite and NIPSA are all taking strike action today reinforces the fact that health care staff feel passionately about the preservation of the NHS and want to restore it to a service that they can be proud of again and will last for generations to come.ldquoAgain we ask the public to support us as they have previously and join us in the fight to restore our health service to a high standard.She called on recently elected MPs to fulfil their promises of support at last weekrsquos strike and added: ldquoWe look to our local MLAs, Department of Health officials and the Secretary of State to address these issues now.She said that Unison would like to thank local businesses which provided the striking staff with food and refreshments during this time, in particular Molloyrsquos in Downpatrick  A in Crossgar, and Down Community Health Committee members for their support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Sinn.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein\u0027s candidate sails home on night of drama at Titanic Centre  ","story":"THE re-election of Chris Hazzard largely went under the radar at last weekrsquos election count in Belfast.Originally due to take place in Magherafelt, the South Down count was switched to the Titanic Exhibition Centre in Belfast in the shadow of the iconic Harland and Wolff shipyard and its imposing Sampson and Goliath cranes which dominate the city skyline.The mainstream media effectively ignored the South Down contest in the run-up to last weekrsquos election and, during the counting of votes across six constituencies in the huge Titanic centre, it was more of the same.Predictably, the media focus was on the North and South Belfast seats where DUP heavyweights Nigel Dodds and Emma Little-Pengelly lost out to Sinn Feinrsquos John Finucane and the SDLPrsquos Claire Hanna respectively.Television cameras were focused on the reaction of the winners and losers in the Belfast constituencies and the arrival of DUP leader Arlene Foster mdash on what was a particularly dficult night for her party mdash and Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald and the republican partyrsquos northern leader Michelle OrsquoNeill.Mr Hazzard, who made history two years ago when he broke the SDLPrsquos -year stranglehold on the South Down seat, was officially declared the winner shortly before .am, but his acceptance speech was brief. As was that of SDLP runner-up Michael Savage.They were the only two South Down candidates who made their way to the podium to thank those who voted for them on a night when Northern Irelandrsquos political environment changed signicantly.With voters across the province electing a majority of nationalist MPs for the first time, it truly was a night of edge-of-the-seat political drama. Itrsquos often said that first itrsquos news then its history, but at the Belfast county centre news and history were inextricably intertwined.Minutes after the South Down result had been declared, the glare of the media spotlight was on official confirmation that the DUP had lost South Belfast.As SDLP supporters and the party faithful cheered loudly for Claire Hanna, the Sinn Fein contingent took a moment out of celebrating Mr Hazzardrsquos victory to watch proceedings.Hazzard was always the favourite for the South Down seat and used a sporting analogy to explain how he felt about the contest. He said favourites donrsquot always win, pointing out how hard he worked on the ground, emphasising that the was never complacent about the challenge he faced from the SDLP.From early in the count, SDLP members said that it looked as though their man was in with a real fighting chance and from the boxes which had been opened, the duo were neck and neck.While some of the Sinn Fein contingent appeared to be sporting furrowed brows early into the counting process, they were always confident that their man would emerge victorious and that he did, albeit with a reduced majority.There were suggestions that unionist voters in the Crossgar area had backed Mr Savage, who was clear throughout his campaign that he would not only be an MP for all, but one who would take his seat in the House of Commons.And while it was reported close between him and Mr Hazzard at one stage, the Sinn Fein man eased ahead in the race to cross the winning line, with the SDLP man left wondering what might have been.He had been given a relatively short lead-in time to last weekrsquos parliamentary pole and while pleased with his performance, he clearly felt he could have done even better and pushed the Sinn Fein man all the way to the line.Elsewhere, Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was one of a number of his partyrsquos candidates who built on their recent success at the EU and local council elections.The Westminster poll was viewed as a key litmus test that would rigorously challenge Alliancersquos recent election surge in a first past the post electoral system which did not rely on the votes of other parties.Mr Brown, who in May trebled his Newry, Mourne and Down Council vote in Rowallane, was at it again. His election agent and fellow councillor, Andrew McMurray, stood for Alliance in  and polled , votes, but Brown more than trebled the Alliance vote, a performance which helped his party leapfrog the Ulster Unionists to become the third largest in the province. Overall, Alliancersquos vote in South Down increased by an impressive . per cent, marking a remarkable performance by Brown.Most signicantly, Alliance now has its eyes focused firmly on securing an Assembly seat and while Mr Brown refused to be drawn on whether he would like his name to go forward should such a contest arise, there is no doubt that he will be the partyrsquos preferred candidate. He left the count centre a happy man his stock within his party continues to rise.Elsewhere, the DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna was pleased with his performance, despite his vote decreasing, and he didnrsquot rule out being the partyrsquos flag bearer in a future Assembly electionthis weekrsquos talks at Stormont fail to restore the power-sharing executive.Ulster Unionist, Jill Macauley, defied pundits suggestions that her party would not do well in South Down, by increasing the UUP vote by almost three per cent.Province-wide, the UUP polled , votes but with a new leader in charge the party did not produce the performance it had been hoping for. However, Mrs Macauley provided it with a glimmer of hope with her performanceAontuacute mdash which was contesting its first election mdash polled , votes but party candidate, Paul Brady, wasnrsquot at the count centre in Belfast where party leader Peader Tobin did call late on Thursday evening.As the last of the media interviews were conducted, television and radio sound engineers were doing their best to drown out the clatter of chairs being piled on top of one another and folding tables used by counting staff collapsed to be packed away.The last of the candidates, party supporters, election staff and the media started to drt away from the Titanic Exhibition Centre around .am, following another night of high drama which signicantly reshaped the provincersquos political landscape..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Special.jpg","title":"Special gift for Lorcán  ","story":"CHRISTMAS came early for Downpatrick toddler Lorcaacuten Maguire who received his first dose of le-extending medication yesterday.His parents have been campaigning to get the expensive drug Orkambi free on the NHS since Lorcaacuten, who has Cystic Fibrosis , was just a few months old.Brave Lorcaacuten, who turns three next month, took his drug at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with the help of some strawberry-flavoured milk.However, it was a bittersweet moment for his mother, Jen Banks, as she knows that other parents of children are still patiently waiting for the drug to became available.She said: ldquoLast Christmas I was dreaming about getting Orkambi but it was a dream that would have meant leaving my home, family, and our amazing NHS to move to the south.ldquoThis year on Christmas morning Lorcaacuten will open his stocking and before he opens the rest of his presents, he will have his morning dose of Orkambi with a few segments of chocolate orange. I am so joyful and thankful as is my husband Dermot and our families.Orkambi was made available freely available following a surprise move by Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly at the end of October.Scotland and the Republic of Ireland made the drug free available to CF sufferers earlier but NHS England wrangled with the drug company over price.Once a deal was agreed in England, it paved the pay for Northern Ireland to introduce Orkambi for patients as young as Lorcaacuten, along with Symkevi, which can be given to children aged  and over.Jen was only informed on Monday that the drug was available for Lorcaacuten following a phone call from his treatment nurse.She said: ldquoI was absolutely shaking holding the phone when they told me that Lorcaacuten could get his medication as he has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last November.ldquoOrkambi was being given to those children with the higher clinical need and Lorcaacuten got it because of his infection, but I know of so many other families who have campaigned long and hard as we have.ldquoItrsquos just a matter of sufficient quantities of the drug becoming available as I know that the medical teams are working around the clock to distribute to as many patients as they can.Lorcaacuten was observed for five hours in hospital before he was allowed to go home with what his mother calls his ldquomagic medicine. He will need to take it twice daily from now as well as taking his antibiotics and being nebulised several times a day.However, Jen says that studies have shown that children with CF who take Orkambi from the age of six can live with the condition for an extra  years.ldquoThis is not just a Christmas present for this year, but for all the extra years we hope to have with Lorcaacuten, said Jen.ldquoWhilst I love Lorcaacuten to the bottom of my heart, these past three years have been very dficult.

He said: “The Prime Minister’s speech was heard in respectful silence but the Taoiseach’s speech was marred by some ill-mannered sighs, groans and chattering from unionist delegrations which degenerated at the end into actual interruptions.”Unionists objected to the proceedings being jointly chaired by the British and Irish governments, with an eventual acceptance by Dublin that the secretary of state would act as interim chairman until a decision on a permanent chair.“The SDLP were in grim mood and determined to press for George Mitchell for chairman on the basis of an unchanged agenda and procedural guidelines.”The DUP and UKUP were strongly opposed to Mitchell on two grounds. First, they did not agree with the role he would enjoy and the powers that went with it.“Second, and more crucial in their view, was the fact that he was fatally compromised in unionist eyes because of his background and the way that his appointment had been acclaimed by the Irish government and Sinn Fein.“At this stage the mood of McCartney and Paisley was friendly, jolly and courteous, a condition which did not last.“The UUP had objections to Mitchell which were similar, but in their case the powers and procedures that he would operate under were much more prevalent than their reservations about his backgrounds, which had, to a large extent, been assuaged by personal contact between Mitchell and Trimble.“Their attitude and position was also complicated by all too obvious concerns about being outflanked by Paisley and stirrings within their own party.“Pulling in another direction, however, was Trimble’s evident huge enjoyment about being involved in negotiations which, I believe, contributed to a strong personal reluctance to walk away.Declassied Files: Labour planned to put NI on an involuntary path to Irish unity Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The Alliance were in deepest gloom. They had been very depressed, though perhaps not surprised, by the procedural wrangling which had, so far, totally dominated events.”Mr Howard said that the Irish government “acquiesced in the subordinate role they played” in the meetings, “though they evidently did not like it”.He said that towards the end of the day “it became clear thatwe were to keep the UUP in the process it would be necessary to address their concern about the procedural rules.” It was accepted that a deal which brought in the UUP would probably not be enough to retain the DUP and UKUP but the judgment of both governments and the independent chairmen was that in such circumstances the talks would remain viable.”The following day the governments tabled proposals for amended procedures and the parties then entered bilateral negotiations with each other, the governments and the chairmen.“After a huge row with the Irish government, the SDLP very reluctantly accepted that this was the best on offer. The DUP and the UKUP effectively rejected it ... in the end and as expected, it came down to trying to do a deal with the UUP.“Their initial reaction to the paper was that it had some good elements in it but the order needed to be changed [appointing a committee first to finalise the rules before appointing a plenary chairman].“However, the Secretary of State said he intended to press ahead with the proposal as it had been tabled.“Trimble at that stage said that this was unacceptable. The Secretary of State said that ... in those circumstances [he] would have little option but to conclude that the talks were not viable [and] suspend them.“A consequence of that, of course, would be that there would be no Forum. This evinced some horried looks, particularly from Geoffrey [sic] Donaldson and a physical mental gulp from Trimble who, nevertheless, said ‘So be it’.“By pm, he said that the Secretary of State had concluded that it was ‘the end of the process’ and “we reported to the Prime Minister suggesting that the only card remaining was a direct call from him to Trimble.“Events then took an extraordinary turn. Very shortly after his meeting with the Secretary of State, Trimble asked to see Senator Mitchell and at . presented a compromise proposal to the Secretary of State, saying that he would be prepared to accept Mitchell as chairman, provided that the interim rules under which he operated were not those of  June, but those which applied during the   talks.“The Secretary of State believed that this was a major concession and the next few hours were spent trying desperately to sell it to the Irish Government and the SDLP.“For a while this showed signs of being fruitless with Hume effectively saying that he and his party had already moved enough in the direction of unionist concerns and would move no further and the Irish showing an overwhelming and inexplicable solitude for the dignity of the three independent chairman [sic], effectively suggesting that it would be best for everyonewe were to cut our losses and move out of the process.” However, he said that “then news filtered up about another almost unprecedented event in the shape of direct negotiations between Irish ministersand David Trimble. .”He said that for several hours that left the British side “in the unaccustomed position of having to twiddle its thumbs while the Irish and the UUP tried to come to terms”.That ended when the tanaiste appeared “clutching a piece of paper... representing an agreement between the Irish, the UUP and the SDLP”.By now it was almost midnight and “Dr Paisley and his colleagues became increasingly loud and belligerent, at one time threatening to burst into the Secretary of State’s office”.When informed that a deal had been done, there were “loud shouts of protests and Paisley, McCartney and their teams stormed out”.Eventually, after midnight, Senator Mitchell took over as chairman and faced a barrage from Dr Paisley who then led the DUP out.Martin Howard said: “In  months as a private secretary I have been privileged to be part of, or witness to, a number of extraordinary events, but I think the last two days has topped them all.“More than once, the whole enterprise was on the point of failure and, in accordance with normal practice in Northern Irish political affairs, was only saved in the small hours of the morning ... most extraordinary of all was the fact that the final deal was done between the Irish government and David Trimble.”He added: “Finally, the other great success has been leaving Sinn Fein literally, and metaphorically, out in the cold. Their attempt to gain entry into the talks on Monday failed to gain them the public confrontation which they had sought and their demonstrations on Tuesday and Wednesday attracted minimal media

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos momentous to have these letters coming out.Hale and Eliot were lelong friends who exchanged letters for about  years, beginning in .The pair met in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in  but did not rekindle their friendship until .Eliot was already living in England and Hale taught drama at US universities, including Scripps College in Calornia.In , Hale donated the letters under an agreement that they would not be opened until  years after either her or Eliotrsquos death, whichever came second. Eliot died in , Hale four years later.Biographers say Eliot ordered Halersquos letters to him to be burned. --Emily Hale and TS Eliot pose in a  family photo in Dorset, Vermont  --Their relationship ldquomust have been incredibly important and their correspondence must have been remarkably intimate for him to be so concerned about the publication, said Mr Cuda.TS Eliot was born in St Louis, Missouri, in  and gained notoriety as a poet early in le. He was only  when The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock became his first professionally published poem.His best known works include The Waste Land, The Hollow Men and Four Quartets.The first poem in the Quartets series, called Burnt Norton, piques the interest of enthusiasts of the poet, says Eliot scholar Frances Dickey, because of lines that suggest missed opportunities and what might have been with his muse.The poem is named after a home in England that Eliot visited with Hale in . ldquoHis relationship with her seems to be deep and meaningful and itrsquos a door he chose not to open, said Ms Dickey.The letters could also reveal details about Eliotrsquos conversion to Anglicanism, something he deeply cherished, she added.Ms Dickey, who was one of the editors of The Complete Prose of TS Eliot, said the poet was deeply ashamed of his marriage to his first we, Vivienne Haigh-Wood, who he was with for more than  years.She said the letters could reveal just how close he and Hale were andthe two ever considered marriage.ldquoWas this an epistolary romance they would carry across the Atlantic  said Ms Dickey. ldquoWhat role did she play in his emotional le Eliotrsquos letters to Hale began after that first marriage ended.Whatever  she was, Hale was a link to the le Eliot had left behind in the United States as a young man, Ms Dickey said.ldquoHe was really thinking more about the United States and his childhood during the period where he was in correspondence with Hale, she said. ldquoI have a feeling that having a relationship with an American woman helped him to uncover his past in a way.
