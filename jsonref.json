Photograph: Cyril ByrneA record 84,000 students have applied for college places in the coming academic year, according to well-placed sources, placing further pressure on the third-level entry system.Last February the Central Applications Office (CAO) received a record 79,000 applications for college places, a 9 per cent increase on 2020.This figure has since climbed by several thousand since the deadline for late applications passed on May 1st, according to education sources.The increase is likely to be the result of mature students seeking to retrain and increased interest from overseas applicants sparked by Brexit.Government sources say they hope the addition of about 4,000 extra third-level places this year will absorb pressure linked to growing demand and grade inflation as a result of the new accredited grades process.Details of where the additional places will go are still being worked out, but senior sources want to target them in areas of demand such as health, law, business, science, the environment and journalism.These issues are due to be discussed by Ministers at a meeting of the Cabinet committee on education this week, which includes Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris, Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and others.However, higher education sources have warned that places in very high demand courses such as medicine, dentistry and engineering have “maxed out” due to a combination of physical constraints and limited clinical placements.“We simply can’t accommodate any more applicants to these types of courses,” said one senior third-level source.“We don’t have the lab space, we don’t have access to additional clinical places, so I don’t see where these places can go. The danger is that we end up creating additional places in other courses where the demand isn’t really needed.”Grade inflationTensions are also emerging between the Government and universities over the funding of additional third-level places generally.One higher-education source said that although the Government wanted a new baseline of third-level places based on 2,225 additional third-level places created last year, this was being resisted by colleges.“We will do everything we can to facilitate students, but we can’t plan our higher education in this kind of on-the-hoof way. We need to ask: how many students should be going to third level, are they going there for the right reasons and what alternatives are there?”Grade inflation is expected among this year’s Leaving Cert students because they have the option of receiving accredited grades based on teachers’ estimated marks – similar to last year’s calculated grades – or sitting written exams, or both.If a student chooses to avail of accredited grades and the written exam, they will automatically receive the better result. The vast majority of sixth-year students have opted to sit exams and receive accredited grades in a number of subjects.Last year’s calculated grades process resulted in grade inflation and a major increase in CAO points. This led to additional pressure on places in high-demand courses where there were limited places.Under pressureSome observers believe grade inflation could be even greater this year due to the fact that most students will\u0026nbspautomatically be credited with their best result.Increased demand for college this year and the pressure on particular courses became clear in a breakdown of CAO applications by the regular February 1st deadline.This showed there was particular pressure for places on high-points courses in areas such as health sciences and environmental studies.Some colleges recorded an exceptional demand for places. For example, Trinity College Dublin recorded a record 38 per cent increase in first-preference applications, while University College Dublin recorded a 16 per cent increase.In light of additional demand, Simon Harris set up a working group to identify spare capacity in the higher-education system, which has been examining how many more places can be offered across high-demand courses.It is understood that engagement is taking place with health services, in particular, to see if additional clinical placements can be provided to help boost numbers in these sectors."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Centres projected to require a third of Ireland\u0026rsquos generated energy within a decadeRevenue in any EU-wide permit scheme ought to accrue to national governmentsEnvironmentalist warns scale-up of Ireland\u0026rsquos offshore wind resources could be undone by lack of public engagement"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top five cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high risk (cohort 4) and those aged 60 to 69 (cohort 5).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be\u0026nbsppeople\u0026nbspaged 16 to 64 who are at high risk (cohort 7).

He did not rule out a potential renewal at a later stage.Concerns have risen on potential side-effects of the Anglo-Swedish Covid-19 vaccine.Europe’s medicines regulator said on Friday it is reviewing reports of a rare nerve-degenerating disorder in people who received the shots, a move that comes after it found the vaccine may have caused very rare blood clotting cases.While the regulator has maintained that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh any risks, several European countries have limited use to older age groups or suspended use altogether.New contractIn answer to a question at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, French president Emmanuel Macron welcomed the move towards what he sees are more effective vaccines against new variants of Covid-19, calling it “pragmatic”. “But for future orders, in order to respond in particular to variants, we see that other vaccines are now more effective, so this signals a European pragmatism which I welcome.”The European Union signed a new contract with Pfizer-BioNTech to receive 1.8 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines for 2021-2023, to cover booster shots, donations and reselling of doses, the European Commission said on Friday.An increase in prices for second generation vaccines could be justified by the extra research required and potential changes to industrial equipment, Breton said.“There may be a little extra cost but I will let the competent authorities unveil it in due course,” he told France Inter radio. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Covid lockdown roadmap: the rules that could change from May 17Rescuers work into the night to save whale stranded in River ThamesSeven people shot dead after gunman opens fire at Colorado birthday partyAngela Rayner claims victory in Sir Keir Starmer\u0026#39s chaotic reshuffleForget the thwack of leather on willow, bamboo could make the best cricket batFree lateral flow tests may not be OK for departing green list holidaymakersBoris Johnson ready to confirm the return of indoor socialising and dining from May 17 Comment: Sir Keir Starmer isn’t the solution to the Labour Party’s crisis, he’s the causeBoris Johnson ready to recommit to a social care overhaul in the Queen’s SpeechComment: Labour will keep on losing if it does not find answersBoris Johnson expected to top list of Tory MPs under investigation by parliament\u0026#39s sleaze watchdog\u0026#39Dogecoin is a hustle\u0026#39: Elon Musk sends his \u0026#39fav\u0026#39 cryptocurrency tumbling on Saturday Night Live Local election results 2021: how your council voted and how the numbers map across EnglandMay 2021 election results: the maps, charts and data of how your area voted across the UKLondon mayoral election results 2021: Sadiq Khan re-elected for second term Scottish election results 2021: the charts and maps that show how Scotland votedNicola Sturgeon tells Boris Johnson that Indyref2 is a matter of \u0026#39when, not if\u0026#39Search all monuments for slavery links, Church of England tells parishesPursuit of Love star Emily Beecham on feeling \u0026#39unsafe\u0026#39 during sex scenes Is it now time to lift Covid restrictions?

At some point it may become unviable to grow them, she and other horticulturists and scientists at Kew believe.Traditional potatoes are becoming very hard to grow because of blight, she said.Two strange-looking, knobbly little roots are being trialed instead, as they fare better in a warm climate and are resistant to blight.The gardener explained: We have been trying to grow root vegetables that could be substituted in the future. One we grow is oculus tuberosa, and tropaeolum tuberosum - the former is a little lemony root, it does really well, we are breeding it in the UK to make it more suitable for our climate. We also have a mustardy root crop, and sweet potatoes are doing well as well. They could be a replacement. We won’t know for tens of years but we have to start somewhere.Many who tried to grow lettuces during last year\u0027s heatwave will have noticed it was an uphill battle. These hot summers are becoming more common, so Ms Dove is working to find hardier alternatives to the salad crop.She said: Lettuces bolt when it gets hot so we may not be able to grow them in hot dry summers. We are growing tropical leaves, orache, tree spinach, they are traditionally grown for their grain but the leaves are edible so they sort of replace spinach. We are also growing dandelion which have really bitter but delicious leaves. They will keep growing through anything. We are trialling all this for salad in the kitchen garden. Another new way of gardening she is experimenting with is container planting, for those who do not have vegetable patches but want to grow their own food.In the kitchen garden, she is growing a new breed of butternut squash which can fit in a pot, and a mini peach tree which will produce a handful of fruits each year.Ms Dove explained: The windowsill crops and container planting are a real trend at the moment - we are developing butternut squashes you can grow in a pot - usually they need a lot of room but these work in a pot. We are in conversation with people to get smaller cultivars to try to get crops that often need a lot of space. I am trialling dwarf peaches and dwarf nectarines that can be grown in a pot. I have this beautiful little tree that will give me 10 peaches this year. People are realising they don’t need a big space to grow something.

ocean","story":"Remnants of a Chinese rocket crashed into the Indian Ocean on Sunday in one of the largest uncontrolled re-entries of a spacecraft in history. No one is believed to have been injured, but the incident prompted NASA to criticise China for “failing to meet responsible standards regarding their space debris” and a lack of transparency. People in Jordan, Oman and Saudi Arabia reported spotting the debris in the dawn skies, which crashed into the ocean at 0224 GMT near the Males, according to coordinates reported by Chinese state media. China’s space agency said that most of the core section of its Long March 5B rocket burned up on re-entry into Earth\u0027s atmosphere.The news ended days of speculation about where debris from the rocket\u0027s core section, which was 30 metres long and 21 tonnes heavy, would land.Chinese state media had dismissed worries that the rocket was out of control and could cause damage as “Western hype”.But NASA’s administrator, Bill Nelson, said in a statement: “China is failing to meet responsible standards regarding their space debris”.“Spacefaring nations must minimize the risks to people and property on Earth of re-entries of space objects and maximize transparency regarding those operations,” said Mr Nelson, a former senator and astronaut. “It is critical that China and all spacefaring nations and commercial entities act responsibly and transparently in space to ensure the safety, stability, security, and long-term sustainability of outer space activities.”While the debris was most likely to land on water – which covers most of the Earth’s surface – it could have potentially landed at any point as far north as Beijing, Madrid and New York, and as far south as southern Chile and Wellington in New Zealand.  “An ocean reentry was always statistically the most likely,” said Harvard astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell on Twitter. “It appears China won its gamble… But it was still reckless.”He said it was the joint fourth biggest uncontrolled re-entry on record. Most countries have tried to design their spacecrafts to avoid uncontrolled re-entries since large chunks of the NASA space station Skylab fell from orbit and landed in Australia in 1979. It makes the Chinese rocket designers look lazy that they didn\u0027t address this, Mr McDowell told Reuters.While the module separated from the launcher to continue its journey as planned, the launch vehicle’s core section also reached orbit.China’s military-backed space programme has not explained why the section didn’t fall back to earth soon after separating from its payload, which is usual in such operations.  The Long March 5B’s first launch in May last year also ended with an uncontrolled re-entry.Debris from what had been an 18-tonne core section passed over the US and landed in the Atlantic Ocean off West Africa, with pieces also damaging several buildings in the Ivory Coast. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and

theories that Neanderthals indulged in ritual cannibalism – instead pointing to the prospect that they were eaten by giant hyenas.The skull was one of thousands of fossilised bones and bone fragments found in the large cave near the village of San Felice Circeo, on the Tyrrhenian coast about half-way between Rome and Naples.The skull has a hole at its base, leading archaeologists to suggest that it was the work of hyenas, gnawing at the bone to get at the brains inside.They say they cannot be sure whether the hyenas tracked and killed the Neanderthals, dragging them into the cave, or whether they were scavenging on people who had already died inside the cave of some other cause.Back in 1939, a similar Neanderthal skull was found with a hole punched in it. At the time, palaeontologists speculated that the wound had been made by other Neanderthals, suggesting that it was evidence of ritual cannibalism.That thesis has now been dismissed by the latest discoveries in the cave, with the finger of blame pointed clearly at roving packs of prehistoric cave hyenas, bone-crunching carnivores which were bigger and stronger than their modern counterparts, weighing more than 200lbs .“It could be that hyenas opened up the hole (in the cranium) and then fed on the insides, or it could be that the injury happened by chance,” said Mario Rubini, the local director of anthropology.It was not just Neanderthals that the hyenas were feeding on. Experts said many of the bones belonging to elephants, rhinos, giant deer, cave bears, wild horses and aurochs “show clear signs of gnawing.”Hyenas would have “dragged their prey to their dens, using the cave as a food cache,” experts said.The discovery, made by archaeologists from the region of Lazio and from the University of Tor Vergata in Rome, confirms the cave “as one of the most important sites in the world for the history of Neanderthals,” Italy’s culture ministry said in a statement.Dario Franceschini, the culture minister, hailed it as “an extraordinary discovery which will excite interest in the whole world.”The remains of nine Neanderthals were found, eight of which were dated to 50,000-68,000 years ago, while the oldest was dated to around 100,000 years ago. One was a female while the rest were males.The Guattari Cave unyielded an extraordinary hoard of fossilised bones, not just of Neanderthals but of the hyenas that were eating them, as well as rhinoceroses, elephants, aurochs - giant cattle that were driven to extinction a few hundred years ago - and Megaloceros, a species of giant deer sometimes as the Irish elk.Francesco Di Mario, the head of the dig, said: “They are all adult iniduals, except for one who may have been in his early teens.”He said the fact that the remains of nine Neanderthals had been found, as well as two others in 1939, suggested that the species’ population would have been quite large in the area.Neanderthals, the closest ancient relatives of humans, flourished for about 250,000 years but died out about 40,000 years ago.It is unclear what killed them off, with theories ranging from an inability to adapt to climate change to competition from Homo sapiens.The cave was discovered in February 1939 - it had been sealed by an ancient landslide, preserving evidence of the world as it was 50,000 years ago.The presence of so many fossils “makes the cave an exceptional data bank” for life in prehistoric times, the culture ministry said.This latest dig began in October 2019 and explored a part of the cave known as the “laghetto” or lake which floods in winter.Recent research has indicated that far from being the hulking, heavy-browed brutes of popular imagination, Neanderthals were sophisticated and intelligent.There is new evidence to suggest that they dabbled in cave painting, wore ornaments such as eagle claws and used tools made from bone to make clothing from animal skins.The discovery last month of a piece of 50,000-year-old string in a cave in France also helped confound the idea that Neanderthals were cognitively inferior to Homo sapiens.It is now generally accepted that Neanderthals were able to use and control fire and that they buried their dead in graves.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"full stops words non merci says french education ministry ban","story":"France’s education ministry has banned the use of gender-inclusive words in classrooms, saying they harm learning and risk cementing the status of English as the world’s dominant language.The decree sent to schools across the country took specific aim at the practice of introducing full stops into the middle of words to denote both masculine and feminine endings, such as turning “amis” (friends) into “ami.e.s” - a so-called \u0027midpoint\u0027. In French grammar, nouns reflect the gender of the object to which they are referring and male dominates female in mixed settings - so a group of friends with nine women and one man would nevertheless be termed with the masculine ‘amis’.Activists have long pushed for textbooks to add an ‘e’ to feminise certain words, making them more inclusive. In their preferred teaching materials, “élus”, French for elected officials, becomes “élu.e.s”, for example.But in the decree published last week by the Education Ministry, two members of the Académie francaise, the 400-year-old institution which guards the French language, banned the use of midpoints in schools, saying they are “harmful to the practice and understanding of the French language.” In its defense of the ban, France’s Education Ministry said spelling out words with midpoints was confusing.“It dislocates words, breaks them into two,” said Nathalie Elimas, the State Secretary for Priority Education. “With the spread of inclusive writing, the English language - already quasi-hegemonic across the world - would certainly and perhaps forever defeat the French language.”In an interview with the French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche, France\u0027s Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said the use of midpoints also put people with learning disabilities, such as dyslexia, at a disadvantage.The SUD Education Union, one of the largest teaching unions, called for educators to ignore the Ministry’s decree, and demanded that Blanquer “stop trying to impose his backwardness on the education community.”  Some concessions were made to proponents of inclusive language. The decree calls for the feminisation of job titles for women, such as using “présidente” instead of “président” when referring to a female leader.Most job titles in French are masculine and linguists have found evidence of women being discouraged from applying to roles with exclusively male titles.The decree also encourages the use of femine and masculine options when posting a school job announcement - for example “le candidat or la candidate,” to make it clear the role is open to both men and women.French linguistics has been dominated by a war between the ‘old guard’ who want to preserve traditions and Left-wing groups saying the language needs to be lifted from its ‘sexist’ roots.President Emmanuel Macron’s administration has taken aim at ‘woke’ university culture in an attempt to prevent voters deserting him for hard-Right Marine le Pen in next year’s election.The debate over inclusivity in the French language also sparked headlines in February, when 60 MPs proposed a new law that would ban public servants from using gender inclusive words in their work.“The advent of inclusive writing makes the learning of the French language harder, since it creates a gap between the spoken language and the written language,” the MPs, a mix of centrists from President Emmanuel Macron’s party and the conservative Les Republicains, wrote in the proposal.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures weekend nicola sturgeon sailor strikes pose garden","story":"Scottish First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon during a visit to Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, after the SNP won a fourth victory in the Scottish Parliament electionThe SNP fell one seat short of an overall majority in the Scottish parliament elections, securing 64 seats, but the final result still leaves Holyrood with a pro-independence majorityCovid lockdown roadmap: the rules that could change from May 17Rescuers work into the night to save whale stranded in River ThamesSeven people shot dead after gunman opens fire at Colorado birthday partyAngela Rayner claims victory in Sir Keir Starmer\u0026#39s chaotic reshuffleForget the thwack of leather on willow, bamboo could make the best cricket batFree lateral flow tests may not be OK for departing green list holidaymakersBoris Johnson ready to confirm the return of indoor socialising and dining from May 17 Comment: Sir Keir Starmer isn’t the solution to the Labour Party’s crisis, he’s the causeBoris Johnson ready to recommit to a social care overhaul in the Queen’s SpeechComment: Labour will keep on losing if it does not find answersBoris Johnson expected to top list of Tory MPs under investigation by parliament\u0026#39s sleaze watchdog\u0026#39Dogecoin is a hustle\u0026#39: Elon Musk sends his \u0026#39fav\u0026#39 cryptocurrency tumbling on Saturday Night Live Local election results 2021: how your council voted and how the numbers map across EnglandMay 2021 election results: the maps, charts and data of how your area voted across the UKLondon mayoral election results 2021: Sadiq Khan re-elected for second term Scottish election results 2021: the charts and maps that show how Scotland votedNicola Sturgeon tells Boris Johnson that Indyref2 is a matter of \u0026#39when, not if\u0026#39Search all monuments for slavery links, Church of England tells parishesPursuit of Love star Emily Beecham on feeling \u0026#39unsafe\u0026#39 during sex scenes Is it now time to lift Covid restrictions?

But are things really that simple  More than , council seats in England were up for grabs in this week’s elections. So were the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Parliament,  police commissioners,  mayors, the London Assembly and the Hartlepool by-election.While Keir Starmer ’s failings in the Red Wall have rightly been well-publicised, the results were always going to be complicated.So we’ve compiled a guide to the results below - taking you through not just big news, but the important things you may have missed.  . Nicola Sturgeon has got enough seats to hold a new independence vote It’s tempting to start by talking about Labour ’s latest collapse. But by far the most important result is further north, where Nicola Sturgeon’s SNP won  out of  Scottish Parliament seats.That left her one short of an SNP majority. She failed to get key victories over Labour in Dumbarton or Tories in Aberdeenshire West. But she can claim more of a mandate than in , having won three more seats and raised her vote share by . points. And with the pro-independence Greens winning eight seats, she’s pushing for a second referendum anyway in the next four years. That could break up the UK, ending the Union that has survived more than  years.Already the battle has begun over how it’ll work - with Boris Johnson insisting there should be no separation vote. But Michael Gove has signalled the UK government is unwilling to go to the Supreme Court to stop it. . Labour are being wiped out in the aposred wallaposNow we come to England’s main story of the night - its decimation in northern and Midlands heartlands. Keir Starmer’s party lost Hartlepool, red since its creation in , in a Westminster by-election that was even worse than expected. New Conservative MP Jill Mortimer said Labour had taken the people of Hartlepool for granted as she notched up a , majority. In an even more symbolic result, Labour lost control of Durham council for the first time in a century after losing  seats.Durham was the first council to be run by Labour in . But the Tories gained  seats, building on their victory in North West Durham in the  general election.Dudley, neck-and-neck until this week, now has almost twice as many Tory seats as Labour ones. Labour also lost control of Sheffield and lost nine seats in Sunderland. Tory Ben Houchen was ed with a whopping % majority in the Tees Valley mayor election while Tory Andy Street held the West Midlands mayoralty, adding  points to his vote share despite Labour mounting a challenge.  . But all is not terrible for Labour - or great for the Tories - where in EnglandWhat’s curious about recent English elections is not just the Red Wall, where Labour’s suffering, but the so-called Blue Wall. While much of the southern map is Tory shires, these results suggest a pattern of Labour making in-roads in surprising areas. Labour seized two key mayoralties from the Tories, the West of England and Cambridgeshire  Peterborough, increasing the party’s vote share by  points and  points respectively. New West of England mayor Dan Norris even thanked Keir Starmer in his speech, while Cambridgeshire  Peterborough’s new red mayor Nik Johnson won despite his party coming third behind the Lib Dems last time. Cambridgeshire council also slipped from the Tories’ grasp, with Labour and the Lib Dems both gaining. This success in the south was not universal. Labour’s Sadiq Khan was re-elected London mayor but with a vote share down  points.And the Tories kept most of their southern strongholds - plus seized control of Harlow, Essex, from Labour. But the Tories did lost  seats in Surrey, and lost control of Tunbridge Wells after a Lib Dem push. In West Sussex meanwhile, Labour more than doubled their seat tally.... to nine. All this appears to point to a redrawing of England’s election map after decades of tradition. . Thereaposs actually a slight swing towards Labour since This week’s results were comparing Labour to its local elections performance in  and . One theory is that Labour sank much further between then and , and has risen since, but not by the same amount. Pollster Patrick English of YouGov said analysis of , ‘key wards’ implied a three-point swing to Labour since . If applied unormly across Britain, it would mean a smaller Commons Tory majority with  seats, and  Labour ones. That would support Keir Starmer’s narrative that he’s leading Labour on a slow path to recovery after the  election disaster. Analysis is to be taken with a pinch of salt, though - as this week’s results show there is no unorm set of thinking in the UK. . The Green Party have quietly been the biggest success of the nightYou won’t have seen it on the front pages, but the Green Party is celebrating a surge in the local election results. As more people cycle, walk and appreciate nature in the pandemic, and as left-wingers have jitters about Labour, the party gained  council seats with most declared - more than doubling its total. In the Scottish Parliament, the Greens added three seats to their tally to reach eight. In the London Assembly they have three of  seats, up one, and candidate Sian Berry was a strong third in the capital’s mayor race. She finished with almost % of first-choice votes, up two points and way ahead of the Lib Dem who lost her deposit.  Ms Berry said: “It is a serious mandate for the ideas we were putting in front of the public this campaign - rent controls, flat fares, and a higher living wage.” Sandy Hore-Ruthven lost her bid to unseat Labour’s mayor of Bristol, but she raised the Greens’ vote share by  points and came a strong second. It’s been suggested that the Greens eating into left-wing Labour votes could be partly to blame for Keir Starmer’s woes. This isn’t just a general fringe party thing either. By comparison, the Lib Dems were pretty static - down  council seats with most results declared.. Wales was a success story for Labour - bucking Englandaposs trendAll  seats were up for grabs in the Welsh Parliament. Polls had suggested Labour - while the biggest party - had an uphill struggle to win an overall majority. But the party did not suffer the collapse seen in England at all, winning  of the Senedd seats and allowing Mark Drakeford to stay on as First Minister. Only one of Walesapos so-called red wall seats, the Vale of Clwyd, fell to the Welsh Conservatives, and the party also unseated the former Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood in Rhondda. Wrexham, meanwhile, remained a marginal brick in Labour’s ‘red wall’ with a slightly higher majority. Voters flocked to the two main parties, with Labour and Tories each raising their constituency vote share by % overall since .  . Scottish Labour are fairly pleased with themselves, tooIt helps that Scottish Labour set their expectations low, only hoping for a “strong third” behind the SNP and Tories. But those were surpassed, with Labour notching up a % vote share in constituencies - only just behind the Conservatives - and % in the regional list. Leader Anas Sarwar’s  seats are behind the -seat tally achieved in . Labour’s vote share was also down since  across the board. But insiders insist overall, this is a boost since the  wipeout. Mr Sarwar also knocked a very slight dent in Nicola Sturgeon’s vote share in a publicity-grabbing run against her in her own seat. And Labour clung on in ultra-marginal Dumbarton, where deputy leader Jackie Baillie held out to deny the SNP a majority. There’s a long, long, long way to go, but Scottish Labour have not collapsed completely - and low expectations were met.  . It was a bad night for fringesNigel Farage’s latest outfit Reform UK had won just two council seats in the entire country with most of the , results declared. Anti-‘woke’ controversialist Laurence Fox won .% of the vote in London, more than Count Binface but losing his £, deposit. He was pipped to the post by YouTuber Niko Omiilana, who ran on a policy of cutting Freddos to p and telling the PM to “shush”. Alex Salmond missed out on any Scottish Parliament seats with his new outfit Alba, which he now suggests he won’t lead for long. UKIP had also lost all five of the seats it was defending at the time of writing.  And it was a good night for incumbentsOne thread that unites many of these clashing results is a boost for incumbents - politicians who were already in the job. And perhaps that’s not too surprising, as Brits looked for a stable “devil you know” in a time of crisis. It may be true too that the success of the vaccine rollout prompted some to reward sitting politicians, especially the Tories.

The pandemic squeezed the politics out of the campaign with people in forgiving mood towards the Government following last year’s bad mistakes. Freshly vaccinated voters were showing little anger, just a desire to pull together and get through it all. I say little anger, butI am honest, where I did detect this, it was directed more at Labour than the government. As I revisited areas where I used to receive strong political support, I was told that Labour had lost its way. What do you think  Have your say below Jeremy Corbyn still casts a long shadow. A woman voter in Chaucer Avenue told me: “I cannot believe I am telling you this but I voted Tory because of Corbyn.” When I told her Keir Starmer is very dferent, she snapped back: “You will have to prove it – you can earn my vote before I come back.” There was more like this. The message was clear: Labour needs to get its act together. Locally too, they were disillusioned with Labour councillors who were aloof from them, speaking a language that owed more to far-left platitudes than their everyday lives.  Despite the disappointment of the by-election loss, we are now going to see the re-building of Labour’s reputation locally, and similar fightbacks are taking place in many former Labour strongholds as Starmer supporters gain the upper hand over Corbyn’s army of zealots. ButI take away one abiding impression, it is that in towns like Hartlepool the political kaleidoscope has turned and Labour is not going to recover by attempting to bring back the past. A new model Labour party is being demanded by voters, who themselves have moved on.  In smart and proud former council houses now occupied by their owners, voters want a Labour party that understands their aspiration, believes in social justice, knows this has to be paid for and will ensure that fair rules apply to all – from hard-working welfare recipients to the rich and privileged. They want to be heard, not talked down to, and they want to get behind policies they feel are genuinely useful and relevant to improving their lives. Labour has not spoken to these voters for over a decade since Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were prime ministers.

The Tory victory of  was no one-off. Labour has lost an emotional connection with working class people. It didn’t fall out of the sky. We weren’t blindsided. It’s been festering for years and threatens the existence of the party. The stakes are that high. This is not just a problem within a ‘Red Wall’ of seats in the Midlands and North. It is everywhere – including London where Labour lost amongst working class voters. So how can we rebuild  The clue is in the name – labour. We should start with work and commit to guarantee decent jobs – “jobs you can raise a family on” to quote President Biden – for every citizen in the country.  From this day on everything Labour does and says should focus on creating good work. Industrial policy and solutions to the climate crisis – our plans for new housing, roads, rail, bridges, ideas to rebuild our social care system and our health, education and council services – should all be driven by an overriding duty to create millions of decent, well paid, unionised quality jobs for all our people. On Saturday victorious Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham talked about giving everyone “the dignity of decent work”. He is bang on. Coming out of lockdown and with furlough ending, things are going to get bumpy. Expect more sharp practices like the hundreds of British Gas workers sacked for refusing a worse contract. Tesco and Network Rail tried to ‘fire and rehire’ their workers and it persists across local government. Think of the Deliveroo driver making as little as £ an hour whilst their CEO rakes in hundreds of millions in share options saying his couriers don’t want any sick or holiday pay. Even the Supreme Court said recently that the power imbalances in companies such as Uber must be rectied. These are questions of human dignity – they shine a light on what we as a country will tolerate and what we will not. The Tories won’t confront this stuff despite their bluster.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeBoris Johnson is set to give a pm press conference on Monday confirming England’s lockdown can be eased on May . The Prime Minister is widely expected to announce that England can enter ‘Step Three’ of the roadmap he first set out in February. That means reopening pubs and restaurants indoors, letting family and friends stay overnight and reopening foreign travel. Hugging between friends and family also looks set to be allowed for the first time in  months, while steam rooms at spas can reopen. While nothing has been confirmed yet by Downing Street, we know the broad picture thanks to the roadmap itself and previous government announcements. So here’s our best guess of what you might be able to expect.  Hugging allowed Family and friends from dferent bubbles are expected to be allowed to hug again for the first time since March . With more than half of Brits having at least one vaccine dose, the PM is expected to say people should use their common sense. Broader social distancing rules, including in public venues like pubs and restaurants, will remain until at least June .But Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove confirmed the plan is to restore hugging from May  between friends and family - as first reported in The . “Friendly contact - intimate contact - between friends and family is something we want to see restored,” he told the BBC.  Overnight stays permitted If all goes to plan, Step Three will allow people from dferent bubbles to meet indoors from May  for the first time since the turn of the year. Groups of up to six people or two households - whichever is larger - will be allowed to meet in an indoor setting. This means that for the first time since the January lockdown, you can visit family where in England and stay the night . It’s likely government guidance on sensible social distancing, cleaning and ventilationwill remain.   Pubs can open indoors The rule of six indoors applies equally to hospitality venues such as pubs, restaurants and cafes. This indicates they will be allowed to open indoors from May  for the first time since the New Year. As with private homes, there will still be a maximum gathering size of six people or two households. Pubs will also be table service only, although there is no need to order a “substantial meal” with a drink any more.   Up to  people can gather outdoors The current limit of six people or two households on outdoor gatherings is likely to be removed at Step . Instead, there will only be a legal limit of  people for outdoor gatherings, except for some organised events as outlined below. This will mean large groups are once again allowed to gather in parks like last summer.  Domestic holidays can resume Currently, only self-contained holiday accommodation can open in England - and people can only stay with their own bubble. Now that you can stay overnight with people from dferent bubbles, hotels, BBs and other holiday venues like hostels are expected to reopen. This essentially means England’s domestic tourism industry is allowed to be back in business.   Foreign travel can resume From May , the legal ban on taking a holiday outside the UK is set to be lted and travel will be allowed. However, Brits ing from the vast majority of countries will have to isolate on their , either at home or in a £,-a-head hotel. Only ‘green list’ countries will be exempt from this and there are currently only a tiny handful of countries on the list, including Portugal and Israel. Most of the countries on the UK’s green list still require Brits to isolate when they get to that country, making holiday plans worthless. However, restrictions are widely expected to ease quite quickly as we move into June and July.  No cap on mourners at funerals The cap on mourners at funerals is set to be axed ahead of schedule when England enters Step Three from May . Currently funerals can only have  attendees while wakes are limited to  - a limit that was maintained for Prince Philipaposs memorial service. This limit was set to be reconsidered in step four of the roadmap, but the government has brought it forward. Instead of a -person limit, venues will decide how many people can attend safely while still keeping up social distancing rules. That means two metres between mourners, or one metre plus mitigations like masks, screens and ventilation. The new rules will apply to both indoor and outdoor services - but not wakes .   Larger events can start going ahead Fans canto sports fixtures in Step Three, with outdoor venues permitted capacities of , people or half-full, whichever is lower. In the largest outdoor seated venues, where crowds can spread out, up to , people will be able to attend, or grounds can be a quarter-full, whichever is fewer. Fans can attend larger performances and sporting events indoors, with capacities of , people or half-full, whichever is fewer. Other events have already been taking place - with bigger crowds and no social distancing - but theyaposre part of a special pilot scheme and people must get negative tests to enter.

The Prime Minister is under mounting pressure to give permission for another separation poll after Nicola Sturgeonaposs party fell one seat short of an outright majority at Holyrood.But with the pro-independence Greens winning eight seats, there is a parliamentary majority in Edinburgh in favour of splitting the UK.It comes seven years after Scots voted % to % to remain in the Union.Ms Sturgeon claimed it would be absurd and completely outrageous for the PM to go to court to block another referendum. She told BBCaposs The Andrew Marr Show: For this to end up in court, which is not something I ever want to see, it would mean a Conservative Government had refused to respect the democratic wishes of the Scottish people and the outcome of a democratic election and tried to go to the Supreme Court to overturn Scottish democracy.Ms Sturgeon that it was up to the Scottish people to decide the countryaposs future, adding: In this election they have voted overwhelmingly for the SNP and we stood on a manesto commitment to firstly ... continue to steer the country through the Covid pandemic, but after the crisis to give the people of Scotland the opportunity to choose our own future in a referendum.” Warning No not to scupper another independence vote, the SNPaposs deputy leader Keith Brown signalled an unsanctioned poll would be called anyway.He said: “In the event that there are any denials of Scottish democracy, in the event that Boris Johnson tries to do a Trump and tries to use the legal process to subvert Scottish democracy, I believe the referendum will still happen.” Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove downplayed suggestions the Government could try to thwart a vote through the courts.He said: Weaposre not going near there.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeA dad-of-three who lived a seemingly ordinary le has been exposed as a chief drug dealer in the aposhighest criminal circlesapos of international gangs. Thomas Maher appeared to be another successful businessman with a taste for nice cars and flash jewellery.But an international probe by officers at National Crime Agency uncovered his links to dealers in Colombia and Europe, reports the Liverpool Echo. Just before he was caught, he sent messages to gang members talking about fleeing the country and starting a new le in Cyrus, where there is no extradition treaty with the UK. He bragged in EncroChat messages about being involved in organised crime for over  years, during which time it’s highly likely he shipped tonnes of drugs and tens of millions of pounds around Europe. Maher first came to the attention of the NCA after police discovered the bodies of  dead Vietnamese migrants who had asphyxiated in the back of a lorry registered in his name. Although officers were unable to charge Maher in relation to the deaths, the NCA then became interested in his affairs. Maher, who ran a haulage business, lived in a modest home in the suburbs of Warrington. He had a taste for fast food and loved taking his family out for nice meals and posing for selfies. The NCA has now provided transcripts of messages Maher sent on the EncroChat network, which reveal the degree of his involvement in the drug trade. Maher was jailed for  years as a result of a massive police operation which allowed investigators to read messages on the EncroChat phone network - used by established criminals.Maher, who used the Encro handle Satirical, discussed moving cocaine out of Colombia, where the drug is sourced. In a series of messages, he talked about how the pandemic had stopped some of his drug deals from going through.  In another section of messages, Maher talked about the presence of rival crime factions in Sweden, and business opportunities in China, saying there was aposmassive money over thereapos. He later discussed another gang member who had been jailed as a result of a NCA-led investigation into his tax affairs. Maher worried about the pressure from the NCA in the UK and talks about fleeing the country.  He said: Mate look at a lot of cases here and big players in their eyes normally itaposs only conspiracy they get done on and can get big time.

Maheraposs role in the global drug trade became clear when police in Europe managed to penetrate the Encrochat network that he relied on to communicate with associates. On June  last year Maher, then , was arrested at his Warrington home during a raid by the NCA. He later pleaded guilty to two charges relating to importing Class A drugs into the UK and two charges of money laundering.  Maher, originally from Ireland, was jailed for  years during a hearing last December for drug and money laundering offences. After Maher was sentenced in December last year senior officers at the NCA spoke about the role he played as a logistics man who helped notorious crime groups.

Around a third of people with coronavirus show no symptoms, so can infect others without even knowing they’ve been ill. Rapid testing is a vital tool to make sure people know when to self isolate so they break the chain of transmission. Alex, , from Hemel Hempstead, works for JamVans, a removal company that provides Covid- tests for its employees. He was experiencing no symptoms at all when he tested positive for Covid. “We move people’s homes on a daily basis, and also have a delivery contract with a local hospice – it has about  charity stores, and we help them move all the stock,” says Alex. “One morning before work I did a rapid Covid- test outside the hospice, then sat in my van waiting for the results. I’d done a few of these tests, and thought it would be fine as I didn’t have a single symptom – but then the test came back positive.”  “I spoke to the hospice on the phone from outside the building, and they told me I had to go for a PCR test. My company booked me in with a private firm and I went straight there. Our company policy is that we have to wear a mask in people’s houses and throughout our offices, and I stick to the guidelines as much as I can, so at first I thought the rapid flow test must be wrong. But within an hour, I was told I definitely had Covid. I couldn’t quite believe it.” Alex was able to isolate straightaway, ensuring he wasn’t spreading Covid to any vulnerable people he came into contact with. “I stopped working to self-isolate on full pay, and still didn’t develop any symptoms at all,” he says. “Without the test, I definitely would have carried on working, which is why it’s so important to have regular tests, evenyou haven’t got any symptoms. I had the virus and I felt fine, but imagineI’d given it to my parents, my grandparents or my colleagues  “If I’m driving between  charity shops, with three or four people in each shop, I could have been quite a spreader. I would have put a lot of people at risk, who may not be as young and healthy as I am – you never know who you’re passing it on to. It might sound dramatic, but in my case, taking the test could have saved lives. I haven’t had the jab yet, but I will as soon as I can – and I’ll still be taking two tests a week.Get into the testing habit More than half the adults in the UK have had at least one dose of Covid vaccination and lockdown restrictions are beginning to ease. But the virus is still out there and around a third of all the people who are infected do not show any symptoms. Regular rapid testing is vital to break the chain of transmission – now all adults are advised to do two tests a week. Rapid testing kits are free and you can do them at home, with results appearing within just  minutes. If you test positive, you’ll be able to isolate straightaway rather than risk spreading Covid to others. Millions of people have already made regular home testing part of their routine, as secondary school children and their parents have been able get free tests since February, but now everyone is encouraged to play their part. Every test helps to put your mind at rest and helps protect people around you as the country moves out of lockdown. Around one in three people with coronavirus has no symptoms. Rapid Covid-tests are for people who aren’t showing symptoms. If you’re showing symptoms , order a PCR test. Test twice a week, or every three or four days: it’s the best way to catch a case of Covid- at the point it becomes highly infectious.If you test positive you should self-isolate immediately and visit nhs.uk get-tested or call  to order a PCR test that will confirm the result.If you test negative, you must still follow the Hands, Face, Space and Fresh Air rules to minimise the spread of Covid-. Rapid tests are easy to use and give results within  minutes. It’s important to report your results online straightaway, whether the test is positive, negative or even void. It’s easy to do at gov.uk report-covid-result or by calling .More than m rapid tests have been taken since October , and hundreds of thousands of positive cases among people with no symptoms have been picked up. Information from the rapid tests is kept anonymous, and scientists use it to spot patterns and outbreaks more quickly and accurately, helping to reduce the risk of future lockdowns. Even though you might have already had one or two doses of vaccine, there’s a chance you could still give Covid to someone , as no vaccine is  per cent effective. So it’s vital to test twice weekly as well as continuing to follow social distancing guidance, washing hands, wearing a face covering and letting fresh air in. Rapid Covid- tests are suitableyou have no symptoms of Covid .“Remember, around a third of people with coronavirus have no symptoms, but could be spreading it to others without knowing,” says GP Dr Amir Khan. “Rapid testing is effective at detecting people who are infectious and enabling us to find Covid- cases that we otherwise would not know about. This helps us in our efforts to stop the spread of the virus. Testing regularly even when you have no symptoms means we can keep infection levels low and our country safe, and the good thing is they give a result within  minutes.” And, as Dr Khan notes, the tests are very reliableyou do them correctly. “Testing ourselves for coronavirus using rapid Covid- tests is vital in keeping ourselves and others safe from coronavirus and keeping infection rates in our communities low. When done correctly, the tests are at least . per cent specic, which means the risk of  positives is extremely low – less than one in a thousand. This means it is a very good test.”‘All I had was a mild sore throat’ Kim Tobin, from Southend, Essex, works in a supermarket and had a positive Covid- test in January  Routine rapid testing in the workplace helped Kim, , discover she had Covid, even though she was showing no symptoms. Without the test, she could have spread it to her workmates and customers.“I had a very, very mild sore throat, just a little scratch and that was it,” she says. “I didn’t even think anything of it. I was all dressed for work, ready to go. Then I went and had the test, and after  minutes the lady who had done it came up to me and said, ‘You need to go home right now because you’ve got it – you’ve tested positive.’”"},{"url":null,"title":"family beautiful mum 33 who","story":"NewsFamily of beautul mum, , who died in crash on M say le has stood stillNatalie Doherty, , lost control of her car on the M near Bury, Greater Manchester - she leaves behind her six-year-old son BobbymirrorShareCommentsByPaige Oldfield:,  MAY NewsNatalie Doherty with six-year-old son Bobby \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Natalie Doherty, , lost control of her vehicle on the motorway near Bury on Saturday afternoon. She had just joined the road when her car hit floodwater, aquaplaned, left the carriageway and crashed into a tree. Tragically, she was pronounced dead at the scene, leaving behind her six-year-old son Bobby.Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, family members have said it doesnapost feel real.She hasn’t lived her le, they said, heartbroken. Last night, Natalie’s mother, Marion Mckenzie, lay awake clutching a photo of her only child. The family said they “just knew” something was wrong when they didn’t hear from her for several hours. Then, at .pm, they received a phone call that would change their lives forever. Speaking to the MEN, Marion described the moment she found out her daughter had died. The -year-old became emotional as she said: “I screamed and Bobby said, ‘What’s wrong with nana ’ “We told him I had stubbed my toe. “Then Bobby sat on his bed with his McDonald’s watching telly.  “This morning, I realised we will never see her again. “We will never speak to her. “You just think to yourself, why did she have to go  Why didn’t she just stay at home  Why didn’t they go in the van  “But you could question everything.” Her inconsolable family have since come together to pay tribute to the “stunning” mum-of-one, who they say had a “heart of gold”. “Le has been horrendous. It’s like le has stood still,” Marion’s partner, Andrea Mckenzie, said. “Time has stopped and it’s not real. “I can’t imagine what Marion is going through. It’s her only child. “She hasn’t lived her le. She hasn’t lived her le with Bobby – and you should never have to bury your own children. “Marion just lay there with tears streaming down her face. She didn’t even shut her eyes. “She just had a picture of Natalie and herself in her hands, clutching it, and there’s nothing I can do.”  Natalie had grown up in Haslingden in Rossendale but lived in Crawshawbooth near Rawtenstall at the time of her death. She had attended secondary school in Rochdale before going on to work as a dental nurse for  years, her latest job being a receptionist at a dental practice. Her family say she loved food, shopping and visiting beauty salons, but most of all being a mother to her young son. Bobby was meant to be travelling in the car with Natalie at the time of the crash but wanted to stay at his grandmother’s house instead. Andrea continued: “He’s six – his dad told him mummy is an angel and that god only takes the good angels. “I’ve never seen a bond like the bond with her and Bobby they were absolutely inseparable. “She said she would pick Bobby up but he wanted to stay with his nana, thank God. “We didn’t hear anything because she usually rings to FaceTime with Bobby. “We didn’t hear anything and we just knew. “It got to pm and we knew something wasn’t quite right. At .pm we got the phone call.” Natalie’s cousin, Debra Wainwright, described her passing as a “massive loss”. She said: “I was brought up with Natalie and she’s more like a sister to me than a cousin. “She was really close to my mum and loved going to aunty Ann’s for a Sunday lunch. “We are a very close-knit family and it’s a massive, massive loss.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

But now first-time parents Cary and Mark, both , are overjoyed to have their baby boy at home and thriving after a rollercoaster year. Carly, from Seaham, told Chronicle Live: When we heard those words that he could finally come home I burst into tears. I had to stay in the hospital overnight the night before and I just couldnapost sleep. I was nervous because heaposd never been in the same room as me alone, where I would fully take care of him - change his nappies, give him his feeds. But all I could think was aposyouaposre coming home tomorrow, youaposre finally coming home with us.apos And when we eventually got home, me and Mark both cried because we couldnapost believe that the time had come for him to be at home with us.Oscar was born on June , at  weeks and one day gestation, after a blood test at  weeks found that Carly had a high blood pressure and severe pre-eclampsia.Carly had become concerned that she couldnapost feel her baby move and she remained at Sunderland Royal Hospital for two weeks, where she received daily scans to monitor her baby.  When one scan showed that blood flow had become severely restricted in the umbilical cord, Carly was blue-lighted to James Cook University Hospital, in Middlesbrough, as there were no neonatal beds available in Sunderland. Oscar was born by C-section and swtly transferred to the hospitalaposs NICU, where he spent two-and-a-half months, before ing to Sunderland for further treatment. Carly, who works as an electrician, said: Itaposs quite a shock when you walk into the NICU and hear all of the beeps and sounds of the ventilators and see your little baby in an incubator. The worst part is knowing how poorly your little baby is and not being able to do anything about it and not being able to be by hisside.Due to coronavirus restrictions, Carly and Mark could only visit Oscar for two hours a day, wearing full PPE.Every evening, when Mark finished work as an engineer, the couple would make the -mile round trip to see their son. Carly added: You just wanted to be a mam to your baby, but because of Covid restrictions you couldnapost - it was only for those two hours a day. His grandparents were also unable to visit their grandson, to prevent risk of infection in the hospital, until Oscaraposs health deteriorated when he was four weeks old.Carly received a call from the hospital to askshe would like to come into the hospital early and was later askedshe would likeOscaraposs grandparents to meet him for the first time.The couple knew there was a high chance that they could lose their son, but it was a question they were too scared to ask staff. Carly said: We both had an idea what was going on, but we were too scared to ask the question, aposhow bad is it apos Mark added: I knew I needed to ask, aposhow bad is it apos I asked [and the consultant] replied, aposItaposs very bad, we have got you a flat just next to the unit and you can invite the grandparents to see him.  aposThe next few hours will be make or break but we will do our best.apos Fortunately for the family, one consultant askedhe could try one last attempt at saving Oscaraposs le with hand ventilation. The couple went to bed that night hoping they didnapost get a knock on the door from a nurse, but thanks to the consultantaposs attempts to save Oscar, he is now a happy, thriving -month-old. Oscar was allowed tohome from hospital in October, aged four months. He now weighs lb oz and has recently started to fit into six to nine month clothing. Carly added: It has been such a hard, rollercoaster of a journey. One minute youaposre on a high when you see him doing well, but then the next minute it just changes and you hit rock bottom because something has gone wrong. I think a lot of people donapost realise that thereaposs this little community called the NICU. People think that pregnancy is pregnancy and at the end of it you have a lovely, healthy little baby, but for us that wasnapost the case.  She added: Oscar is a little fighter, heaposs so strong. Heaposs so lovely and heaposs doing all the things that he should be doing for his age now. Heaposs so cheeky and heaposs got such a lovely personality. He was known as aposthe feisty oneapos at James Cook because all the nurses used to keep diaries on the babies in the NICU. They would write what the baby has been up to and every time we read it the nurses would have written aposOscaraposs been feisty again today and trying to pull his tubes out.apos Carly and Mark say they are lucky that there was technology to help them to stay updated on Oscaraposs development, especially while they couldnapost be at the hospital. And they are incredibly thankful to nursing staff and the Neoangels charity, who support families with premature babies, for their efforts to keep them in contact with their baby.

I wholly support this initiative. With my own Asian background, I have experienced first-hand the devastating affect mental health has on people when it is a taboo subject – misunderstood, ignored and brushed under the carpet. We cannot allow this situation to carry on because not recognising the importance of mental health has a wider impact on all society. My parents and countless other first-generation British Pakistanis grew up in a culture that doesn’t acknowledge mental health. I remember my own trauma when I realised I might be made to marry someone my parents chose for me. What do you think  Have your say in comments below  It consumed my thoughts as an -year-old. I couldn’t talk to my parents about it because they would have been ashamed of me, and I couldn’t talk to my teachers and friends because they didn’t understand my culture. So I had no outlet for those feelings of fear, anxiety, anger and helplessness. Shockingly, in Pakistan, families often turn to spiritual healers, who associate mental illness with supernatural forces such as witchcraft, possession and black magic.  A child showing signs of misbehaviour or a woman not adhering to the cultural norms would be taken to one of these healers to rid them of the “gin” or evil spirit. The UK has accessible mental health services with more than , registered therapy professionals. Yet many in the UK’s Pakistani communities don’t reach out for help for fear of judgement. In one UK study, middle-aged Pakistani men and older Indian and Pakistani women reported signicantly higher rates of depression than white people. It angers me that the western-educated Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has not used his  to address the mental health of his population, which could in turn have a positive impact on the Asian community here in the UK.

To get the ball rolling, Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, said: “I want to thank the person who has been caring for my mother over the past year. She has been so generous with her time and spirit and care.” Meanwhile, actor Michael Sheen wanted to thank a special family member. He said: “I want to say thank you to our little daughter Lyra who has spent most of her le in lockdown. Thank you Lyra for keeping us busy and sleep deprived.” Other stars backing the cause are Bear Grylls, Ellie Simmonds and Ainsley Harriot. Visit the website for the Thank You Day campaign here The day is being backed by the Mirror and we are asking readers to send in their nominations for their local heroes and why they want to say thank you to them. The idea for Thank You Day was proposed by a small group of people from across the UK including May Parsons, the nurse who delivered the UK’s first COVID vaccination jab in Coventry in December. May said: “Thank You Day gives me the opportunity to thank all my amazing colleagues working in the NHS and social care.  “This has been the toughest year of our professional careers, and you have all worked so hard to treat all the sick patients who came through our doors, while delivery the biggest and most successful vaccination programme in NHS history.” She added: “I am so grateful to all the people who kept us going: the school teams who looked after our children, shop staff, transport and delivery workers, and everyone  who has helped keep us and the country going. We couldn’t have done it without you.” In an open invitation to the public, the proposers – many of whom are part of the campaigning Together coalition - have said: “Covid- has had a devastating impact on so many people, and it’s tested us in ways we never expected. But for many of us, it has also bought us closer together. Closer to our families and to our communities. “As a country we aren’t always great at saying thank you to each other. But this year we want to be part of changing that.  “To choose one day where we all pause to say thank you to each other. To remember what binds us together, not just what pushes us apart. “We all have dferent people to thank, from family members to key workers, good neighbours to volunteers.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeThe overjoyed owners of a pet dog have voiced their disbelief after he survived a ft clf fall. Miracle pooch Frank plunged down the rugged clf face in Yorkshire as frantic Stewart Wragg searched for him. Frank, a five-year-old Lakeland Patterdale terrier cross, was found by a fisherman at Cayton Bay, Scarborough. He is recovering at home after the shocking deal, which left him with broken front and back left legs and missing teeth. Stunned Stewart said: If he were a human, he would have been dead. He has fallen and landed flat on his left-hand side. Somebody was looking down on him that day because how he has survived that fall, I donapost know. Not only did Frank endure the drop after falling onto the rocks below the clfs at Cayton Bay, Scarborough, North Yorks., but it is a stroke of luck that he was even found ` by a lone fisherman looking for good fishing spots while the tide was coming in. If he had not been found then, he would have been taken out to sea. Frank is now recovering at home in the village of Marsh Lane, Derbys., after having £, worth of vet care which has seen him have one broken leg repaired and his back knee rebuilt with polycarbonate. The accident happened last month when -year-old builder, Stewart, was on holiday with his ex-partner, Allison Howe, , and their son, Ewan, seven. Keen walker Stewart met up with friends to walk the Cleveland Way ` a North Yorkshire -mile walk from Helmsley to Filey.  Frank, his trusty sidekick, who has accompanied him on all his walks, from the Hebridean Way to the Munro mountains of Scotland, was loyally by his side. The father-of-three was embarking on the leg that goes between Scarborough and Filey ` across steep ft clftops - marked with stark warnings - when he noticed at midday that Frank had disappeared. In an unusual twist Frank went missing on a part of the expedition called Frank Clf. The height there is bigger than a football pitch ` which is ft long. Concerned Stewart said: We were at the highest point on the walk, but it didnapost even enter my head that he could have gone over the edge. I suspected he had caught the scent of a rabbit and gave chase. We spent about an hour and a half looking for him when we decided we ought to move on. I was frantic with worry, but terriers are clever dogs and will usually find their way back by retracing their steps.  Stewart called the local dog warden to report Frank missing in the hopes that somebody would find him and hand him in,he didnapost find his way back to the car. But when he got back to his car .pm he wasnapost there, but his phone started ringing. His heart plummeted when Alma Veterinary Surgery in Scarborough said they had Frank in their care, and he wasnapost in a good way after falling from the clf. Stewart said: I askedI could come and get him and they told me it wasnapost as easy as that, that they still didnapost know the extent of the damage and, as he was sedated, I ought to wait until morning. I had the worst nightaposs sleep that night. I really thought I was going to lose him. I have had Frank since he was two-years-old, for three years, and he a great friend to me, to be without him would be awful. He means so much.  Stewart couldnapost believe how Frank had fallen down the clf, been found by a fisherman who had taken him from the beach, wrapped him in a towel and handed him in to the RSPCA. The dog warden contacted by Stewart had also got in touch with the RSPCA who put two and two together. Frankaposs microchip had been damaged in the fall. When I got to see Frank, it was amazing, said Stewart. He couldnapost walk and was severely injured, but he was still wagging his tail like mad. I am just so so grateful that he is alive. It could have had a very dferent ending.

She was stabbed by -year-old Sharon Mather, who had confronted her inside her own home and accused her of taking advantage of a friend who gave the victim money. Now Ms Dolan, who has posed for a string of publications including Front magazine, Twisted Edge and the Daily Sport, claims she is disfigured and can no longer pose for close up facial pictures due to a scar on her lip. The mum of two, from Wigan, Greater Manchester, said: Since the incident, it has affected my confidence and the way I am. It has made me more conscious of being alone. I now no longer use my front door to enter or leave my house. My injuries have healed but the injury to my face has left me feeling like I have nerve damage to my top lip, it feels like I always have a fat lip. There is still a slight scar that can be seen close up but can be covered with makeup. However, I am aware of the fact that I have this scar and I am now really conscious of it. I am also conscious of how this has affected my modelling career and I know now that I can no longer accept work that requires me to have close up face shots. I have two small scars on my leg that I am conscious of. I also feel the scar on my face may have lost me work.  Mather, a former carer, was jailed for five and a half years at Bolton Crown Court after she was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. The jury heard Mather was drunk and angry when she repeatedly attacked Ms Dolan in Wigan, while one of the victimaposs young kids slept upstairs. Sentencing the thug, judge Miss Recorder Alexandra Simmonds told her: You were intent on remonstrating with Miss Dolan because you thought she had taken advantage of a friend of yours. It seemed you were drunk and angry and you started arguing with some money which she had taken from your friend. Miss Dolan did not know what you were talking about at first and wanted you to leave. The two of you had been friends before this night, but something had clearly upset you. The state you were in meant you were not prepared to listen to her. You had a screwdriver in your hand, you struck out at her several times causing three wounds. It was the final injury to her face that perhaps brought you to your senses as you then fled the property, realising what a terrible thing you had done. Miss Dolan sought help from a neighbour and the police were called yet you roamed the streets and ended up at the house of an elderly gentleman who you had cared for in the past. He was extremely concerned about the state that you were in and he thought you had taken drugs or been very drunk. You told him that you had stabbed Miss Dolan and at first, he didnapost believe you. He advised you to go to the police, but you didnapost. Instead, you left his house and hid at a friendaposs house. You turned yourself in a few days later, your friend was concerned you might commit suicide. Miss Dolan is more conscious about being alone in the house, while her injuries have healed, she has some altered sensation in her top lip and there is a slight scar from her face, which she is conscious of because of her modelling career. It is clear you regret your decision to go round to Miss Dolanaposs house that night and I am prepared to accept that your behaviour that night was wholly out of character - almost certainly having been affected by the alcohol you had drank that night. You are going to find the prison environment very dficult to cope with given your mental health dficulties.  The jury heard Ms Dolan and Mather fell out in July  when Mather believed Miss Dolan had taken money from a mutual friend. In the early hours of July  that year, Mather went round to Ms Dolanaposs home and the attack followed. As the victim ran to a neighbouraposs home for help, Mather fled the scene and went to the home of an elderly man she previously cared for and confessed she had stabbed the victim. He advised her to go to police but Mather instead hit at another friendaposs house before surrendering to police a few days later. She later denied wrongdoing. Katie Jones, prosecuting, said: This was a sustained assault on one victim who sustained three injuries. There were children present, but they were asleep upstairs. The offence was committed whilst the defendant was drunk or possibly high. At the time Miss Dolan had been starting out in her modelling career.

Steve Ley, from Devon, says he was in a pub having a drink with a friend one afternoon when the landlady asked him to aposcontrolapos his behaviour because there were children around. He claims he was told to try and be quiet and on his best behaviour and thathe was bad he would have to get out. Steve says he explained he cannot control it because itaposs a medical condition, and now he wants to educate others too.He told Plymouth Live he encounters discrimination on a regular basis.His latest experience has prompted him to post a video on social media calling for people to be better educated about Touretteaposs syndrome, a condition that causes a person to make involuntary sounds and movements called tics. Carpenter Steve, who has chosen not to identy the pub in question, recalled: It was a beautul day and I was really happy to be out. I have drunk in there before but the landlady came over and was really rude and patronising to me. I was asked to control my Touretteaposs and to apostry and be quiet and on my best behaviourapos, and apos I was badapos I would have to get out. I explained I canapost control it and that it just comes out. I also pointed out what she was saying was discrimination because I have a medical condition which I canapost help. She then would not serve me so my friend got me another drink. I was able to stay. He added: I donapost want to name the pub I just want to educate people. Killing it with kindness gets you a bit further in le. Children understand it better than adults sometimes.It didnapost get me down, down, but I thought I would do a video about it and post it on my Facebook page. It has already had , views. Itaposs just a bit demoralising and it shouldnapost happen. I seem to have more problems locally than I do anywhere . I know everyone is struggling at the moment and things are dficult, butyou donapost know what Touretteaposs is in this day and age then itaposs strange. I know what people hear can be quite offensive, but it does not mean I should have to leave somewhere. I donapost have a switch or a volume button. Itaposs discrimination. Steve is well-known locally for his music and also for having appeared on television such as BBC documentary MisFits Like Us. He started having symptoms of Touretteaposs syndrome when he was just six-years-old. It began with an eye twitch and then it slowly developed into vocal ticks as well. He recalled: “It got a lot worse when I was at school. The teachers and pupils didn’t really understand what it was so that made it really hard to deal with. “When I was  doctors finally diagnosed me with Touretteaposs syndrome, but by then I was getting bullied. Being at school was a really tough time for me.” As Steve got older, having Touretteaposs never got any easier, however, it was something he had to learn to deal with. He said: “Having Touretteaposs can make you feel really isolated and alone. It can make you feel anxious and depressed sometimes, and it’s something that you just can’t escape from. I constantly feel like I have to apologise for it.” One thing that helps to channel his tics is performing on stage. Steve said: “I am a singer and I often perform at local pubs and festivals. I find that performing and being on stage really helps my Touretteaposs “I like to keep busy my tics are at their worst when I am sat around doing nothing. I also have a great group of friends that help me and that I feel comfortable around.” This summer Steve is releasing an EP called Colours and the title track has already been released as a single.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeSimon Cowell and David Walliams are backing our ­campaign to save Nathaniel Nabena – as his family race to raise £, in three days. The big-hearted Britain’s Got Talent stars have each given five-figure sums to help the nine-year-old, after we ­revealed his parents must raise £, by Wednesday for a le-saving stem cell transplant. Manchester United and Marvel fan Nathaniel is not entitled to free NHS treatment because he is not a British national.He was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia in the UK after flying here for a £, prosthetic eye fitted privately after losing it to a tumour in his home country Nigeria. Simon, , whose son Eric is seven, said: “This must be a really dficult time for Nathaniel and his parents, let’s all pray that this campaign gets Nathaniel the treatment he needs.” Comedian David, , dad to Alfred, aged eight, said: “Nathaniel is a very special little boy and we must do everything we can to ensure he gets all the treatment he needs so he can enjoy a long and happy le.”You can add to the donations to help save Nathaniel via this GoFundMe pageGenerous Sunday People readers helped raise £, earlier this year for three rounds of chemo at Great Ormond Street Hospital in March to get him in shape for the le-saving op. He responded better than consultants expected and is in remission and in a position for a transplant, using donor stem cells from an umbilical cord. Readers have helped raise another £, last week to fund transplant procedure and doctors at GOSH have kindly waived their private fees to ­reduce the cost. But there is still another £, to find. Consultants at GOSH say his cancer couldat any time and the window for a successful op while chemotherapy is keeping the cancer at bay means the cash must be raised by Wednesday.  After that, the chances of it working will be reduced, and Nathaniel’s only likely option will be palliative care. A host of stars have rallied around to support Nathaniel as the family race to raise cash. Former JLS singer Aston Merrygold, Paul O’Grady and Loose Women’s Coleen Nolan were among those backing the lad.Dad-of-two Aston, , shared the appeal with his k Instagram followers, urging them: “Please help Nathaniel’s family”.Reality star Katie Price shared a fundraising page with her . million Instagram followers and called for fans to “give Nathaniel the chance for a le”.Nathaniel said he is “so grateful” for the support from readers and celebs. He said: “Thank you all, everybody, for helping me and giving me a chance at le. God bless everybody.” His parents Ebi, , and Modupe, , have been moved to tears by the support from stars and People readers.  Ebi said: “I’ve been crying knowing that the British people have given my son another hope in le again when all hope was gone. It is like a modern day miracle. We are so grateful. “We all watch American Idol as a family and Nathaniel watches videos of Simon on TikTok. He is a big fan. To David we say, thank you so much for coming to the aid of a stranger and being a Good Samaritan. We have still got to raise three-quarters of what we need. I have not been able to sleep, I worry so much about how we are going to raise the money. It is so tough.” This week, Nathaniel had tests and saw a psychologist at GOSH ahead of the potential transplant and rested at his relatives’ home in Croydon, South London. Ebi said: “So far the test results have been wonderful. He’s in top shape, he’s doing so well. He’s been playing his video games. “He knows he’s going to be in hospital for a long time and expressed his fears in a meeting with a psychologist. We are doing our best to reassure him.” Nathaniel has already overcome a lot after having his left eye removed last September while fighting another cancer, myeloid sarcoma, in southern Nigeria. His family raised £, so he could travel with Ebi to London to have a prosthetic fitted at London’s Moorfield Eye Hospital in November. Within days of arriving Nathaniel suffered nosebleeds and a fever and was rushed to Croydon University Hospital where he was diagnosed with terminal AML, which affects around  children every year in the UK. It is so aggressive he could have died within weeks without chemo. His family were initially told the total cost of the treatment at GOSH would be up to £,.  Celebrities have voiced their concern for Nathaniel after learning of his desperate situation. Corrie legend Beverley Callard: “This little boy deserves all the help we can give him, so let’s dig deep and get him the treatment he needs to save his le”.Emmerdale’s Claire King: “Please, please help Nathaniel’s family raise £,. Stay strong, Nathaniel. We are all wishing you the very best.”Coleen Nolan, Loose Women list: “What Nathaniel is going through is every family’s worst nightmare. They are so close to the treatment he desperately needs, and the kindness of strangers can help him.”Benidorm’s Sherrie Hewson: “Every child deserves the best chance at le, and while there is hope for Nathaniel, we mustn’t give up. He has shown such bravery coming this far and now he needs a chance at the treatment that could save him. I hope everyone will get behind this courageous little boy and his family to donate and give him a future.”Samantha Giles, Hollyoaks actress: “If you can manage to donate just a pound, it could potentially save Nathaniel’s le. Thank you, thank you! You’ve done something wonderful.”Entrepreneur and presenter Saira Khan: “If we can all give a little bit, we can help to save this little boy’s le.” TV and stage star Claire Sweeney: “GOSH consultants have graciously waived their fee, but we still need to raise £, for a le-saving stem cell treatment. Please dig deep – we only have three days to save this beautul boy.” The transplant treatment is not available in his home country and he was too sick to travel. Ebi and Modupe were in despair when they first spoke to us three months ago. But Sunday People readers stepped in to raise £, for chemo which has given him a chance of surviving a transplant. Clinicians have lowered costs after Nathaniel responded better than expected to treatment and needed less chemo.  And last week we revealed consultants at GOSH have waived their private fees to help Nathaniel. The £, covers the donor stem cell transplant and the cost of care, excluding consultants fees, based on a typical inpatient admission of eight weeks and a three-month post-transplant follow-up as an outpatient. Professor Ajay Vora, a consultant paediatric haematologist at GOSH, said: “All the consultants involved in his care are working in a private ­capacity and have waived their fee because they want to help him. “Our time is not borrowed from the NHS because we are treating Nathaniel in our private service in our time.”  If enough is raised for the transplant, Nathaniel will undergo tests to begin the process on Friday, May . Doctors had hoped to have a bone marrow transplant from one of his two sisters Nadia, , and Nicole,  months. But they were not a match. Ebi said: “Even to get to this point where we may have access to treatment is a miracle. We’d given up hope.”Add to the donations to help save Nathaniel via the GoFundMe pageOperation saved Ava’s le "},{"url":null,"title":"nervous meghan followed queens style","story":"NewsNervous Meghan followed Queens style in first appearance since Oprah, says expertMeghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, is said to have channelled Queen Elizabeth II in her first TV appearance since her and Prince Harrys explosive Oprah Winfrey interviewmirrorShareCommentsByBradley JollyDigital journalist:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video meghan-markle-discusses-daughters-future-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:jFVvOJXM,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Duchess of Sussex, , did not gesticulate a great deal during the broadcast, a pre-recorded piece for coverage of the Vax Live concert.And Judi James, a body language expert, said this reflected the style of the Queen. She added: With the bench she was sitting on looking suspiciously like a plug for her new book, Meghan’s body language at the start looked as serene and static as the large cushion beside her, but with a small self-comfort thumb-rub gesture to suggest some inner nerves, too. Hers was a floral-clad, maternal-looking charisma, low on passionate gesticulation and high on kind smiles and bump-cupping. The regal note appeared verbally too as she sat, upright and elegant, to refer to ‘My husband and I’ in the style of the Queen, but that cupping gesture that she had also used on Oprah, reminded us of her theme about daughters and woman of the future. Meghan, who is expecting her second child, spoke about issues concerning the Covid pandemic and the empowerment of women. But Judi said Meghanaposs speech was not typical of the style weaposve seen her speak in previously. Speaking to The Sun, the body language expert noted Meghan smiled towards the end of her segment, suggesting she was starting to enjoy herself but before then, she was static.While Meghan started carefully, she became more relaxed as the chat went on, Judi added. Judi also compared Meghanaposs style to Prince Harryaposs.  During the speech Meghan, who looked smart in a red floral shirt dress, also spoke about her pregnancy as she cradled her bump. She said: My husband and I are thrilled to soon be welcoming a daughter. “Itaposs a feeling of joy we share with millions of other families around the world.

Lian Clayton, , repeatedly punched Karren Bradshaw, a disabled mum in her s, on her own doorstep. A court heard Clayton pinned the woman to the floor as she punched her, before beginning to kick her and stamp on her ribcage. Liverpool Echo reports Clayton was jailed for  months and three weeks for assault and burglary after a judge heard distressing details about her criminal record.When she was just , the thug stabbed her sister and was convicted of wounding in . The case was heard before a youth court, and she received a youth referral order for the attack, although no further detail was given in open court on Friday. Speaking about the attack on her neighbour, the prosecution said a witness heard the sounds of bones crunching as the woman was screaming in pain. Zahra Baqri, prosecuting, said there was some background between the neighbours, who had lived a few doors away from each other in St Helens, Merseyside. Clayton had previously confronted Mrs Bradshaw and after receiving a message from the womanaposs daughter, telling her to leave her mum alone, Clayton appeared at Mrs Bradshawaposs door and said whereaposs that fat b****** about her daughter. When Mrs Bradshaw explained she didnapost live with her daughter, Clayton punched her to the face a number of times then dragged her out of her own home whilst still punching her. The lawyer told Liverpool Crown Court: The victim lost consciousness and when she came to she was on the ground. At that point the victim was screaming for help.  Julia Boyd, another neighbour, heard the womanaposs screams and ran to the scene, where she was confronted by Clayton sat straggling over the woman having pinned her arms down with her knee while punching and screaming at her victim. Mary Clayton, the defendantaposs mother, was shouting at her daughter to get off the victim. Ms Baqri said: The neighbour tried to help but was unable to do so. All she could manage was to hold the victimaposs hand to try and comfort her. Lian Clayton proceeded to stamp on Mrs Bradshawaposs ribcage with her foot. The neighbour managed to get Mrs Bradshaw to stand and she was then taken to hospital having suffered a broken nose, extensive bruising to her face and damage to her eye which has resulted in her eyesight being ruined and her seeing spider legs across her field of vision. In an interview, Lian Clayton claimed she was acting in self defence but later admitted assault causing actual bodily harm. Mrs Bradshaw said she had been left frightened and was attacked for no reason whatsoever. Three months later, mum and daughter Mary and Lian Clayton burgled Mrs Boyd and her husband, relying on his kind-hearted nature to carry out their crime. While Mrs Boyd was in hospital receiving treatment for a fall Lian and Mary went to Mr Boydaposs home and asked for help claiming they had locked themselves out.

The nurse, who administered a Covid- vaccine to -year-old Margaret Keenan on December , , said Covid- has had a devastating impact on many people, but has also brought us close to each other. Ms Parsons says it is important to thank all the people - including teachers, family members, key workers and neighbours - for what they have done during the pandemic. Visit the website for the Thank You Day campaign here She said: “Thank You Day gives me the opportunity to thank all my amazing colleagues working in the NHS and social care. This has been the toughest year of our professional careers, and you have all worked so hard to treat all the sick patients who came through our doors, while delivering the biggest and most successful vaccination programme in NHS history.I also want to thank the incredible volunteers who gave up their time to support us, and those in their communities who needed help. I am so grateful to all the people who kept us going: the school teams who looked after our children, shop staff, transport and delivery workers, and everyone  who has helped keep us and the country going.We couldn’t have done it without you. I am incredibly proud of our staff and our volunteers, and I want to encourage everyone to embrace Thank You Day and to take part in any way that you can.”  The campaign to establish a Thank You Day on July  has received widespread support. It calls on people to mark the day by getting together with their neighbours, friends and family and joining in a huge nationwide thank-you. There are also plans to arrange special park runs and raising a glass or cup of tea to say Cheers for Volunteers at pm.

We are very proud to be supporting ‘Thank You Day’ on July  which will give us all an opportunity to show our gratitude to those who have gone above and beyond to help the country through the pandemic.It is fantastic that volunteers will be recognised during the day, as across the country, both nationally and locally, they have been pivotal in supporting our communities and the NHS. I look forward to seeing everyone on July  for a well-deserved day of thanks.” In a video released for the launch of the campaign, well-known figures have been saying who they want to thank. Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, said: “I want to thank the person who has been caring for my mother over the past year. She has been so generous with her time and spirit and care.” Actor Michael Sheen said: “I don’t want this to sound like some terrible Oscar speech but I want to say thank you to our little daughter Lyra who has spent most of her le in lockdown.

And bananas aren’t the only fruit to receive special treatment. While McGrady was working for the royal family, serving Princess Diana, Prince William and Prince Harry, they had an unusual way of enjoying pears.“The purveyor would bring about  for us to choose the ripest by hand,” McGrady shared.

The pictures Lily found for her new Gothic-inspired room were amazing, but when I started to search for items to buy I quickly realised I was going to have to get creative to make her dream come true. Lily chose an all-black and grey room but I was able to talk her into a little purple which she loved in the end. Finding what my daughter wanted on eBay for just under £, made an upcycle a necessity rather than a choice. I started scouring Facebook Marketplace for old furniture I could pull mouldings from and took inspiration from upcycle websites and the Frenchic Fan Forum.Elizabethaposs first big bargain was the bed frame, bought on Facebook Marketplace for £, reports the Liverpool Echo.She spent a week cleaning the bed completely, before sanding it down, priming it and applying three coats of Frenchic paint in the shade Blackjack. She added: Finally, I gave the bed a spray over with silver glitter sheen spray and several coats of clear nish. Once the wood work was finished I had to reupholster the bed head in pure velvet using a staple gun. I watched lots of video tutorials on Youtube to get ideas and finished the whole thing with a beaded trim to hide the fact Iaposm not a master craftsperson! I also added some more roses to soften the overall look.  The bed had been a cherished piece of furniture previously and I was nervous about such an extreme change especially as the seller had asked to see the finished piece. Luckily she thought it looked fantastic and was thrilled it had gone to someone who would love it. Soon Elizabeth was able to move onto her next project - the wardrobe.

Science teacher Amy Anderson was told she would not be able to have kids - but has defied the odds to become a mum three times over. Amy, , from Ashby was told in  she might be left infertile after medics spotted the tumour which was making her lactate.She told Leicestershire Live : “It was very strange. My hormones were all over the place. “I’d also been getting headaches and migraines but when I started lactating, I knew something really wasn’t right.To donate to Brain Tumour Research via Amy’s fundraising page click here “When the doctors discovered I had a pituitary adenoma, they said it was so large, I would need surgery quickly, as it was pressing on the nerves behind my eyes. “Devastatingly, I was also told that it meant it was very unlikely that I would ever have children, as the pituitary influences many processes including reproduction. “I was really upset by this news my husband James and I had got married the previous year and we were trying for a baby.” But Amy’s heartbreak ended, when, in February  she discovered she was expecting her first baby. “I was due to be having surgery to remove the tumour but my pregnancy meant that the operation had to be put on hold,” she said.  “I was thrilled to have fallen pregnant but I had to be closely monitored throughout, with frequent scans and blood tests. Being pregnant can produce hormones, that can worsen the symptoms and even cause the tumour to grow. It was an anxious time.” Amy gave birth to a healthy baby girl, Amelia, in November .“My consultant was keen to get on with the surgery as soon after I gave birth as possible but I was breastfeeding and didn’t want to have to stop for the operation,” she said.“When Amelia was nearly six months old, I began to wean her off breastmilk in preparation for my op.” Unfortunately, before her scheduled surgery, in May , Amy suddenly lost her eyesight and suffered an excruciating headache. She had to call an ambulance to take her to Queen’s Hospital Burton.She said: “When I got to hospital, they discovered the tumour had ruptured and, on  May, I was transferred to Royal Stoke University Hospital for emergency surgery. They removed as much of the tumour as possible, through my nasal cavity. “It was an horrendous situation. I felt so vulnerable, not being able to see properly. On top of that, it was the first time I’d been separated from Amelia. “I missed her so much. Thankfully, the surgery was a success but it took a while for me to regain my sight and to recover from the surgery.” Amy was told that following her surgery, her pituitary s could be lost and she was likely to have diabetes insipidus for the rest of her le. She was also warned that the treatment would probably cause infertility. “The diabetes is manageable – it just involves taking three tablets a day.,” she said. “My vision mostly ed to normal, although my peripheral vision still isn’t what it used to be. “It was a huge blow being told that we wouldn’t have any more children. James and I always wanted to have a big family.” Just three months after her surgery, Amy was delighted to discover that she was pregnant again. She said: “Having been told that I was unlikely to fall pregnant again, we were thrilled to be expecting our second child. Once again, I was closely monitored throughout but I had a healthy pregnancy and Freddie was born on  April , without any complications”. The next year was hectic, as Amy was mother to a baby and a toddler but health-wise, things remained stable. However, when her headaches ed in May , she was scanned and the images revealed the tumour had re-grown.

Patty Hernandez, , from Charlotte, North Carolina, continued the unusual family tradition by naming her newborn Clayton. She named all of her children with the same first letter in honour of their -year-old dad Carlos. But Patty revealed that she and her husband had struggled to think up a new name beginning with aposCapos before their latest son was born. She told The Mirror: We couldnapost figure out a name and then Clayton just popped into my head. All the kids have names beginning with aposCapos and we wanted to keep that going. My husband is called Carlos... itaposs a tribute to him. The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  The mum said her latest pregnancy was her toughest yet, although despite this she is still open to having more children. Patty, who runs her own cleaning company, said she feels like her huge family is a aposblessingapos from God. She added: God has blessed us with all these kids, I know some people donapost agree and there are nasty comments online but for us itaposs a big blessing. I never thought I would have a big family until I started having babies. Then I thought aposthis is cool, why not apos Itaposs really fun.  If God wants us to have another child we will have another one. Carlos was by his weaposs side on May  when she delivered Clayton, who weighed lbs and  ounces. The mum was  weeks pregnant when she gave birth - her longest pregnancy yet - and she is still in hospital now. All my other births have been before  weeks. He just didnapost want to come out, she said.  The other children are anxious to meet their little brother. Iaposve been in hospital since Tuesday. They induced me on Tuesday and he came out on Wednesday. Patty said most of the nurses at the hospital recognised her when she went in for the delivery. They were like aposyou were here last year, we see you every yearapos, she said. Patty and her husband currently spend an eye-watering £ on food for their children every fortnight, however she stressed they do not receive any government support.

Customers often use the additional information option on food orders to tell the restaurant about allergies, or provide guidance to help find the address, but one customer wanted to see how far her driver would go to fulfil a request. A doorbell camera catches the moment the takeaway worker walks towards the front door carrying the pizzas in one hand and a drink bottle in the other, when he stops to read a handwritten note which had been left on the front door. It instructed the driver: Scream ‘Shannon your pizza is here.’ Don’t ring the doorbell or knock, our grandma is sleeping upstairs. After taking a few seconds to contemplate the request, which makes absolutely no sense, he looks around before stepping right up to the front door and absolutely bellowing Shannon in a voice loud enough to wake the entire neighbourhood, let alone poor grandma. He continues by screaming: Your pizza and before he can finish the sentence, the front door opens, but this does nothing to deter the professional from his job, as he finishes with an enormous is here right in the customeraposs face, holding the final note for a few seconds. The woman is left in stitches and thanks him for the impeccable service as he hands over the food, and the clip went viral after being shared on social media.

The religious figurehead has given his backing to the campaign urging pharmaceutical giants to suspend vaccine patents to boost supplies to poorer countries.In a video message to the Vax Live event, Francis backed “universal access to the vaccine and the temporary suspension of intellectual property rights”.And he added his condemnation of the “virus of inidualism” that “makes us indferent to the suffering of others”.“A iant of this virus is closed nationalism, which prevents, for example, an internationalism of vaccines,” he told Vax Live, an online charity concert, which was aired this weekend in aid of the international Covid vaccination effort. Do you support the calls for dropping Covid vaccine patents  Leave your comments below Despite being heavily pregnant, Meghan prepared a pre-recorded piece for coverage of the Vax Live concert.Meghan, who is expecting a girl this summer, spoke about issues concerning the Covid pandemic and the empowerment of women.The event follows experts fearing half a million cases per day could soon be recorded in India as hospitals run out of oxygen.  Along with the royals, Jenner Lopez, J Balvin, Foo Fighters and H.E.R. and appearances from celebrities like Chrissy Teigen, Gayle King, Ben Affleck supported the event, which took place on May .The Biden administration is also backing the campaign, which announced that it supported calls by India and South Africa – and many congressional Democrats – to drop intellectual property protections for Covid vaccines. “This is a global health crisis, and the extraordinary circumstances of the Covid- pandemic call for extraordinary measures,” said Katherine Tai, North America’s trade representative. “The administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for Covid- vaccines.” But the calls are being fiercely opposed by major drugmakers who argue it would set a precedent that could threaten future innovations, said Pfizer’s chief executive, Albert Bourla. A lack of vaccine manufacturing facilities was not the problem. “The restriction is the scarcity of highly specialised raw materials needed to produce our vaccine,” he argued.  Bourla said Pfizer’s vaccines required  dferent materials and components that were sourced from  countries. Without patent protections, companies would start competing for the same ingredients. The result would be disruptions to the flow of these precious raw materials, he argued.

I wouldn#t imagine there would be many clubs that have come out of the Championship and achieved that.“But we don#t believe the story is done yet and we#ll, hopefully, go to Hampden and get a positive result.”It#s not just the United boss who is up for the fight: his players are, too.Forget the carrot of European football, forget about the presence of Scotland boss Steve Clarke, all that should matter to the Terrors is cup glory.For Mellon, there is no need to motivate his troops, with the prize of kissing silver all the incentive they need.He continued: “Someone asked me after the last game: ‘Do you think you will be able to motivate the players for next weekend ’“I couldn’t believe that.

north-east catering company are opening their new delicatessen in a local town this summer.Husband and we Michael and Natalia McLeod began their careers in the catering industry in , producing wood-fired pizzas for galas and festivals with their firm The Wandering Oven.But keen to expand their offering, the couple rebranded last year and have been known as Wander and Graze ever since.They produce cheese and treat-based boxes, platters and grazing tables.Now Michael and Natalia are preparing to open their delicatessen, Wander and Graze # The Deli, which will offer up a range of quality local produce, cheese, cured meats, and much more.It will be part of a larger development being worked on in the area, known as the Courtyard at Chapelton.Natalia says the pair have always known they wanted to have their own space, whether it be a shop or not.#In the last year or so, we really grew on the idea of having a retail space,# she added. #It seems like the next natural step for our business to grow.#When we were delivering graze boxes throughout the pandemic, we quickly realised there was a high demand in the Chapelton area.#There also aren’t any shops in the village yet and people were always talking about how much they wanted a shop.#Michael and I soon put two and two together and knew Chapelton was the perfect place to set up shop.#We live in the village so reached out to the Elsick development committee and told them about our idea and they got back in touch straight away and the ball started rolling from there.#There will be lots of high-quality Scottish produce available at the delicatessen. The pair of us are very keen to use brands that we feel show off the best of what Scotland has to offer.#There is an unbelievable amount of local produce to choose from so we really are very lucky.#Our main offerings will be cheese, cured meats and other deli-style products such as olives, chutneys, crackers. We will also be stocking more everyday essential items such as milk, bread and eggs.#Michael and I will also be working with local bakers who will be supplying us with cakes. We have a great coffee stockist for fresh bags of coffee and there will be fantastic vegan and gluten-free offerings too.#Our pizzas will also be making a comeback. We will be announcing our brand new format later in the year.#Michael and Natalia aim to be open in late summer. If plans change, they have assured they will be keeping their following updated on social media.Natalia said: #Michael and I are very excited to move onto a bigger operation where we can take on more orders for platters and expand our offerings.#We are also looking forward to getting to know our customers and more people in the local community.#The pair of us are very happy to be able to offer some job opportunities too as we know many people have been hit with job losses due to the pandemic.#Overall, we can’t wait to get back to business and to continue growing as a company.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.59676318-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.59676318-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.59676318-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.59676318-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"covid cases rise by 200 in scotland with 23 in north east","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remCovid- cases in north-east have risen by  in the past  hours, the latest figures show.Across the same timeframe, case numbers in Scotland have also risen by , with no new deaths recorded.The Scottish Government has noted, however, that registry offices are closed at weekends, therefore, the zero figure may not be entirely accurate.The total confirmed as positive has risen by  to ,The number of deaths of patients who tested positive remains at ,Latest update ➡️ https:t.co bZPbrCoQuxHealth advice ➡️ https:t.co lrqArBQu pic aCqHKaYVmdash Scottish GovernmentMay , Of the new cases recorded by NHS Grampian, eight were identied in Aberdeen City with a further six in Aberdeenshire.Nine cases have also been recorded in Moray, where vaccination has been accelerated for those over the age of  in a bid to curb the outbreak there.The north-east#s total now stands at , cases since the beginning of the pandemic.Coronavirus in Scotland – track the spread in these charts and maps\" title\"#Coronavirus in Scotland – track the spread in these charts and maps# #

This will help move faster towards a low-carbon future, developing homegrown greener energy and reducing reliance on imported oil and gas.“It will ensure our changing industry continues to make an important economic contribution, supporting jobs and developing new careers and opportunities.”Along with her recommendations for the new parliament, Ms Michie paid tribute to the former minister for energy Paul Wheelhouse, who lost his bid to take constituency Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire.Speaking after the election results, Ms Michie said: “Paul Wheelhouse has been a champion of our industry and the energy sector as a whole, understanding as he did the importance of the industry to Scotland’s economy today and to being the backbone of the energy transition moving forward.“I’d like to thank him for the support and challenge he provided to us throughout his tenure as energy minister.“We look forward to meeting our new minister in the coming days and weeks, particularly as we continue to navigate the operational challenges of the coronavirus pandemic, while working to secure a fair transition for Scotland’s changing oil and gas industry.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/04/injecting-scotland-300x180.jpg class=attachment-part-medium size-part-medium wp-post-image ","title":"coronavirus in scotland here are the key demographics","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remWe’ve put together some regularly updating charts and maps showing the demographic information available on the people affected by the coronavirus pandemic in Scotland.The charts below show the distribution of deaths by age and gender.Given the way the virus transmits, we also looked at whether there was any link between the fatality rate and the population density.The NRS provides information on the number of deaths by smaller areas, known as intermediate zones, once per month.The chart below shows the proportion of deaths by location.This chart shows Covid- as a proportion of deaths each week in Scotland.The animated chart below shows where Covid- sits in the ranks of leading causes of death in Scotland.Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts\" title\"#Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts# #

We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of .  The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we’re delighted this funding means they can continue. Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet. This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le. It’s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans’ community give each other, helping each other through dficult time. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we’d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.Brian Sloan, Age Scotland chief executive "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 16 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Each route takes visitors on a real pilgrimage to ancient Christian landmarks, through remote and impressive landscapes.#Whilst Faith in Cowal is a Christian organisation, the routes are open to people of all faiths and none and provide the perfect way to connect with the wild beauty Cowal has to offer. Some of the sites that book-end each trail date as far back as the th and th centuries as well as more ancient landmarks such as Auchnaha Cairn that are thought to be Neolithic in origin.#The walks take in locations close to the major settlements and population centres of Cowal including Strachur, Dunoon, Kilfinan and Colintraive but they#re unlike any other path you#ll find. These are not all neatly manicured and waymarked trails. We have deliberately kept them dynamic and wild by making use of forestry roads and ancient heritage paths. Many of the routes require short, improvised hikes between paths so you#ll feel like a real pilgrim forging your way through the landscape.#There are detailed guides on our website as well as downloadable GPS tracks. We hope as many visitors to Cowal as possible will take this opportunity to step in the footsteps of ancient pilgrims and travellers, enjoy the wonderful scenery of Argyll and explore fascinating sites of genuine spiritual and religious importance,# added Dan.PICS:A map of the routes. no_aFootstepsFaithPhotos: subtlesensorHistoric Kilmun church, on the shores of the Holy Loch. no_aFootstepsFaith_©subtlesensor_Kilmorich graveyard, Cairndow. no_aFootstepsFaith_KilmorichGraveyard©subtlesensor"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 16 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

One of the highlights from last year’s event included celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by the lockdown for just over a year. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness has disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever. We are so grateful to all of our fundraisers who will be whipping up treats, enthusiasm, funds and giving their time for others – in a socially distanced way, of course – in what will be a very special and important Time for a Cuppa.For more information about Time for a Cuppa and how to host a tea party with our free fundraising pack, visit the dementiauk.org timeforacuppa webpage.Dr Hilda Hayo, Chief Admiral Nurse and Chief Executive Officer of Dementia UK."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead competitions galore","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Thursday night is shinty night in Lochgilphead, with the club holding primary school age coaching from pm to pm and combined men#s and women#s training from pm to .pm.The practicalities of travelling to away matches under Covid rules do, however, give cause for concern. #We can#t use a minibus as things stand and will have to use inidual cars for a -strong squad,# said Angus.#With seven players under  years of age in the squad, we will have to rely on the support of parents.#Kilmory has been placed in the Mowi South A regional league alongside Bute, Lochside, Taynuilt, Ballachulish and Inveraray second team.#There is tough competition in the league,# said Angus, #so with the number of young players we have it will be a case of getting the best team we can on the pitch every week, learning against good opposition and building for the future.#Inveraray#s first team will compete in Mowi Senior League C with Aberdour, Glasgow Mid Argyll, Kyles Athletic, Oban Camanachd and Oban Celtic.Inveraray players were non-contact training twice a week as soon as the rules allowed and club chairman Andrew McMurdo is pleased with their attitude. #I didn#t know what to expect, but the boys have been great and conscientious about the way they go about it. And socially it#s been good for them,# he said.#Both first and second teams are in challenging leagues, but it#s a good challenge. And with no relegation, we can experiment a bit and plan for next season.#Like every other aspect of le, shinty has had to be flexible and adapt to the pandemic, so hats off to the Camanachd Association for having the plans in place and implementing them so quickly.#New volunteers at Kilmory and Inveraray shinty clubs would also be welcome, particularly with the additional burden of meeting Covid requirements.Andrew McMurdo said: #No matter how big or small the task, more hands lighten the load, so we would appreciate the help of new volunteers.#PICS:Inveraray’s Andrew Fraser in yellow and black during a friendly match with Glasgow Mid Argyll in February  # one of the last matches before lockdown.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past  dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland’s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days. The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best, serving their customers.Re-opening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps to support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain.Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail ConsortiumThe reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints.Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers.Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.Tracey Gilbert, Usdaw deputy isional officer for ScotlandSir,Oxfam’s shops in Argyll and Bute have an urgent need for volunteers to help deal with an anticipated deluge of donations as they prepare to re-open from Monday April .Sales from the first day of trading following the re-opening of its English and Welsh shops were up  per cent on  figures, with it being the most successful Monday ever sales-wise for the organisation outwith Christmas periods.Money raised by the dedicated staff and volunteers in Oxfam#s shops in Dunoon and Rothesay helps fight poverty and injustice around the world providing people with lesaving essentials like clean water and soap as well as the hope of a better future.We know from the last lockdown that people will have taken the chance to have a good declutter and we’re anticipating a deluge of generous donations.Volunteers are asked to give as little as a few hours a week of their time and can take up a range of vital roles, from serving customers to sorting donations and arranging window displays.Each shop typically relies on a team of  dedicated volunteers and one or two staff, with more than , volunteers required across the country.As well as volunteers, Oxfam stores are also appealing for good quality donations.Protecting staff, volunteers and customers from Covid- remains Oxfam’s priority, with shop teams continuing to implement strict protocol, including social distancing, readily available hand sanitiser, masks and gloves for staff, screens at tills, regular and frequent cleaning, closed changing rooms and encouraging contactless payment.In advance of shops re-opening, people are invited to register their interest online via www.oxfam.org.uk # just click on #get involved#.Tom Richardson, Oxfam interim head of retailSir,The demands placed on Scotland’s health service by the pandemic have intensied pleas for an increase in funding for Scottish NHS.NHS funding in Scotland comes from the block grant from Westminster. If huge sums of Scottish taxpayers’ money were not being used to pay Scotland’s share of renewing and maintaining Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet, there would be funds available to properly support the Scottish NHS. This will only be possible when Scotland is independent once more.Susan Swain, Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"self help bike workshop opens in tayvallich","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Our pretty Highlander girls have lost all interest in us now that the grass and rashes are a vivid, succulent green. They graze far and wide, ignoring their hay ring breakfast bar where they jostled and queued all winter.The sheep roam around the cattle’s hairy feet, no longer mooching for scraps from their breakfast table. So, it’s an easier morning round for us crofters with only the daft pigs to feed, who long ago foraged every root, acorn and pine-cone from their sizeable woodland.Their little forest is perfectly, porcinely ploughed, but they must still be finding some nourishment there as they seem less frantic at feeding-time, pausing their grubbling and guzzling for the occasional scratch and cuddle.The let-up in winter feeding has allowed much-needed attention to be given to the now stuffed-full Polycrub where every speck of soil, every hanging beam has been usefully employed in the mission to feed the family entirely from its harvest.Raspberry canes, lemon, orange and cherry trees should keep rickets at bay, while the plethora of weird and wonderful ieties of carrots, potatoes, asparagus, and squashes will nourish us throughout the season and beyond.Our newbie attempts to live off the land mirror the much more experienced efforts of families throughout theand breadth of this peninsula and in the village beyond. Thanks to those techie neighbours who set up email networks and social media groups there is a fantastic bank of information and expertise shared locally.Whether you want to learn how to plant oak trees, acquire foraging skills or find out how to run your home on renewable energy, somebody local has been there, done it and is happy to point you in the right direction.Over the last few months this valuable mine of knowledge and enthusiasm for environmental projects has been formalised into the Tayvallich Sustainability Plan, a  for sharing information and taking action to create a more sustainable community.The plan has grown organically from a pilot scheme run through the winter months with Keep Scotland Beautul to a website, action plan and monthly activities.Open to everyone with an interest in achieving a healthy, sustainable future for the village and its surroundings, the plan will work on the whole gambit: from food growing to flood mitigation foraging to forestry and heat pumps to bike pumps # a new cycle repair work-stand has been installed outside the village shop.Joining the online meetings throughout the winter, I was amazed to see not just the number of locals involved, but also the extraordinary talents and interests they share.We only entrenched ourselves full time on this wild wee bit of Argyll a month or two before lockdown so we’re not well-kent faces and, likewise, the faces of many villagers I’ve only ever seen strangely pixellated thanks to my dodgy connection to the Zoom meetings.Hopefully the same is true for wi throughout the area and that my, now ubiquitous, Zoom-accompanying glass of wine has stayed safely out of shot."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 30 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"julie-forrest-borders-bowler-wins-world-championships-title","story":"BORDERS bowler Julie Forrest has won a world championship title with her mixed pairs partner Stewart Anderson.Competing in the World Indoor Bowls Championships, Forrest and Anderson won the final todayagainst Carla Banks and reigning open singles champion Robert Paxton.Forrest, from Hawick, and compatriot Anderson secured a -

Most important was keeping in touch with you through my surgeries: in supermarkets, libraries, and my annual summer surgery tour through the villages. This past year of course has changed everything. We have all been stuck at home keeping in touch through emails. COVID has dominated and I have tried to help you with the problems it brought in its wake. Moving now through vaccination, queries arise as you await that appointment. At the same time other issues continue: unsuitable housing, planning concerns. This is the essential work and duty of an MSP to constituents no matter what their politics. I hope I have discharged that duty. I have also chaired the parliamentrsquos cross-party group on animal welfare for many years with two Bills to my name: The Control of DogsAct , now law, putting the blame on the owner not the dog and The Welfare of DogsBill which aims to end casual purchase of puppies. COVID prevented it proceeding butelected I intend to bring it back, especially with concern that some of those \"COVID\" puppies will end up in animal rescue centres. Yes, how le has changed, COVID has been hard: losing a business built over years, living with children trapped in a flat, not attending a funeral, delaying the wedding, the new baby not socialising with family. The list is endless of the sacrices, the losses. COVID has broken the link with the way we were, just as those World Wars changed society.

The past year has been tough for us all. Many of us have struggled with the pressures of lockdown, myself included. But the way to recover from this pandemic is not to launch into another constitutional argument that threatens our livelihoods, our childrenrsquos futures and our way of le.As a mum to two lovely boys, I want to see a government that puts aside its own agenda and commits to focusing on whatrsquos best for the next generation of Scots. ldquoJudge me on my record said Nicola Sturgeon on education.

It would seem the First Minister has been found wanting.Itrsquos not just our schools that under threat other public services are too. As leader of the Scottish Borders Council, I have fought tirelessly against repeated cuts to our budget, forcing councillors to make dficult choices simply because the Scottish Government finds it easier to pass the buck. After the strain of COVID, we need a Scottish Government that will step up, empower councils and work with them, not against them.Butthe SNP gain enough seats to form a majority in May then all that is at risk. Once again, they will push for another isive referendum.There is only one way to stop that: lend me your constituency vote, and the Scottish Conservatives your party vote, on May .ACMay AC May, Scottish Liberal DemocratsI intend to represent you the only way I know how - by working tirelessly with a keen eye on the future to ensure that there is investment and improvement in education, employment opportunities and business growth. I will stand up for better funded healthcare and demand that money is directed towards care homes, mental health and wellbeing to bring these up to the standards we all deserve. To do this will need a strong economy and the Scottish Liberal Democrats are putting recovery first ndash this must be Scotlandrsquos priority. A vote for me is a vote of confidence for a more secure future for you and your families.Its time for a change. The area needs someone who will heed the concerns of constituents, and voice these strongly in parliament, not just another person sitting in Holyrood applauding every word of the First Minister.Prior to the boundary changes, the Scottish Liberal Democrats had a long record of success here, and its high-time for ato rational, clear thinking on the issues that matter locally and nationally.Our high streets and town centres ndash the beating heart of our communities ndash need urgent help. This was apparent before the pandemic, but even more so now. Online commerce can bring tremendous benefits and is here to stay. Many businesses have transformed to the new normal, but many others have struggled. We need to focus on how growing online spend can coexist with a vibrant local economy, and work to restore community feeling.Im looking forward to getting stuck into the campaign. By their own admission, a ided Tory party has mishandled Brexit, driving Scottish voters in desperation towards nationalism, while the opportunist and populist SNP seeks to compound the disaster of Brexit by withdrawing from the UK completely, just at the point when we need economic recovery the most.A vote for me is a vote for progress through strong partnerships within Scotland, across the UK and with our European neighbours, so that together we can recover from the COVID crisis and move beyond the politics of ision.Katherine Sangster Katherine Sangster, Scottish LabourCOVID-rsquos impact on our families, our communities and our economy has been profound. We now need to start the hard work of rebuilding our country and that task needs new faces, fresh ideas and experience outside of Holyrood.I am a working parent who prior to  had never been involved in politics. However, I like many other parents soon realised that the SNPrsquos childcare policies sound good on the back of an election leaflet but donrsquot work in practice. So, in , I campaigned for fairer access to childcare and led Fair Funding for our Kids - a nationwide campaign that got childcare on to the national agenda, building a movement of mums that demanded action from Government. Our campaign secured more funded childcare from Government - a step towards equality, but there is still plenty to be done.Soon, I was speaking on television, writing for newspapers and lobbying politicians. All things I has never done before but I was speaking from the heart and articulating mine and othersrsquo experience. Now with five years plus experience in politics I still firmly believe that policy is best made by those with lived experience and the job of a politician is to listen and advocate on peoples behalf, and I will always put that at the heart of what I do.Working for an MP now, every day I support people with the issues that blight their lives from poor housing to an inhumane benefits system to bins not getting picked up. These are issues that affect people day in day out. Chatting to voters and speaking to constituents, I have experienced no appetite for debate on a second referendum just a desire from people that we as politicians and aspiring politicians listen to their concerns and respond to those concerns.We need to elect MSPs to Holyrood who understand these concerns and will fully use the powers of the Scottish Parliament to make peoplersquos lives better. Holyrood is one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world lets start using those powers. As Donald Dewar said at the opening of the Scottish Parliament in  ldquoA Scottish Parliament, not an end but a means to greater ends.On May  please use your vote carefully and letrsquos start the task of uniting our country behind our national recovery."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-bank-holiday-offers-big-mac-mcchicken-sandwich","story":"Have you enjoyedthe Bank Holiday weekend a bit too

Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past thirteen dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland#s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days.The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best — serving their customers.Reopening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain. Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.The reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints. Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers. Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.The national charity for older people is encouraging people to get moving every day next month as part of a new fundraising activity challenge.Throughout May, Age Scotland is asking people across the country to Spring into Action to help support older people in Scotland.Fundraisers can take part however they choose, but the most important thing is to make sure they are active every day.All funds raised by Spring into Action participants will go towards Age Scotland#s vital services, including the national friendship line, which offers a place older people can turn tothey are in need of support, comfort and reassurance or even just missing a friendly voice.Running and walking events have always been a great way to help raise vital funds and, even with many regular events unfortunately cancelled over the past year, we#ve been overwhelmed by the kindness and generosity shown by fundraisers still going above and beyond.We hope to see as many people as possible taking up our challenge to Spring into Action this May. With nights getting lighter and better weather on the horizon, this is a great excuse to get out and about and support a worthy cause at the same time.#Whether you run one mile, walk five, or design your own challenge, your fundraising efforts will be making a real dference for older people in Scotland.#The money you raise will fund vital services like our friendship line.

Online records showed his birthplace as #Inchial Argileshire#, which turned out to be the parish of Glenorchy and Inishail at the head of Loch Awe.Alexander McNab was born there to Alexander senior and Margaret McNab in  — one of a family of three brothers and four sisters — and moved south to Burnley in Lancashire in the s. In Lancashire in , he married Janet Wardrope, who came from Milngavie outside Glasgow, and they went on to have  children.Going back a few generations, Clare#s research has traced Alexander#s great grandfather, John McNab, born in Kilbrandon in the area around Loch Melfort in .His son Peter, born around , went on to farm in Connel and is recorded in the  census as an -year-old, farming  acres at South Ledaig, though is described as a #smith# in an earlier record.Born in , Peter#s son Alexander grew up to work in farming around Glenorchy. In the  census he is recorded as a ploughman at Barbreck.#Our# Alexander seems to have been a blacksmith when he moved from Argyll to Burnley to start a new le.Sadly, two of Alexander and Janet#s family died as young children.Later, however, they found themselves — like so many other families — caught up in the horrors of the First World War.They lost three sons — Andrew, aged , missing in action,  Alex, , missing in action,  and John, , missing in action,  — during the war.The grief the family must have borne is unimaginable. The boys# names are recorded on three separate First World War memorials in Belgium and France.Clare said: #What a tragedy losing your sons. Andrew, Alex and John were brothers of my great grandma, Grace McNab Bridge.#Alexander died in  at the age of , after being hit by a tramcar in Blackpool during the blackout. He was living with daughter Grace and her family at the time. A short newspaper report from the time describes him as a #retired blacksmith#.Clare was born in Blackpool and moved to Tees-side, via a spell in Dumfries, through her husband David#s employment.Though her great grandmother Grace passed away in , Clare believes she can detect echoes of the past in her own family today.She explained: #My son, who is in army, has just trained in music and learnt the bagpipes.#Little bits keep popping up. My other son is into blacksmithing, which is also in the family.#And while she has never visited Argyll, Clare would love to at some point once Covid restrictions have eased.#I had a look at images of Loch Awe and have been reading up about the area.

A big decision has been swept under the carpet.#The budget was reduced by £,, from £, to £,.Douglas Hendry, executive director of customer services, said: #Our process is not to fund routes where there is alternative transport available or where there are less than , people travelling annually.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOPiper#s march wins prizeThe Campbeltown piper who won a competition to compose a tune to mark a battle in which many of his comrades fought was presented with his prize on Tuesday # the battle#s rd anniversary.Mr George McIntyre from Meadowburn won a competition run by the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders to compose a   march in memory of the Battle of Longstop Hill in .On Tuesday, Longstop Day, Major Hamish Clarkof the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders travelled to Campbeltown to present George with a specially engraved quaich at a ceremony at the Argyll Hotel.Many Kintyre men fought at the battle which was one of the decisive moments in the Second World War against the Germans in North Africa.Major Duncan McMillan, who won the Military Medal at the battle, attended the ceremony along with many of George#s other old army friends.Before he handed the quaich to George, Major Clark said: #I really can#t think of anyone more appropriate to have won the competition than George McIntyre himself.#If George had not been taken prisoner in  he may well have fought at Longstop.#Receiving the quaich, George said: #It gives me great honour to achieve this.#Then Mr Ian McKerral from Kintyre and District Pipe Band gave the first public performance of the tune.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe end of the road for PaulPaul McCartney, who is at the moment staying at High Park Farm, Campbeltown, has just made one giant step forward towards severing all his connections with the other three Beatles.John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr abandoned their appeal against a High Court order on Monday, putting the affairs of their company, Apple, in the hands of a receiver. The three now face a legal costs bill estimated at £,.Mr Morris Finer, QC for John, George, Ringo and Apple, told the appeal court on Monday that they now considered it was in the common interest to explore ways of allowing Paul to free himself from the partnership by agreement.Mr David Hurst QC on behalf of Paul said: #He will most willingly enter into the proposed negotiations to achieve his freedom from the partnership by consent rather than by court action.#Well, it looks very much like the end of the #long and winding road# to quote a well known McCartney ballad.What does Paul himself feel about the rise and fall of the Beatles Two Courier men drove up to High Park Farm — which has a long and decidedly bumpy road leading to it — to find out what the man in the centre of it all felt about things.Apart from being obviously excited about his latest and most important success, Paul did not like saying anything about the matter.Though very polite and friendly, he made it quite clear that he does not see any point in giving interviews or saying anything remotely sensational.After ten years of being harried and hustled by journalists and photographers never having a minute#s peace to himself always having been the centre of attraction never having been able to pop in to the #local#, is it any wonder that Paul is determined to live as quietly as possible He seemed as happy as a sand-boy, out there in the wilds.When we approached him, he had obviously been brushing down one of his horses because he still held a horse brush in his hand.His we Linda looked the essence of happiness as her golden hair mirrored the warm sunshine. The children yelled and gurgled contentedly and even Martha, the English sheepdog, seemed happy.The farm house itself has been extensively renovated, a new roof having been constructed and the farm work appears to be progressing normally.Paul himself has changed. Outwardly at any rate. Gone is the Beatle mop, the style which was copied the whole word over. Gone is the boyish grin, which once sent screaming thousands into ecstasy.What has taken the place of these characteristics  Paul now sports a beard the hair remains longish but it is brushed back, revealing the full extent of his forehead the smile is no longer boyish.The former bass-guitarist song-writer with the most influential and certainly most famous foursome the world has ever known has changed.Paul will probably continue to compose such brilliant songs as Maybe I#m Amazed and Another Day but to millions of people, from Campbeltown to Honolulu, pop music will certainly never be the same again.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and flashesThere would be some fluttering this week among the ladies in the town who are liable to serve on a jury, summonses to appear on the occasion of a forthcoming jury trial having been issued to  ladies and  gentlemen.

If you are taking a long-term view then a garden full of reliable flowering shrubs is also an option.Whatever garden you have, watering and weeding are the key watchwords for May. It is essential to water newly planted fruit trees, roses and shrubs regularly to help their root systems get established.It is also the time of year when many plants# demand for water increases as they start their major growth period. Top watering tips include – every time you plant something, water it in well, make a moat of soil round newly planted plants so that water doesn#t run off and goes to the roots, water pots and containers so that water appears right to the top of the pot and get a water butt.If you have a drainpipe, you have a natural water supply so a simple garden solution for May is to ensure that you have adequate water storage. If you buy and fit a water butt, it will provide you with water for the garden in an environmentally friendly way and on a regular basis.Annual weeds will be popping up now, so weeding borders once a week to prevent weed seedlings establishing is a good idea. The problem with the most common weeds such as nettles, dandelions and bindweed, is that they are very, very tough. They can continue to grow in conditions that make most garden plants simply fade away – and they do that, in part, by using the moisture, nutrients and light of the plants around them.A great plant to get you into the summer gardening spirit is the pretty petunia – perfect for containers and hanging baskets and a great choice for instant colour. It can flower all summer long, providing you deadhead regularly, and comes in a iety of colours to suit any garden palette.Petunias are also available in dferent blooms including single, double, ruffled or smooth petals. They can be striped, veined or solid in colour and most sold today are hybrids developed for specic design purposes such as fragrance.They need full sun and can#t tolerate frost but can grow in a wide range of soils and thrive in multipurpose compost when planted in containers.Keeping on top of garden maintenance is crucial in May. The garden is coming alive so there is plenty to keep you busy.

Their father Stephen, aged , is in his th year of service with the crew.His father Robert is now aged  and, before retiring, he served  years and his father, the late Robert Scally senior, served for  years.The sea is in the Scally family blood Stephen senior, who is also the Campbeltown harbour master, was a fisherman, as was his father.#My grandfather was a fisherman and he met my grandmother at Mallaig, where she was one of the herring lasses who followed the fishing fleet as it followed the herring around the coast,# said Stephen senior. #Her family came from Peterhead and all her brothers were fishermen.#None of the latest generation of Scallys to serve is a fisherman.Between them, the Scally family have served on Campbeltown leboats City of Glasgow, City of Glasgow II, Walter and Margaret Cooper and Ernest and Mary Shaw.Stephen Scally senior and Robert Scally are both recipients of the institute#s bronze medal for bravery and both are qualied coxswains.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOGerman giant to call in the Wee ToonGermany#s flagship passenger cruise ship is to visit Campbeltown next summer with up to  passengers on board, it was revealed this week.The Hamburg-based MS Europa will be docking in the town for six hours on Wednesday July  next year, during a voyage around the British Isles.The cruiser, owned by German shipping firm Hapag-Lloyd, is  metres high and nearly  metres long.It carries between  and  passengers.It will dock in the loch around midday and leave for Oban at pm. Campbeltown Harbour Office said that the Europa was #arguably the biggest boat to come into Campbeltown for a long time#.The chairperson of Campbeltown Community Council, Mrs Nancie Smith, hoped a special gala day could be organised to mark the ship#s visit.She said: #This is an opportunity we should grasp with both hands. I anticipate there will be some form of civic entertainment laid on.#Mrs Smith added that she hoped many shops in the centre of town would not close for the half day to make the visitors feel welcome.She told the Courier: #It is important that the visitors see the town looking at its best and we hope this will be supported by all the businesses and shops which will stay open for business that day.#The local director of Argyll, the Isles, Loch Lomond, Stirling and the Trossachs Tourist Board, Mr Bruce Urquhart, hailed the Europa#s planned visit as a great opportunity for Campbeltown.FIFTY YEARS AGOFarmer#s heroic effort to save barnFire dealt a cruel blow to a local farmer yesterday afternoon, for the second time in three years.As fire fighting units raced from Campbeltown, a barn at Low Tirfergus Farm near Drumlemble was ablaze from end to end. Flames were fanned by a fresh easterly breeze.And despite a heroic effort by the farmer, Mr Roderick Morrison, son-in-law of the farm#s owner Mr A Barker, the fire had a firm hold by the time the fire brigade arrived.The alarm was raised by Mr Morrison#s we who alerted him.Armed with a pitchfork, Mr Morrison tried to separate the blazing straw, which was being used as feeding, from the rest of the barn#s contents, but it was in vain.Firemen had to jump clear as the roof caved in with a tremendous crash.The straw inside the barn was totally destroyed.The £ barn was erected three years ago after  tons of hay and  tons of straw were destroyed in a blaze at the same farm.It stood on its own, some distance from the other farm buildings.Labour back in control – by one seatLabour retained control of Campbeltown Town Council at Tuesday#s municipal elections, though they lost one seat to the Progressives.The composition of the council now reads: Labour nine seats, Progressive eight seats.Provost Daniel McKinven and Councillor Edward Scragg, who formerly sat under the Independent Socialist and SBP banners respectively, fought the contest as Progressives. Both were re-elected.And -year old William Crossan, of Kinloch Road, Campbeltown, became the youngest member ever to sit in the council chambers.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCoal strikeAttention should be paid to the announcement in our advt. columns regarding the pressure of gas from the local works, special arrangements commencing on Saturday night with the object of conserving the stock of coal.A coal laden schooner, carrying about  tons of household coal, which arrived here just at the beginning of the coal strike and was prohibited from discharging by the customs authorities, had the embargo removed this week, the cargo being transferred to one of the local coal merchants.One hundred tons dished out in half-cwt lots, which is the household allowance for a week, will help a bit to keep the home fires burning.The coal fight drags on without the smallest sign of either side giving way. Apparently the nation will have to suffer much more before a settlement is reached, and unfortunately there is no very clear guarantee that even a settlement of the coal dispute would restore us to anything like prosperity.Every minute of the clock-round stocks are being reduced, andthe dispute lasts much longer, the miners will produce a general lock-out of their fellow-workers, which will have all the dire effects of a general strike without any of its heroics. It is a deplorable situation."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

That much is obvious from her work at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, as well as performances in bands including Rhuvaal, one of Scotland#s fastest rising young traditional groups.It is moving that Alex chose to use that talent not only to pay tribute to Robert Black, someone who inspired her passion, but to raise money to help with the costs of operating the helipad named in his memory.We#re sure it#s not the last we#ll hear about Alex#s career in music.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The children used their maps to hide flags and challenge each other.The children benefited greatly from this visit and were keen to show their fellow explorers all the places they visit weekly with the class teacher.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Any forward player will tell you that. If you have a terrible game and score a goal or play fantastic and not score ndash you are judged on your goals as a forward.ldquoHopefully, I will get another goal but I need to make sure I am in the team. I would love another goal and I love the Scottish Cup. I loved it with East Kilbride and Gala Fairydean Rovers ndash it is great and you love those big moments in competitions.Paton moved from Dublin to East Lothian after signing for Hibs around his th birthday.He lived with Helen Leslie and her two sons, Darren and Jonathan, off Tranentrsquos Waterloo Road and attended Ross High School, where he studied physical education, English and sports leadership.The striker was quick to praise both the family and the school for helping him develop. He said: ldquoThey took me in asI was part of their family.ldquoThey were absolutely fantastic to me and made me feel so welcome.ldquoI went for dinner with them and they were brilliant.ldquoIn my first year, I spoke to Sean McPartlin, education and welfare officer, and he askedI wanted to do something. I agreed to it and they said I would train some days.ldquoIt is the best thing I ever did.That saw Paton ide his time between attending school and training at Hibernian Training Centre at East Mains on the outskirts of Ormiston.The -year-old spent two years at the secondary school and told Courier Sport how much he enjoyed the experience. He added: ldquoIt was brilliant ndash the best thing I ever did, honestly.ldquoI was not too keen going to school at that age with football andI had not then I would not have made many friends. The amount of people I met through school was unbelievable.Paul Reynolds, headteacher of the Tranent secondary school, said: ldquoNot only was Ruari a standout footballer, he was a true gentleman.ldquoHe was always extremely polite and his positive attitude was infectious.

resident said: ldquoThere were very few Musselburgh records in Register House, and they were supposed to have been lost, but a few years ago they were discovered in a locked room in the town hall in Musselburgh.ldquoThere was a real treasure trove of old burgh records, including two court books.The rediscovered records were moved to Haddingtonrsquos John Gray Centre, where David read through them to look for witchcraft trials.He found two cases, from , of young women named Jonet Little and Agnes Mitchell who were found guilty of witchcraft and sentenced to be strangled then burnt.David said: ldquoThat was the stock punishment for witchcraft. People run away with the idea that witches in Scotland were burnt alive but that is nonsense. They were strangled at the stake and then their corpse was burned.The records of their trial quoted the ldquodiabolic charms the women were said to have used ndash actually Catholic prayers.David said: ldquoThere were references to the Virgin Mary and to the saints and angels, which was not the sort of thing the new Protestant church in Scotland liked to hear about.ldquoThey thought these Catholic prayers were so beyond the pale they could be used to invoke the Devil.

The path zigzagged down to the river and within a couple of minutes they reached the edge of the pool.It wasnrsquot quite what he had expected: a bulge in the river, where the flow of the peaty water slowed, making a deep and calm natural basin. Finn stared at the deep brown water, it was too dark to see anything underneath the surface. It had an almost eerie feeling to it, yet at the same time was quietly inviting.ldquoThis is a place of myth making and history, Izzy said as she sat by the riverbank to set up her stove. Soon its hissing filled the air. She sipped her coffee, waiting for Finn to join her. He took an apple from her rucksack and sat next to her. He wanted to know about this place.ldquoIt was probably a sacred place even before St Fillan and Christianity came here, she said. She explained how the early Celts venerated water and places such as this were associated with their gods and of the spirituality within nature itself.Then she told him stories about St Fillan of how his ox was killed by a wolf, but that afterwards the wolf ed. The saint forgave the creature and to make amends it agreed to be yoked and pull the plough that had been the job of the ox.Finn spoke up: ldquoBut the wolf didnrsquot do anything wrong, surely  It was a wolf after all and the ox was prey, itrsquos what wolves do.ldquoThatrsquos true, Finn, but it is a tale made to show how miraculous his god was. There were many of them. Another was that St Fillan had a bell that could magically fly and also his left arm could shine in the dark, giving him light to read and write at night.ldquoHe sounds more like a superhero, remarked Finn.Izzy chuckled: ldquoYeah, I suppose that was the idea, it was a way of showing people the power of god and of course people at the time really believed these stories. St Fillanrsquos arm bone became a relic called the Mayne, and there is a story that it was taken to Bannockburn on the orders of Robert the Bruce to help him win the battle.Finn knew about Robert the Bruce and wanted to hear the tale of the Mayne. Izzy told it with humour, how the arm bone appeared miraculously, to the surprise of the abbot, who had been afraid to bring it in case it got lost.Finn looked at the pool: ldquoSo according to these stories, he used his powers to make the water here magical ldquoYep, said Izzy, drinking the last of her coffee. ldquoItrsquos mostly forgotten now, but for hundreds of years this was a place of pilgrimage where people came to be cured. The water was said to cure people of mental health problems. She explained the bizarre ritual of how people were submerged in the pool and given the task of finding stones from the river bed, then spent a night tied up in the nearby priory.Finn laughed out loud at the image of it all.Well, I donrsquot believe the stories, said Finn, ldquobut Irsquod still like to swim in the pool and seeI can find some stones.Izzy knew she would have to go in with him. She had brought their swimming gear and towels just in case, and soon they were howling and shrieking as they lowered themselves into the cold water. Within a minute, their bodies numbed to it and they began to swim.Trees lined both banks and they got a good view of the modern bridge further up the river. Finn watched as cars, tour buses and campervans sped over it, passing without a glance.He stayed in the water longer than his aunt, swimming in circles, then exploring the far side of the river. He managed to get three pebbles from the shallower section of the pool on its eastern edge. As he emerged shivering, the sun suddenly broke through the clouds, giving welcome and timely warmth as he dried himself.ldquoI get it now, said Finn, laughing. ldquoYou actually have to be mad to go in there in the first place!He studied the stones in his hand, then looked up: ldquoI know a story about Robert the Bruce.He told his story wrapped in a large towel, his hair still wet and dripping. It was the story of Bruce and the spider, and he told it beautully, under the shade of the birch trees next to the ancient healing pool. The only interruption was birdsong. Now Izzy was the listener and Finn the storyteller. It was an incredibly special moment.ldquoItrsquos a story about not giving up, explained Finn after hersquod finished telling it. ldquoMaybe it didnrsquot happen exactly that way, but itrsquos still got truth in it. He gave his aunt a big smile.His words spoke directly to her, in a way he wouldnrsquot understand. She glanced towards the trees for a moment, then ed Finnrsquos big smile.ldquoFantastic telling, Finn. And you know what  One of the battles he was defeated in took place just over there, at a place called Dalrigh, the field of the king. She pointed to beyond the bridge. ldquoHe was being hunted by his enemies and nearly got killed in the battle. At least he escaped with his le to later meet the spider! According to legend, he threw his sword into a small loch as he fled. His followers did the same and itrsquos been called Lochan nam Arm ever since, which means loch of the weapons. Some say Brucersquos sword still lies in the mud there, which is why people also call it the Loch of the Sword.Finn was excited by this connection. He wanted to see the loch, maybe he could even find the sword! Hersquod once been to Bannockburn visitor centre, it had been a fun day out. But here, history felt so much closer, more real, although he couldnrsquot put into words why.Izzy agreed they could have lunch at Lochan nam Arm. As she packed up, Finn stood by the waterrsquos edge and dropped one of the pebbles back into the pool. He watched as the circular ripples expanded on the calm surface, finally vanishing. He did the same with the second pebble, again watching the ripples the splash had made.Then he spoke, while still studying the water.ldquoMy dad once told me that le is a stone thrown into the water: it leaves ripples long after it has vanished.Izzy froze, saying nothing in case she chose the wrong words.Finn looked at the third stone still in his hand. Instead of throwing it into the water, he hurled it into the wood. It bounced off the trunk of a birch tree, then fell into the undergrowth.ldquoBut he was wrong because some stones just vanish, like that one, thatrsquos all they do, because they are not worth anything. Finnrsquos mood had suddenly changed.ldquoI hated that stone, he said with anger in his voice.Izzy stood up. ldquoFinn, she said softly, holding out her arms, offering a hug.He just turned and walked up the path towards the car, picking up a stick and hitting the trees with it.ldquoI hate him, I hate him, he screamed.Izzyrsquos stomach sank. Her mind raced over what had happened, what had been the trigger, was it something she had said Then she realised.She walked up the path and found Finn by the car, looking out to the mountains which now framed the near horizon all around them.ldquoYou OK, sweetie  You want to talk Finn shook his head.ldquoI want to phone my mum, he eventually replied.ldquoOf course, therersquos a phone at Tyndrum, just down the road. Letrsquos seewe can get hold of her, it will be nearly lunchtime where she is, so maybe she will be free.Finn noticed the sign for Dalrigh, then minutes later they arrived at Tyndrum.Luckily, Finnrsquos mum was able to come to the phone.As Finn spoke with his mum, Izzy saw Ewen pull up at the petrol station. He was in a dferent car and wearing a jacket with a hood half pulled over his face, but she knew it was him. He was being very careful, as shersquod asked him to be. She didnrsquot know how much hersquod seen and heard by the pool.How to tell him shersquod decided it may be best to abandon the whole trip, take Finn back home and wait there for his mum and stepdad to . It just felt too risky and she was worried about Finn. She knew Ewen would be devastated.Finn hung up and seemed happier after the call.ldquoI was thinking we might head back to your home today, Finn. You know, with lights and TV and normal stuff, said Izzy with a smile and a wink.Finnrsquos reaction wasnrsquot what she expected.ldquoWhy, aunty  Irsquom sorry I got angry, but Irsquom OK now. You promised me an adventure to Loch Ness, why are you giving up and breaking your promise So they walked to Lochan nam Arm. Izzy told the story of Brucersquos escape from the MacDougalls and they both made lunch together by a patch of late flowering foxgloves. Some walkers on the West Highland Way passed them, but mostly they had the loch side to themselves.Finn didnrsquot find the sword of Robert the Bruce, of course. But he did find something .Here are the links to chapters one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ,  and ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-scrap-popular-items-menu-make-way-5-new-offerings","story":"Fast food lovers will know, the UKrsquos most popular burger chain regularly updates its menu throughout the year with promotions to keep their offerings fresh.From this week, McDonaldrsquos has unveiled five new items that will be available to customers until mid-June.The new products will be part of the chains menu from May  to June  meaning you will only have a short time to sample their new offerings.One of the items making ais a firm favourite among McDonaldrsquos lovers, the Bacon Clubhouse Double.The burger consists of two % beef patties, two rashers of Beechwood smoked bacon, a slice of cheddar cheese, onions, tomato, lettuce, and sauce.Another item being added to the menu is the Chicken Deluxe Sandwich.A chicken option consisting of two crunchy Chicken Selects, Emmental cheese, lettuce, red onions, tomato relish, and mayonnaise.

We cannot manage what we cannot measure, which is why it is often left out of the carbon equation.:Claire Taylor: Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureThis could all be about to change. Last week saw the launch of a global farm metric ndash a common benchmark to measure the sustainability of food and farming. I attended a TEDx event hosted by the Sustainable Food Trust which is leading a new coalition to establish a standardised approach for assessing the sustainability credentials of dferent farms. A common toolkit which will be rolled out internationally and will allow us to present a harmonised approach to measuring and managing agriculturersquos global emissions.Finally, the role our grasslands play in storing carbon will be properly recorded and recognised for their valuable contribution towards our journey to net zero emissions. It is now up to the next Scottish Government to embrace this global farm metric and start recognising farming as part of the solution.Farming practices will have to change to be part of this journey and I believe from speaking to farmers and reading the manestorsquos of dferent farming organisations that they are ready and up to the challenge, but this sht in production will require long term commitments over future funding.If farmers are going to be tasked with producing more environmentally friendly food which comes with a higher price tag, this has to be reflected in the value of food or  farmers will continue to need subsidies in order to keep food affordable for the public.Farmers today are producing food which is sold at the same price as it was  years ago. The same certainly canrsquot be said for the price of clothing, petrol or house prices.If we as consumers really value a future where low carbon produce becomes a staple in our shopping baskets, then we might have to start footing some of the bill.We all go into our local supermarket with the moral intentions of choosing food which supports good animal welfare and boasts environmental protections, but % of us go in and buy based on price.Food is cheap and we are so disconnected from the way it is produced that we often donrsquot value it and think nothing of throwing it away. Why  do we allow % of UK food to end up in the bin But are we lazy consumers with a disregard for seasonality and the origins of our food, or is it simply that we are overwhelmed by too much choice on the shelves that we canrsquot begin to understand the impact of our purchases :Claire Taylor: Blue Peter has no right to push an anti-meat agendaWe all might recognise a free-range egg label or red tractor assurance mark, but do we really feel equipped to make informed choices on the sustainability of our purchases  I back the proposals by the Scottish Greens and the SNP to introduce carbon labelling, but will it not all ultimately come back to a case of price During the TEDx event, the Chief Executive of Morrisonrsquos explained: ldquoChoice often means the balance between price and quality, price and provenance, price and healthier ingredients, but it always comes down to price.Morrisonrsquos have a clever solution to remove the pressure from consumers and place the onus on themselves to provide sustainable produce on their shelves. In March they announced that they would only be supplied by net zero carbon farms by  and will be working with their  farmers and growers to produce affordable net zero carbon meat, fruit, vegetables, and eggs. This takes away the uncertainty and ambiguity for its customers.As a nation emerging from a pandemic with rising levels of poverty and social inequality, we cannot expect the public to be putting sustainability at the top of their list, but longer term the responsibility will have to be shared by consumers.We as the public need to play our part in tackling the climate emergency and committing to responsible food choices is a good place to start. We need to start valuing the produce on our shelves and nipping in the bud the throwaway culture which has resulted from our disconnect.There is an urgency to rebuild our relationship with food and our understanding of how it Is produced. All roads lead back to education, and by introducing sustainable food production as part of the national curriculum will equip the next generation with the knowledge to make responsible food choices.Constitutional issues cannot be allowed to dominate and ide discussion over the next five years. A collaborative approach is needed to properly address and tackle the looming climate emergency and how our food is produced, purchased, and consumed has to be front and centre of policy decisions."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12582710.jpg?type=article-full","title":"skye-kate-spiers-islands-charms","story":"Where is it Skye.Why do you go there Ive only ever been there for work and once with a friend for a quick overnight trip, but from my first visit I fell in love.

His success in photographing these notoriously shy creatures lies partly in his ability to blend silently into the seascape, becoming indistinguishable from a rock or clump of weed.Yet on a subliminal level, Howard appears to speak the animalsrsquo language. ldquoYou have to think like an otter to succeed in photographing or spending time with them, he says.The Highlands-based naturalist has just published The Secret Le of the Otter: a book filled with astonishingly intimate images of the creatures at rest, at play and at war. Getting close enough to capture them fighting, gambolling and even mating is incredibly rare.Of Howardrsquos three wildle photography books, this is the one hersquos proudest of because it was the hardest to produce. ldquoOtters are elusive in the extreme, he says. ldquoTheir incredible shyness combined with hyper-aware senses and natural camouflage has made them successful survivors.:Line of Duty proves appointment TV is not deadOtters have inhabited Scotlandrsquos lochs, shores and rivers for at least , years, yet their nocturnal habits and wary natures have made them shadowy presences, often accorded magical qualities in myths and legends. At one time, people debated whether they were fish, canines or amphibians: early clerics are said to have argued over whether or not their flesh could be eaten during Lent.And although they were hunted for sport and for their pelts until the practice was banned in , these enigmatic creatures seem always to have been regarded with affection. They were once trained to catch fish or turn fireside spits for their human masters, and there are records of them being tamed like puppies during the th century.Andy Howard treats them with respect rather than amiability and having spent a day on the hills watching him photograph mountain hares, Irsquom struck by his contrasting approach to the two mammals.With hares, he maintains a constant, low chatter as he looks them in the eye and clicks the shutter, sometimes addressing them fondly by name. ldquoWhen photographing hares, you want them to see you, hear you and be aware of you, he says now. ldquoWith otters, you donrsquot want them to know you are there at all.There are no pet names in his new book, in which he describes his relationship with the animals as one of ldquokinship. What does he mean by that  ldquoThe thing I like about spending time with otters is that I have to be as secretive as they are, in a way. I have to be furtive and become part of their environment to succeed with them. So I find myself quite often behaving like an otter.:Northern Ireland at : Growing up in a land of dreams and terrorHe prefers to work on stormy days, when ldquothe wind masks the sound of my shutter, and hersquos not afraid to immerse himself in brine in order to catch the ldquosuper-low, otterrsquos-eye perspective that brings the viewer right into the animalrsquos watery world.Rapt in concentration while photographing a mother and her cubs, he once lost his footing and tumbled backwards off the rocks and into the sea. ldquoI remember looking upwards to see green bubbles racing to the surface, only just managing to struggle ashore.His subjects ndash whose likenesses were obliterated by the salt water ndash seemed unperturbed by the dripping cameraman flailing around trying to retrieve his equipment. That day, Howard appears to have completed his transmogrication into a sea creature.An otter once got close enough to snf his boots another dosed happily in his presence after hersquod spent five or six days quietly observing it while camouflaged among seaweed. ldquoIt had grown to take me as a part of the landscape and would walk past quite nonchalantly within a couple of metres then roll about or curl up and sleep. I actually started talking to it ndash just whispering to see its reaction. It seemed to accept the fact that I was gently talking to it.When I catch up with Andy Howard, Covid- restrictions mean I canrsquot join him in his preferred, Hebridean snapping ground. So this morning, keen to observe an otter in the flesh, I preceded our phone interview with a mini-safari along Glasgowrsquos White Cart.:Celebrating Archie Brennan, innovator, pop artist, adventurer and former Mr ScotlandPrevious generations of Glaswegians would have been unlikely to see otters on rivers flanked by factories, mills and engineering works. Otters prefer clean waters and during the s, over-use of pesticides combined with industrial pollution and other factors drove them out of many British waterways. Some died as a result of toxins in their food chain and their numbers plummeted by %.Since the s, however, the ban on agricultural pesticides such as DDT, along with de-industrialisation and legal protections against culling, have led to a healthy resurgence and there have been several recent sightings along the now decontaminated White Cart.Unfortunately, however, my morning wildle-spotting expedition gleaned nothing but some ducks and an old fox scratching its fleas. Where did I go wrong  ldquoYou didnrsquot go wrong at all, Howard reassures me. ldquoItrsquos the luck of the draw. Otters have a great ability to blend in with their surroundings, whether it be the bank of a river in Glasgow, a peat hag in Shetland or some seaweed on the island of Mull.The fact they often float with just their eyes and nose above water makes them virtually invisible. ldquoWhen they are in the water, especially a river, they almost become liquid themselves, says Howard. ldquoAnd the way they move makes them very dficult to spot unless you have a really well-trained eye.Because they hunt mostly at night, their black, tarry droppingsalong with half-eaten fish, crabs or lobster, are often the only signs of their presence and ldquothe best opportunity to see them is when theyrsquove actually caught something and theyrsquore sitting on a rock or on the foot of a bridge, eating their dinner.Another trick, says the otter-whisperer, is to listen. Having determined that an environment is ldquoottery, hersquoll sometimes drive around with the windows open. ldquoI often hear otter cubs before I actually see them, he explains. ldquoTheyrsquore quite vocal.:Teddy Jamieson: Do we really need a Festival of Brexit Can he describe the noise they make  ldquoIrsquom not good at impressions, he laughs, ldquobut itrsquos a very high-pitched whistle thatrsquos designed to cut through the air. The natural sounds surrounding otters are quite low-frequency ndash waves crashing, trees rustling. A cubrsquos high-frequency whistle pierces through all the other sounds, giving the bitch otter a chance to catch up with it or find itthe family becomes separated. They are very good at communicating with each other.Late one evening, Howard was startled by a pitul screeching and followed the sound to discover a distressed mother otter whose cubs were being summarily killed in front of her by a male. Otters are territorial with males guarding a range of up to km. And while females often live together in family groups, dog-otters are solitary, communing with others only to mate.On this occasion, a marauding male had apparently taken over anotherrsquos territory and was ensuring the survival of his own genes. In his book, Howard explains that ldquobeyond her terrible trauma, the bitchrsquos body would respond by ing rapidly into heat, and the dog would be close at hand to impregnate her.Howard got no pictures that day ndash partly because the light was poor but also because of the emotional impact on him. ldquoIrsquod read about it happening but never thought Irsquod be in a position to witness it, he says now. ldquoAnd in a way I felt privileged to have seen such a raw, brutal element of the le of the otter. People that have studied otters for their le and work have never seen that happen.ldquoNature is quite cruel at times, he adds. ldquoItrsquos all part of the process ndash and yes, it was an upsetting thing to witness.Hadnrsquot he been tempted to intervene  ldquoI didnrsquot really know what was going on until it was too late, he says, though in any case, approaching a frenzied otter could be dangerous. For all their cute faces and ldquohumanlike qualities, these are wild animals with strong jaws and teeth designed to crunch through shell and bone. Howard once met the late TV naturalist Terry Nutkins, who in boyhood had lost two fingers to one of Gavin Maxwellrsquos otters while working as his assistant in the western Highlands.Maxwell did much to popularise the image of the otter as a cuddlesome, furry friend. In his bestselling  book, Ring of Bright Water, he described sharing his home, his bath and even his bed with the creatures. ldquoIrsquom not sure that sits comfortably with me, says Howard. ldquoMuch as I appreciate Gavin Maxwellrsquos writing, Irsquom not an advocate of people removing animals from the wild and keeping them as pets.In fact, the photographer takes the opposite approach, interfering as little as possible with the animalsrsquo natural habitat and presenting readers with a privileged insight into a world in which the human presence has ostensibly been obliterated.Most of the Secret Le images were captured around sea lochs and he often visits a location several times before taking any pictures. ldquoThat way you get to know the animalsrsquo inidual characteristics:they fish at low tide, high tide, where they like to sleep. It means I can be in position, waiting for the otter to come in.Howard conducts wildle photography tours and his top tip for clients is to be patient. ldquoThe more time you invest, the bigger the reward. With otters especially, the moment often comes towards the end of the time you allocate to spend with them. If I just bide my time, it should reward me in the long term and usually that does happen. Otter karma is something I teach my clients: donrsquot push itit doesnrsquot happen itrsquos not meant to be. If it is supposed to happen it will happen and therersquos always another day.And when the stars align, clients have sometimes been moved to tears. ldquoItrsquos such an emotional thing, to have a close encounter with an otter, says Howard. ldquoThatrsquos what drives me ndash itrsquos like a drug. Delving into the secret le of an otter is almost voyeuristic. So highly tuned are the animalrsquos senses that managing to get close enough to take nice pictures without it having any sense of being watched, gives you an adrenaline rush. Therersquos no doubt that my clients and I get high on it. Then you crave your next fix.The Secret Le of the Otter is not intended as a scientic text but a ldquocelebration of the species. Howardrsquos first book may well have been influential in bringing about a parliamentary ban on the mass culling of mountain hares and he hopes this one will have a similar legacy in terms of awareness-raising, so that people will ldquofall in love with the animals ndash thereby helping to ensure they are respected and protected.Of all the beautul images in his book, Howardrsquos favourite features a pair of white-tailed eagles, swooping down on an otter that had just landed its catch. ldquoTo get one eagle with an otter is fairly unusual to get two is pretty special.Inevitably for the photographer, as for the fish-hungry otter, there is always the one that got away. He dearly wanted to include an image of an otter eating a lobster and one evening, he watched through binoculars as one surfaced,  metres offshore, with a pair of distinctive red antennae hanging from its mouth.Howard made for the otterrsquos most likely landing ground and switched on his camera, only to find that the battery was dead. ldquoSo I had to sit and watch that otter eat that lobster ndash one of my dream images. It was lovely to watch but I could have almost cried.ldquoWhether it will happen again for me I donrsquot know. Crsquoest la vie, though. You canrsquot stress out or get angryyou miss a shot. You just have to hope itrsquoll come round again or something similar will come along.ldquoAnd inevitably, it does, he says, demonstrating his carefully honed otter karma.The Secret Le of the Otter by Andy Howard is published by Sandstone Press, pound.FAMOUS OTTER STORIESCuthbert and the OttersOtters are referred to as ldquowater dogs in Celtic folklore, and generally portrayed as helpful, friendly creatures, providing fish or firewood to people in need and even warming their feet, as in the story of St Cuthbert ndash patron saint of otters. A Celtic monk living at Lindisfarne during the seventh-century, Cuthbert was reputedly fond of taking nocturnal walks along the seashore. One night, a curious colleague secretly watched as he waded into the sea right up to his neck and began singing psalms. As dawn broke, he ed to shore, whereupon two otters came up and warmed his cold wet feet with their fur. Cuthbert blessed them, and they ed to their holts.Ring of Bright WaterGavin Maxwellrsquos celebrated  memoir describes his le in a remote cottage at ldquoCamusfearna , and the two imported otters he kept there as pets. He sourced his favourite ndash Mij ndash in Iraq and brought him to the UK during an eventful plane journey that saw the creature chewing its way out of its box and running rampage around the cabin. Maxwell fed the animal on bucketloads of collected eels, walked it through the streets in a custom-made harness and allowed it free rein of his London and Scottish homes where it frequently pierced visitorsrsquo ears with its teeth. The story was partially fictionalised in a  film adaptation and for a generation of children, the scene involving Mijrsquos brutal dispatch, at the end of a road-diggerrsquos shovel, was a tearjerker on a par with the shooting of Bambirsquos mother.Tarka the OtterThis  novel by Henry Williamson recounts the le story of an otter cub that becomes separated from its mother and wanders the North Devon countryside alone, until it eventually fathers a family of cubs of its own, before being killed by the local otter hunt.

I stopped at a shop in Pirnmill and told the shop assistant: \"It is  years since I last was here.rsquorsquo She took the news calmly.I, in contrast, spent much of the trip catching flimsy, colourful fibres that swirled into the recesses of my napper on the capricious winds of times past.The summer of  may just be remembered universally for more than the MacDonald family holiday in Pirnmill, however dficult that is to believe.But on myto Arran as an old man, I found my memories were oddly vivid and that the signicance of that particular holiday in the sixties has endured. HUGH: Nuisance calls drive me madThere are the obvious facets. It was the first holiday that I realised we had a bit of money. Not oodles. But a bit.Pater had moved some years before, resisting the allure of being an electrician in Dalmarnock sewage works to being an early and unrecognised source for Mad Men. This owed something to his undoubted eccentricity, but is mostly attributable to his rising success as an advertising executive.We stayed in Pirnmill for most of the school holidays, with dad travelling down on weekends. With the instinct of a clan unused to money, we knew this cost money.It was also the last time the family spent a holiday together. It seems odd but we were heading off in dferent directions even then. With a spell at seminary and then a career in journalism, I never really lived at home again and never joined the rest on holiday, at least en masse.My reminiscence also recovered something slightly odd but utterly irrefutable. The boy of  was not much dferent from the dodderer of . In Pirnmill of , I was plagued by puberty, racked by doubt, immersed in self-talk, and thrummed to a gentle, constant pulse of anxiety. At , it was largely the same, including the battle with puberty.There was, though, an acceptance of these traits that did not quite exist in the past. HUGH: Kelvingrove memoriesThere was, too, a recognition that what consumed me then, sustains me now.Arran then was constantly sunny, or so it seemed. The MacDonald clan revelled in swimming, walking, cycling and fishing. It was like an Enid Blyton novel without the odd events at Smugglersrsquo Cove and stripped of lashings of ginger beer and English exceptionalism.At its core for me were the transistor radio and the book. The small radio was stashed under a pillow and was a faithful companion late into the night and early into the morning. It crackled, misfired and occasionally caught a radio station across the spectrum. My love of music and radio was kindled in these sessions. It lives on, allowing me to drt through restless nights.It was the arrival of the books, though, that fully stirred communal emotion. The MacDonald family consumed books the way the Kardashians use up spouses.A new supplywas delivered by my father each week. We fell on them with the energy of wolves after a six-week fast. We then passed them around in a sort of literary game of speed dating.It was the way I was introduced to F Scott Fitzgerald. The Great Gatsby, presumably brought for mum, was guided into my hands. It was read then. It is read now.I am not a committed re-reader. I believe there are too many great books still to be read and so shirk from revisiting a past delight.:Rosemary Goring: Its not just the squirrels who are coming out of hibernation, we are tooThere are exceptions. Gatsby is one. It is rewarding and infuriating. It offers constant gts on every visit. It retains its intrigue. Most of all, it reminds me of why I read.Of course, there is the pleasure of being immersed in good prose, there is the delight of a visit to another place, there is the comfort of being lost in another world.I realise now that it also takes me back to the boy. It shows me that many things change in the world but beliefs, passions and pleasures can survive the depredations of time. Of course, they are refined or adapted to present circumstances but what carried me then somehow bears me now.This owes something to the physical aspect of a book but more to its spiritual power. It can remind us of a family that has suffered but routine, natural but grievous loss but carries cascades of love that accompany that bond and need no physical proximity to survive.It is why snatches of prose, snippets of music or even a visit to the wee shop at Pirnmill have such power. They remind us of who we each were but also reveal who we are now. Certainly, there has been change. But beneath the bruises and the scars inflicted by time and wilful self, this soul can look back at the child and say: ldquoI recognise you.In the routine excitement a ferry trip prompts in me, I may glimpse him today.

And how. The winning Tory candidate in Thursday nightrsquos by-election gained twice as many votes as the sitting Labour MP.To portray Hartlepool as belonging to Labourrsquos heartlands doesnrsquot really tell the story: this town is at the heart of the heartlands. It takes some amount of neglect and entitlement to lose it to the Tories by such a margin.If the swing from red to blue were to be repeated in the  UK election, another  Labour seats, once considered to be their natural terrain, would also fall to the Tories. The Labour Party, north and south of the border, can now be considered destitute: last orders have been called and they have no home to call their own.When I visited this town in  after it had voted - in favour of Brexit scores of Labour voters told me the same story: they had waited in vain for more than two decades for someone, anyone, to heed their cries for help.: What will SNP win mean for working class In  Hartlepool was listed in the top % of Englandrsquos most deprived areas in a survey that measured income, health, education and crime. They were resentful at being labelled racist by the elites in their own party for daring to back Brexit.If Labour strategists had cared enough to listen theyrsquod know why. After tens of thousands of jobs disappeared in fishing and car manufacturing, there was no industrial strategy to help this area recover. The same story was unfolding up and down the Humber Estuary: a wholesale surrender to Europe on fishing rights was followed by an influx of cheap foreign labour undercutting local wage agreements. These stemmed from EU pay regulations which encouraged exploitation of eastern European workers. To oppose this doesnrsquot make you racist.Jeremy Corbyn understood why, though, and this underpinned his long-held disdain for the EU corporate club. On Friday morning, as the full extent of Labourrsquos Hartlepool capitulation became apparent, several of Sir Keirrsquos company men were wheeled out to hang it on his predecessor.Anas SarwarldquoWhat chance did we have, they whined, citing Labourrsquos collapse in , but this was a lame excuse. In these local elections Boris Johnson has surfed the waves of euphoria flowing from the successful vaccination roll-out and the end of lockdown. In , working-class communities, swept up by Brexit and resentful of the Labourrsquos elitesrsquo EU obsession began to rebel. Hartlepool confirmed that Labourrsquos Red Wall is now rubble.In Scotland, the collapse of UK Labour is a watershed moment for the partyrsquos leader, Anas Sarwar. In England, the process of surrendering Labour fortresses to the Tories was begun by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. As they were mesmerised by neo-liberalism and corporatism they came to regard communities like Hartlepool and Bolsover as their politically-incorrect uncle Harry: we canrsquot disown them but do we really have to talk to them.Toryism of the most insidious stamp is now embedded in every corner of England and Labour have made gts of their former territories. The Labour elites who betrayed Corbyn no longer speak the same language as the working-class communities they once purported to represent. Itrsquos a language the Tories have now learned.: Theof Project FearEngland is now entirely under the control of an Etonian kleptocracy who have commandeered patriotism, royalty and gunboats to hoodwink working-class communities that they share their values. These poor people, owing to Labourrsquos neglect of them, will learn the harsh truth when the decade of austerity begins and they find themselves once more on the receiving end.Never has England seemed so distant in its culture, instincts and values. That a dissolute and feckless aristocrat, distrusted by his own party, and for whom poundk-a-year and free accommodation is not enough can triumph in Hartlepool tells its own story.Mr Sarwar now has a choice to make which will define his leadership. Does he continue to pledge allegiance to a polity now under the eternal dominion of this class  If he chooses to maintain his glib sufferance of such a state then he will make Labour an utter irrelevance in Scotland. If he chooses to lend his weight to a second independence referendum he brings his party back into the game with a chance of forming the first government of an independent Scotland.English Labourrsquos failure to heed the messages coming from their former strongholds mirrors the experience of the party in Scotland. They had a sense of entitlement that their fortresses in Glasgow, Dundee, Inverclyde and North Lanarkshire would always come through. As their grandees were seduced by the leather and lace of the Westminster bordello they simply abandoned these communities. Rather than stay and fight for them Jack McConnell, George Foulkes, George Robertson and Alistair Darling chose ermine robes and the Palace of Westminsterrsquos comforting teat.Mr Sarwar doesnrsquot need me to tell him that many of his partyrsquos former supporters voted for the SNP on Thursday against all the instincts and traditions of their families. Nicola Sturgeon has expertly deployed a hard Brexit and the gangsterism of Downing Street to keep them. Her promises of seeking a second referendum are now like confetti and last about as long. Scotlandrsquos First Minister merely has to represent something dferent from the corrupt regime that Mr Sarwarrsquos ill-judged Unionism reinforces she doesnrsquot actually have to make dferent happen.If Mr Sarwar maintains his unflinching support for a state destined to be controlled by the hard right for a generation then Labour is finished up here too. In this hersquoll betray those working-class communities who have been locked out of the Holyrood vanity project and its platinum-card lounges since the beginning of devolution.He talks about a Covid recovery parliament, but Hartlepool means that this concept is already out-dated.

When a lot is at stake, a lot of people turn out.Results still to come, of course. But let us work for now on the very reasonable assumption that Nicola Sturgeon will be ing to work on Monday as the First Minister of Scotland. What will immediately confront her Self-evidently, the Covid crisis ndash and its concomitant economic challenges. However, along with that, she will have to form a new Cabinet. One third of the previous team stood down at the election.Read more from Brian Taylor: Parties united by one thing: a desire for voters to just move onSo Ms Sturgeon will have to govern in future without the sagacious counsel of Aileen Campbell, Roseanna Cunningham, Jeane Freeman and Michael Russell.Ms Sturgeon may also take the opportunity to reshape her Cabinetrsquos structure and responsibilities, while preserving gender balance.That Cabinet exodus is matched in the lower Ministerial ranks and on the back benches. In addition, elections tend to generate involuntary departures. Democracy would notwithout such Parliamentary churn, however hard it is for iniduals.All the newbies ndash on all sides of the chamber ndash will need to learn, and quickly: not least because the anxious citizens of Scotland want speedy action in the continuing contest with coronavirus. When will we be safe  Where can we go on holiday Those decisions are urgent. Ms Sturgeon previously promised that there would be a further liberalisation on May , with Scotland generally ing to Level  constraints. If we all obey the rules.As for international travel, the UK Government has now set out its thinking. The Scottish Government has tended to favour a more cautious approach. Again, urgently, Ms Sturgeon will seek to revive a four-nation UK deal.Why four nation  Because it is simpler to explain and administer, it deters Scots from heading south of the border to get round Scottish rules: and, bluntly, it provides additional protection for the FM against complaints from Scots who might be super-angryEngland gets a more open deal.In tandem with action on the virus, Ms Sturgeon willto Ministerial briefing boxes brimming with information about the economy. Here is a hint: the data will not be universally positive.No doubt her attention will be drawn to a report from the Bank of England forecasting that the UK economy will enjoy record economic growth in , perhaps around . per cent. That is founded on expectations of higher confidence among consumers, happy with the vaccine numbers.However, Nicola Sturgeon will need no reminding that this possible uplt follows a calamitous slump last year, when the economy shrank by nearly ten per cent the most precipitous drop in three centuries.She knows too that the voters will expect delivery of the spending promises made in her manesto: more money for health, education, housing and social care. All within a balanced budget, constrained still further by a pledge to freeze Scottish income tax rates and bands.That promise, mirrored by other parties, was designed to reassure fretful voters. Starting today, it too has to be delivered.Then there is the related issue of securing Parliamentary support for budget proposals. That depends on the final Holyrood numbers.If she gains an overall majority, then she has only to sustain discipline in her own ranks. However,she is dependent once more upon the Greens for budgetary support, there could be some trouble ahead.The Greens tend to push for radical fiscal change for example, arguing during the campaign that Scotland should seek ways to tax wealth as well as income.They will also press Nicola Sturgeon to support swter curbs on the extraction of North Sea oil. Ministers back a move away from fossil fuels but worry about the immediate impact on jobs, arguing for a justtransition.If it comes to it, they may have to remind the Greens that big parties have rights too.Then the fundamental contest. Independence. Boris Johnson is expected to reach out to Scotland with measures designed to promote the Union and stress UK clout. One or two Tories mutter privately that such an initiative might have been handy before the election, not after.The Prime Minister will also face pressure to spell out whether he would consent to indyref. But not perhaps immediately. Ms Sturgeon herself is in no particular hurry.She knows that anxious voters will expect a laser focus on recovering from coronavirus.More, the FM fully understands that the independence offer in Scotland has always been predicated upon confidence.

They might, at the very least, prefer to delay the decision.Finally, from the political to the personal. Nicola Sturgeon must be simply exhausted. A bizarre yet enervating election on top of endless endeavours to counter coronavirus and sustain the economy.All that plus Alex Salmond, seemingly at her shoulder for months, leading up to his unwanted offer of Holyrood help in pursuit of independence.For Nicola Sturgeon, then, time for rest and recuperation.

It is a scenario that will be familiar to many Scottish voters, for this has been the  Days Later election for these pandemic times.Anything that involved coming within two metres of a stranger was out of the question . So cheerio doorstep debating, rallies, walkabouts, all the usual fun and games, and hello masks and Zoom.The battle began in routine fashion with the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament. Some MSPs were not seeking re-election, among them Ruth Davidson, who was leaving to spend more time with her ermine.For everyone  it was off to the constituency or region to prepare for government. Or,you were a Scottish Labour candidate, to prepare your excuses. With Anas Sarwar in charge there was a certain spring in the partyrsquos step, with the new leader even joining in with an outdoors exercise class dancing to Uptown Funk. Yes sir, he can boogie.Willie Rennie continued his quest to stage the most ridiculous photo op ever, with shots of the LibDem leader at a penguin parade, in a giant deckchair, and boxing. Not wishing to be left out, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross continued his partyrsquos tradition of clambering on to the nearest military vehicle, in his case an armoured personnel carrier. And he wasnrsquot even campaigning in Castlemilk.Mr Ross received a lot of help from his predecessor, Ms Davidson, who even fronted the party political broadcast. Her omnipresence contrasted with the complete absence of Boris Johnson. Having said that wild horses wouldnrsquot keep him away, the Prime Minister preferred to stay in London and dodge questions about gold wallpaper rather than take his chances with rebellious Scots .Try as the parties did to generate excitement, the campaign was proving as empty and devoid of interest as Celticrsquos trophy cabinet. Then it happened. Cue movie trailer voice guy: ldquoThe sky darkened. Birds ceased singing. Jaws dropped. HE was back. And this time HE had brought a whole new party with him. After the initial shock of Alex Salmondrsquos , observers turned to more serious matters, like how to pronounce the Alba Partyrsquos name. Some said ldquoAlapa others ldquoWallopers. Mr Salmond came bearing the promise of a ldquosupermajority of independence-supporting MSPs who would make Johnson an offer he could not refuse.The media was delighted to see theof Mr Salmond, and reporters were soon asking SNP leader Nicola Sturgeonshe would work with her predecessor. Ms Sturgeon gave the impression she did not wish to be on the same continent as her old boss, never mind in coalition with him.The SNP leader conducted a lot of her campaign from her by-now-famous conservatory. FDR had his fireside chats, Nicola has natters in the greenhouse. Consensus had it that the election was in the bag for her. It only remained to be seenshe would win a majority, and which party would take second place to the SNP, the Conservatives or Labour.The TV debates gave voters a chance to see the party leaders in action. Not all the leaders, however. BBC Scotland and STV limited participation to the five largest parties in the Scottish Parliament, which meant no podium for Mr Salmond or George Galloway, the leader of the All for Unityparty.Mr Galloway tried to whip up interest in a mano a mano with the Alba leader, moderated by Andrew Neil. Viewers might have been interested had David Attenborough not featured extensive scenes of walruses fighting in his last televisual masterpiece.So five went off to debate, with Sarah Smith and Glenn Campbell holding the jaikets for the BBC, and Colin Mackay doing the same for STV. Channel rsquos Krishnan Guru-Murthy came all the way from London town to show us he was as familiar with Scottish politics as Donald Trump was with third-wave feminism.The televised debates were missing a live audience in the studio, and turned out to be horribly dull in consequence. Scottish Greens co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater ided the debate work between them, though Steve Arnott-dress-a-like Harvie hogged more of the limelight.Anas Sarwar adopted a ldquoWhy canrsquot we be friends approach to the debates, albeit the offer clearly did not extend to the Conservatives, who were the focus of everyonersquos attacks. Douglas Ross seemed spectacularly cross in most of the encounters, while Ms Sturgeon tried hard not to look humongously smug or bored.Election day arrived, and with it the chance to exercise that age-old right to take a photie of the dug at a polling place and post it on Twitter.The one million Scots who had registered to vote by post had already done their bit, quietly and without fuss, in keeping with the mood. In one final insult from the heavens, the counts were not starting till the morning after, so voters were denied the thrill of spending the night with Kirsty Wark and Bernard Ponsonby.It had been that kind of election, that kind of year. May we never see its likes again."},{"url":null,"title":"mike-settle-sir-keir-starmer-now-faces-major-rethink-reset","story":"By contrast, Boris Johnson on his victory visit to Hartlepool was in high spirits, joking as he met a ft inflatable version of himself and, like fellow national incumbents Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland and Mark Drakeford in Wales, enjoying the electoral afterglow of a vaccine bounce.Declaring what mattered was delivery on the ground, the Prime Minister insisted he had dedicated his government to the ldquomassive project of ldquouniting and levelling up the country.ldquoNumber one is continuing the vaccine rollout, declared Mr Johnson, ldquomaking sure we go from jab to jab, to jab to jobs, jobs, jobs.Despite all the political bruises he has suffered in the past weeks, and will doubtless suffer again in the coming ones, voters south of the border sought, for now, to support the Conservativesrsquo positive message of jabs and jobs.Amid the blight of the pandemic, it was a triumph of hope over despair and not only resulted in the Toriesrsquo astonishing win in Hartlepool, which elected its first Conservative MP for  years, but a landslide victory for their candidate Ben Houchen, who was ed as mayor for Tees Valley, yet another former Labour heartland.While there were a few red shoots in England, the overall theme was one of Tory gains and consolidation from Essex to Northumberland.As the Labour losses piled up it did not take long for the recriminations to set in.Not surprisingly, Jeremy Corbyn led the charge, suggesting his successor had been ldquooffering nothing only insipid support to the Tory Government while John McDonnell, the former Shadow Chancellor, accused his party leader of sending candidates into battle ldquoalmost naked without a full policy programme.:Angela Rayner sacked as Labour party chairmanThe union barons also piled into Sir Keir with alacrity. Unitersquos Len McCluskey complained: ldquoPeople donrsquot know what his vision is. People donrsquot know what Labour stand for anymore.Meanwhile from the partyrsquos centre, the wily Sultan of Spin popped up to insist the defeat in his former manor of Hartlepool was down to the long shadows of Covid and Corbyn.Lord Mandelson, who admitted to ldquomild fury at the by-election defeat, declared: ldquoWe have not won a general election in  years, and pointedly noted: ldquoWe have lost the last four with  a catastrophe. The last  general elections read: lose, lose, lose, lose, Blair, Blair, Blair, lose, lose, lose, lose.Brexit doubtless had an effect, particularly in Hartlepool, where more than % of voters had opted for Leave. It is clear the tranche of voters, who Nigel Faragersquos Brexit Party won over, chose to support the Tories rather than Labour.But Brexit was not the only reason for the Conservativesrsquo wins. Time and again as the electoral dust settled, voters in northern England insisted they had for years been taken for granted by Labour. Sound familiar Northerners insisted Labour politicians had not listened to their concerns while the Tories went beyond the old Left-Right ide and put community investment at the forefront of their campaign.The real fear for Sir Keir and his strategists in Labour HQ must be that what happened to the party in Scotland over two decades is now happening in northern England. Those areas, once described as heartlands from the industrial past, have lost heart with Labour.:Anas Sarwar: Labour to form credible alternative to SNPOne Opposition frontbencher admitted the by-election result had sparked ldquofull-on panic among Labour MPs, fearful their seats could be at risk at the next general election.Wales was a dferent story. Mr Drakeford defied the pollsters and led Welsh Labour to gain  seats, equalling its best ever result, and ensuring its -year unbroken run in power will continue. The dferent outcome for Labour in Wales simply underlined how this has become a disunited kingdom with voters across three nations taking dferent approaches to the choices before them.Of course, Conservative consolidation south of the border will only play into the Nationalist narrative north of it that Scotland and England are increasingly drting apart politically and there is only one solution to resolve this.It is intriguing how, in England at least, while Labour has increasingly become a metropolitan party, attractive to Remainer students and well-to-do English middle classes but lost touch with northern England working class communities, the Tories have begun to appeal to poorer ldquoRed Wall towns, many of which backed Brexit.Birmingham MP Khalid Mahmood, a Shadow Defence Minister but perhaps not for long, derided the ldquoLondon-based bourgeoisie, backed by ldquobrigades of woke social media warriors, that had ldquoeffectively captured the party. Sir Keir, London-born and Surrey-raised, is MP for Holborn and St Pancras.Centre Right Labour peer Lord Adonis branded him a ldquotransitional figure and claimed: ldquoLabourrsquos problem is it has had weak or terrible leaders since Tony Blair stood down  years ago and until it gets an electable leader, it will keep losing elections.The name of northerner Andy Burnham, the Manchester mayor, is already being whispered as a future leader.Sir Keir now faces a major rethink and reset, that will involve a frontline reshuffle, an overhaul of policy and a drive to reunite hisparty.Labour needs fundamentally to find and set out a clear, bold mission statement for Britain in the st century. We could see some familiar faces, big hitters like Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn,to the frontbench.The mountain Labour has to climb to win power in, perhaps, just two yearsrsquo time, is of Everest proportions so much so that a pre-election pact with the Liberal Democrats looks increasingly possible as the only means to stop a fourth consecutive Tory term. Last month, Ed Davey referred to the pressing need for a ldquoprogressive anti-Tory alternative.As Sir Keir and his colleagues now struggle through Labourrsquos dark night of the soul, they can only hope these elections are the darkest period before the new dawn.

But it is only now, as wersquove seen it happen, that the potential crisis has become actual.The UK Government insists there is no case for another referendum on independence because we had one in . Boris Johnson has even suggested that the gap for Indyref should be the same as between the first and second referendums on Europe:  years. But this has been a holding position and is no longer sustainable. Ciaran Martin, the former UK Cabinet Office civil servant who oversaw the  referendum, says this rejectionism is an offence against democracy itself. If the independence parties win another majority, he said last month, ldquothere is no legitimate justication on which to resist a referendum.:Johnson invites Sturgeon to Team UK four nations summit after election victoryIt is true there were other issues in this election campaign besides the referendum: education and the pandemic for starters. But no-one in Scotland could have been in any doubt about what they were voting for on Thursday. When they placed their crosses on the SNP and the Greens, they were voting emphatically for Indyref. Scottish voters must themselves now take responsibility for their actions. The very size of the turnout has upped the constitutional ante.The Scottish Tory leader, Douglas Ross, claimed that Nicola Sturgeon was planning an illegal ldquowildcat referendum. That is untrue. She has always said that the only referendum she would agree to is a constitutional, legally-binding one authorised by Westminster under a Section  Order. This is for a very good reason. Only such a referendum would be regarded as legitimate by other countries ndash especially the European Union, which the SNP is eager to rejoin. Only a legally-binding referendum would put the result, as she put it, ldquobeyond doubt or challenge in the eyes of the world.Which doesnrsquot mean she will simply accept the Westminster veto. Ms Sturgeon made clear in the Channel  leadersrsquo debate that she intends to go to court herself. She will ask the Scottish Parliament to pass a referendum bill and then defy Boris Johnson to reject it. Assuming he does, the Scottish Government will then challenge this ruling in the courts. Irsquom not entirely sure this will succeed, and Irsquom not entirely sure she thinks it will either. The Supreme Court would ultimately rule on the matter, and it seems unlikely that the United Kingdomrsquos highest court would actively support the dissolution of the United Kingdom.But that isnrsquot really the point. Court action would be constitutional theatre designed to increase the moral pressure on Boris Johnson to offer a plausible referendum timetable. There was speculation last month that he might actually do this. Ministers had, it was reported, considered holding a snap referendum to catch the SNP unawares.Support for the SNP may remain stratospheric, but support for independence has been waning somewhat. Nicola Sturgeon has had dficulty explaining the new border and currency issues that arise with independence post-Brexit. So why not put the question now, while the SNP is on the back foot I donrsquot think therersquos much risk of this happening. Boris Johnson may have won the Brexit vote, but he is very wary indeed of referendums. He saw what happened to his predecessor, David Cameron, who thought the  referendum would be a walk-over for Remain. The  referendum was a near-death experience for the British state. Referendums are highly unpredictable, and rarely just about the narrow question on the ballot paper.Indeed, a second Scottish independence referendum could easily turn into a referendum on Boris Johnson himself ndash a figure who is profoundly unpopular in Scotland. The Scottish Conservatives barred him from appearing in the election campaign, even though the PM had said that ldquowild horses couldnrsquot keep him away.:Iain Macwhirter: It was an SNP landslide, but dont expect an early IndyrefWe have heard much about the Governmentrsquos plans for massive investment in Scotland on roads and rail links, even a bridge or tunnel to Northern Ireland. But such pork-barrel initiatives are unlikely to answer the fundamental question. If the UK Government is to repeatedly reject the clearly expressed will of the Scottish people to hold a referendum, how can it reasonably claim to be a democracy  Continuing to reject it would transform the Union from being a partnership of nations into a coercive union, based on legal force.Piecemeal reform, such as the Smith Commission in  that tinkered with tax powers, and gave a mendacious assurance that the Sewel Convention was inviolable, will not do. There has to be a recognition in Westminster that Scotland is now in charge of its own destiny. I believe there are ways to achieve this and retain the only union worth saving: one that is a free and equal partnership of nations.The devolution era is over. Power devolved is power retained, and events since Brexit have confirmed the wisdom of that dictum. The federal boat, however, has also sailed. England would never agree to the upheaval involved in creating the constitutional paraphernalia of federalism: regional parliaments, a federal executive, a president of the UK. They are quite happy with the Parliament theyrsquove got. What might be possible is a form of asymmetrical federalism that the late Labour First Minister, Donald Dewar, used to call ldquoindependence in the UK and the SNP called ldquofiscal autonomy.All tax and spending powers could be devolved to Scotland, with Holyrood sending back a percept, a kind of fee, for common services like defence and currency. This would end the Barnett Formula and give full economic responsibility to Holyrood, but retain the social and cultural links with the rest of the UK. It would largely fulfil what was envisaged by the SNPrsquos  Independence White Paper: a ldquonew UK with a common currency, borderless trade with England, and the retention of UK institutions like the Crown and BBC.This would be a radical departure, however, not dissimilar to the way countries like New Zealand and Canada acquired quasi-independence in the s in the sterling area. The evidence is pretty clear that England, which following Hartlepool is becoming more Tory and more nationalist, would not object. It would mean Scotland taking charge of the money issue and ending what has been called Scotlandrsquos ldquodependency culture.For their part, Scottish nationalists are beginning to realise that independence is no walk in the park now that Britain is out of the EU. No-one wants a hard border with England, but one is now inevitable.Independence in the UK would create a new Union held together not by legal constraint, but by consent. I have no idea whether Boris Johnson has the will or the imagination to seize this opportunity. I rather doubt it. But even he must realise that doing nothing is no longer an option.

All sites are now luxury homes and apartment complexes.Public interest lsquoignoredrsquoARCHITECT Malcolm Fraser said The Ferretrsquos investigation had revealed ldquoan underlying transfer from the public to the private realm of good, well-located sites and sturdy, well-crafted buildings, to be replaced by shoddy newbuilds.He added: ldquoMeanwhile, the old sites,in leafy areas, are snapped up as glam apartments, sometimes by offshore and Far East absentee investors hellip or,less-leafy, left to moulder until maximum public regeneration funding is screwed out of us.Planning Democracy, a Scottish charity which campaigns for an inclusive planning system, said when public land is sold, it ldquochucks away the community power that goes with it.The consequences ldquoare rarely measured or calculated into the equation, the replenishing of depleted coffers being the main aim of the game, said founder Clare Symonds.Ms Symonds argued that ldquoa public interest test must be passed before land is sold off.Shelter Scotland warned that the need for affordable housing ldquohas never been greater. It is calling for the new Scottish Government to build at least , social homes over the next Parliament. ldquoWe were already dealing with a housing emergency before coronavirus hit, said a spokesperson. ldquoAnd,we donrsquot act, things could get a lot worse.The Ferretrsquos investigation had revealed that ldquoland and public assets are being sold off on a massive scale, said Scottish Labourrsquos housing spokesperson, Pauline McNeill. ldquoWe need to invest in growing our public assets, including building more social homes to deal with our housing crisis.Kim Long of the Scottish Greens argued that large developers were ldquotoo often given free rein on public land, threatening public assets and destroying much-needed green spaces.She said: ldquoWhatrsquos worse, communities are still sidelined in decision-making far too often.But a CALA spokesperson said: ldquoThe development of publicly-owned sites typically involves land that has been determined as no longer required or fit for purpose to the seller, following a strategic review by the relevant Government body.ldquoA robust procurement process follows, to ensure the maximisation of funds to the public body. This results in the provision of much-needed new homes, through the transformation of vacant sites, often on brownfield land, and the preservation of historic buildings."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12587561.jpg?type=article-full","title":"paper-round-front-pages-following-scottish-election","story":"Reports of a further push for Scottish independence and a Labour ldquocivil war both madeheadlines in the UKThe Herald led with the SNPs election victory with the front page showing a ided UK with the simple headline of \"landslide\":Johnson invites Sturgeon to Team UK four nations summit after election victoryOur pro-independence sister paper The National led with the SNPs victory and a possible step closer to Indyref  with the headline The People Have SpokenDont miss todays Sunday National! ######## pic dfaYcXDThe Sunday Post focused on the history makers in the Scottish election withKaukab Stewart becoming the first woman of colour to serve as an MSP in the Scottish Parliament after she held the Glasgow Kelvin constituency for the SNP.A first look at tomorrows Sunday Post #tomorrowspaperstoday @hendopolis #scotpapers #buyapaper pic eUIGfqgEPThe Sunday Mail simply led with \"Our future in our hands\" with a picture of a triumphant Nicola Sturgeon.Tomorrows Sunday Mail front page: Our future in our hands #TomorrowsPapersToday #scotpapers pic oyGPxnMQScotland on Sunday ran a headline of \"Sturgeons Indyref vow after her historic victory\"Good morning, Scotland.

Photo: Aidan O#ReillyMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA fth of all EU border checks are now happening in Northern Ireland, the government has said. Senior sources in London have urged the EU to adopt a more pragmatic approach towards the Northern Ireland Protocol and ease the restrictions. It comes ahead of a visit by Lord Frost, Boris Johnson’s adviser on Brexit, to Northern Ireland this week to meet local businesses and the Executive. There have been repeated calls from unionists for the protocol, which was negotiated as part of the UK’s exit deal from the EU, to be replaced. The subject has been raised amid a DUP leadership contest this week. According to the Government, % of all EU checks are between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, a system officials have said is unsustainable and causing businesses and consumers to struggle.Speaking to the Sunday , one adviser said Northern Ireland’s prosperity, described as “the bedrock to peace”, was more dependent on east-west than north-south trade. A senior government source said: “The protocol was always a delicate balance.We made huge compromises, in the best possible spirit, to avoid a hard border and protect the Good Friday Agreement – listening to the genuine concerns raised by Brexit. The protocol does many good things but the balance that it sought to achieve is under risk and the UK’s internal market is being undermined.”The resignation of Arlene Foster as First Minister and DUP leader was blamed for the issues with the way the protocol is operating. The attempt by the EU to impose a hard border on the island of Ireland in the row over vaccine supplies was “hugely destabilising”, the source said. It’s despite attempts to “try and make” the protocol work by “dedramatising and focusing on practicalities”, the source continued. However, the abortive triggering of Article  has been hugely destabilising and the EU does not realise the damage they have caused,” the source said. “It took the moral force out of the protocol in one move and completely undermined Arlene Foster’s attempt to make it work.”A Whitehall source said: “No government can stand by as businesses and consumers struggle.If we cannot find pragmatic solutions, nothing can be left off the table,” they added.

Picture: ReutersEimear McGovernTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA further  new cases of Covid- have been reported in Northern Ireland by the Department of Health on Sunday. No further deaths have been reported.The Department of Health also said ,, vaccines have been administered in total here. It comes as Minister for Agriculture in the Republic Charlie McConalogue has insisted that high Covid- infection rates in the north-west are “not a Border issue”.Health Minister Robin Swann wrote to his Dublin counterpart Stephen Donnelly saying non-essential cross-border travel must be stopped “by enforcementrequired”.In a letter on Wednesday, Mr Swann warned of a “fresh increase of community transmission of Covid-”.He said both governments should do everything possible to prevent non-essential cross-border travel.Ministers in the south have given no indication that the Government intends to prevent non-essential cross-border travel as a result.Speaking on the BBC’s Sunday Politics programme, Mr McConalogue, a Donegal TD, was pressed on whether there should be enforcement measures to prevent cross border travel.Mr McConalogue welcomed what he said was Mr Swann’s willingness to work on a cross-border basis in dealing with the virus.He said: “We have seen, for example in Donegal here, a very close correlation with Derry and Strabane in relation to infections over the last number of months” but he also highlighted the rollout of vaccines on both sides of the border.“I think the key point here is that it’s not a border issue, it’s a regional issue, and we have to work together as we gradually reopen,” he said. The key message as we go forward the key message is continuing to be cautious, he added.He said: “From [Monday] we’re in the situation because of the increasing rollout of vaccination to be able to allow inter-county, non-essential travel.“And that’s because we’ve got into that space and likewise that is the situation in Northern Ireland.“So I think it’s really good that people can now travel between counties for non-essential purposes but in doing that our clear message to everyone is to continue to stay safe and continue to be very aware of the possibility of infectionwe let our guard down.”Dr Tom Black, the chairman of the British Medical Association in Northern Ireland, told the programme he does not believe enforcement is necessary at this point.He said more people have been vaccinated in the Republic than in Northern Ireland and the vaccination programme has worked well to keep transmission of the infection down, especially in older people who are most vulnerable.It’s mostly under s getting the infection and they aren’t as much at risk,” he said. It’s very clear from living in the northwest what’s happening here. Young people are aggregating to have a few drinks in the back garden, they get very cold and go inside and then half of them get the infection from the one person who brought it in. There is still a risk to your granny and long Covid for yourself,” he said.

Sash windows and an elaborately designed porch complete the style.The interior features a grand entrance hall, formal staircase and a dining room with open fireplaces and two drawing rooms. Every room has views of the surrounding gardens.The large kitchen is the heart of the home and this one perfectly marries old and new worlds together.It leads to the comfortable sunroom, looking into the indoor heated swimming pool, complete with sauna, hot tub and changing facilities.The six large refined bedrooms feature traditional decor, and most offer private or en suite bathrooms.Some also have flat-screen TVs, garden views and four poster beds.Other amenities include a -personroom, a guest lounge and a patio leading to mature gardens with the covered barbecue area, a pond and meditation hut.Two separate stables have been converted into two-bedroom apartments.Indeed when it featured on the BBC’s House of the Year programme back in January , presenter Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen described Glenmore Manor as “like your own hotel, with all the facilities just for you”.Estate agent, Martin Anderson, said this stately and elegant country house represents a very rare opportunity on the market.“To put it concisely, it is nothing short of special,” he added. “Set on an extremely large site, the house is surrounded by beautully designed gardens featuring a classical water fountain, thoughtfully placed brick paved walkways, and mature trees on all sides providing complete privacy. These elements combine to make the site feel a world away from the hustle and bustle of the town.”Situated on Lough Road in Lurgan, Glenmore is an eight-minute walk from the train station and  minutes from Lord Lurgan Memorial Park.For the full listing visit propertynewsBelfast Most ReadUVF tip-offs lead PSNI to ponds close to where Lisa Dorrian disappearedLynda Bryans: why I split from Presbyterian ChurchCo Down man who threatened to behead Robin Swann told to write grovelling letter of apologyI’m no UDA loan shark, Carrick man says after PSNI Task Force raidNorthern Ireland Executive ‘reluctant’ to bring forward wet bars re-opening datesTop VideosPlayVideo: X-rated footage of woman stripping outside a Comber bar branded #disgusting#PlayWorld’s largest cargo plane leaves Belfast with oxygen generators for India to help Covid crisisPlayVideo: Lewd footage filmed outside a Comber barLatest Northern IrelandUUP’s Beattie and Butler in frame to lead partyVeterans’ Commissioner raises concern at ‘incomplete’ Narrow Water legacy reportCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  new cases reported as minister claims high northwest infection rates ‘not a border issue’Donnelly opposed to border travel restrictionsThird of UK adults fully vaccinated against Covid-, figures showLatestQueen’s Speech to feature planning system overhaul – reportMalware attack on US pipeline linked to DarkSide criminal groupJudge to oversee libel fight between Countdown presenter and former Corbyn aideWhat to expect from the Prime Minister’s latest announcementIreland steps further out of lockdown,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The answer is none.”Mr Hutchings’s trial is due to go ahead at Belfast Crown Court in front of a judge sitting without a jury in what was formerly known as a Diplock court. He is in need of kidney dialysis on a regular basis and will require treatment throughout the duration of the trial.During the rally on Saturday, hundreds of bikers rode through London which was organised after a trial against two paratroopers accused of murdering Official IRA leader Joe McCann collapsed earlier this month.The march came days after it emerged the government is reportedly planning to ban prosecutions of former British soldiers who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Any actions involving war crimes, genocide or torture will not be included.The move is to be announced in Queen Elizabeth#s speech on May , coinciding with the findings of a coroner’s inquest into the killing by soldiers of  people in Ballymurphy in . Former British Army officer Mr Mercer resigned as minister over legal protections for British troops who fought during the conflict. The PPS has been asked for a response.

The guidelines, spread over two documents, offer bespoke advice depending on the category of care setting involved. “I fully recognise the importance of visiting for those who are receiving care. I hope this guidance will be widely welcomed, said Mr Swann. “It is also important to remember that the threat from COVID- remains very real. Everyone has a vital role to play when it comes to safe visiting. That includes social distancing, hand hygiene and not visitingyou are feeling unwell yourself.      Visiting was only ever restricted because it was absolutely necessary to do so to protect patients and residents from the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV- virus and subsequent development of COVID- infection. Given the progress that has been made against the virus, the time is now right to take steps to carefully re-introduce visiting. I welcome the work completed to draw up these updated guidance documents and hope that by implementing them we will take another step along the road to recovery.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Shiels delivered the League Cup, their last piece of silverware. His son Dean was again part of the success in a - victory over Cobh Ramblers at the Brandywell. It wasnt enough to save his job. His tenure as manager coincided with the death of Derry skipper and club legend Ryan McBride, something that affected him badly. Kenny read out an emotional poem, In Your Absence, at Ryans funeral, which was greeted with a rapturous applause. “We lost eight players in the August of the third year,” Kenny states. “They wanted away some of them. I made a couple of bad signings, which you do.” Part of him wanted to stay, but he sensed an element of the dressing room wasnt in his corner. “I felt it,” he admits. “Ive always prided myself in having a good dynamic in the dressing room. In the professional game, you have a term where you are doing well and a term when it is not so good.” The mutual decision saw them part ways. He knows that bad times are inevitable. It could happen in his current role. “It happens to everybody,” Kenny admits. *** Carrick Rangers win over Glentoran was a seismic result in its own right, but one thing pleased Kenny Shiels more, watching his side pass them off the pitch. “I had a style of play and I still have it,” Kenny now states. “We got on the ball and we play, with our passing style and patterns.” He enjoys the tactical side of the game, but taking charge of Northern Ireland women was a dferent preposition. Transforming them into the first side to qualy for the European Championships is top of the tree in a footballing career that is glittered with success. “If you dig deep into it,” Kenny explains. “These girls hadnt won a match in almost four years, prior to us coming in.” Magherafelts Simone Magilland Rebecca Hollowayare the sole professional players. Sarah McFadden, also from Magherafelt, plays part-time with Durham. The rest are amateur. The fallow spell had corroded any bleak sign of confidence. Standing in Greenmount College, with felt tip pen in hand, their new manager steered his sides mentality in a very definite direction. Two words were etched onto the flip-chart...trust and integrity. His two cornerstones. “You cant have one without the other and I told them they were the focal points in their time with me,” Shiels said. “Thats what we work off, in everything we do. They are related to team spirit and teamwork in any sport.” Even now, sitting on his sofa, reciting that first meeting, his eyes are dancing. You can see how he was able to hold a team in the palm of his hand. It wasnt about just trusting each other. The squad needed to believe in the staff, the process of improvement. But, most of all, they had to trust themselves. “You cant get better without trust,” he told them. “The best and most important relationship you can have anywhere in the world, with any person...is the relationship with yourself. “If you dont trust and believe in yourself, and you havent got a strong relationship with yourself, youll never achieve anything in your le.” Shiels had to pick them off the canvas. Unlike a club environment, there is no transfer market. It was a case of building a team from scratch. In the opposite corner, they were pitting themselves against players from Barcelona and Lyon, stars from the top English clubs, Manchester City, Arsenal and Cha. “Wales, who we eliminated over two games, they have a full team, maybe  of them, playing in the Womens Super League,” Shiels adds. Their resolve was tested by two - defeats by former European and World Champions Norway, either side of their two draws with Wales. “My full backs go forward, we play an attacking game,” Shiels points out. “Norway beat us - in Belfast, but in the second half, we had the same or more possession than them and it was a great learning curve.” Northern Ireland finished the group with four wins, twice each against Belarus and the Faroe Islands to book their play-off with Ukraine. Simone Magill and Rachel Furness celebrate Northern Irelands - win over Belarus in the Dinamo National Olympic Stadium, Minsk.As part of the preparations, Shiels accepted an approach to play England in St Georges Park, something seen as a gamble of sorts. After rebuilding the confidence, a hiding, by more than six goals, couldve set them back. Trailing - after facing a stf breeze, Northern Ireland played much better in the second-half but went down - in the end, but Shiels was happy. It was another learning curve. Going into the first leg of the play-off, Shiels had four players out with cruciate ligament injuries, Lauren Wade had an ankle injury and goalscorer Rachel Furness hobbled off minutes with a broken ankle. A Magill goal saw Shiels side come home with a - win from Ukraine before winning - in the second leg, to book their place in the finals. “They have  million of a population and have recently been in the finals,” he said of Ukraines pedigree. Of the  teams in next summers finals, ranked by coefficient, only Scotland from the top  ranked teams have failed to qualy. Northern Ireland are ranked th. “We are in with the big shots now,” Shiels points out. The rankings are based on results, discipline, performances, essentially anything quantiable. “The coefficient we got in the fth year, was twice as much as the other four years combined. That is massive.” He has come a long way from dribbling through the tackles on the tarmac of Beagh Primary School, but Shiels is still leading the way. And hes far from finished.\",\"keywords\":\"free articles,Kenny Shiels,Northern Ireland,Roys Chicks,Maghera,Derry City,Soccer\",\"articleSection\":\"Home\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"Maghera man Kenny Shiels transformed theNorthern Ireland womens team, without a win for four years, to qualy for next summers European Championships.

Michael McMullan sat down to hear his story...From Kenny Shiels front door, through the hall and kitchen, into the sun-room of his Maghera home sets the scene. A framed Northern Ireland jersey on the wall. Snaps of his son Dean in the colours of Rangers and Hibernian, with three outstretched fingers symbolising his hat-tricks. A glistening picture of Kenny and Dean, grinning from ear to ear, with the Scottish League Cup after Kilmarnocks  success, sticks out from a row of framed mementos. There is no doubt this is a football house. Dean is now the manager of Dungannon Swts. His other son, Jody, manages the local cross community team Upperlands Aces where Kenny is the Chairman. googletag.cmd.push “It is only a title,” he admits. Football is in the blood. “I mark out the pitch, cut the grass...just trying to keep them going.” One of his daughters, Lauren, is married to Coleraine manager Oran Kearney. Armagh City manager Shea Campbell is married to Grace. His we Gwens brothers were footballers. You soon get the picture of the football discussion bouncing around the dinner table. On a Thursday afternoon, on the same day he signed a two-year extension to his contract as Northern Ireland womens manager, Shiels welcome is a warm one. He sips on a cuppa, relaxed, just shooting the breeze. Talking football comes naturally. googletag.cmd.push It was always football, even at the age of two. In hospital for a hernia operation, Kenny cried his eyes out. His mother, Elizabeth, tried to pacy him. But, it wasnt the pain, rather, someone had taken his ball. Once it was ed, the tears stopped. “It must be in my genes somewhere...I was football mad,” Kenny utters. He turned  weeks ago, but the glint remains in his eye. Before Covid- took hold, he was a regular at the nearby leisure centre. The mantra is early to bed, early to rise and practice what you preach. Another passion is music. Tucked in the corner of the kitchen is a record player, with a selection of LPs. Front of the pile is his favourite, John Prine.     “Music is just great,” Kenny offers, painting a picture of the power generated by Labi Sfres Something Inside So Strong. As the Northern Ireland team are about to leave their hotel, the words of the song set the scene. The song changes, depending on the atmosphere. The words and crescendo...they both matter. Shiels gained a degree in psychology along his footballing journey. As he speaks, he picks his words well. An hour in his company gives a taste of how Northern Ireland women, who went four years without a win, will mix with Europes elite next summer. *** Shiels first gig in management came in Beagh Primary School at the age of eight. The nearby, much bigger, Maghera County school came to play a friendly match. “Shiels...pick that team,” bellowed Principal Mr Gillen. “It was a hiding to nothing,” said Shiels of the game, in which he helped himself to five goals in an eight all draw. “There were no tactics,” Kenny laughs. “I got the ball and dribbled. They were trying to kick lumps out of me, but couldnt get near me.” Football was never away from the family home on a chicken farm on the outskirts of Maghera. Kenny was fourth of nine children, which included eight boys. Their father Roy had installed lights in the front yard. Every Saturday night, theyd re-emerge after Match of the Day, singing the tune as they raced outside, playing until after midnight. “My father was a Unionist Councillor...this town was polarised at one time,” Kenny points out. Roy Shiels was able to drink in any of the  pubs in Maghera. One of the few that could. “He got houses for everybody, no matter what creed they were...he was a very popular man.” With a deep interest in football, Roy formed a team comprising Catholics from the upper part of the town and Protestants from the bottom end. “He was bringing communities together to go and compete together in a sporting environment,” Kenny proudly states. “They came together and became friends to this day. Larry Cudden, who played for us, texted me a few minutes ago.” Roy took a cattle trailer, with the whole team in it and sometimes a couple in the boot of the car. It wouldnt conform with todays regulations. Roys Chicks, as they were called, hammered everyone in sight in tournaments across the North. After bagging seven goals in a game, Kenny was accused of being overage. The following year, the Chicks went international, on a five-day trip to France. Seamus Heffron, a French teacher on his year out, helped Roy organise the trip, which was funded by a raffle for a ball signed by the England and Spanish national teams. “Off they went to France, in the late seventies,” said Kenny, now too old to go. “Children got to Portrush for a weekend and that was it.” Kenny was football mad and sneaked away for a fleeting Gaelic football spell with Glen minors in , at the height of the troubles. On the Saturday evening hed leave a kitbag in a lane near his home. The following morning, his mother would have him kitted out in a shirt and tie for Sunday school. “I would change into my ordinary clothes and go on to a game,” he recalls. “Playing Gaelic, when I think back at the height of the troubles, I was mincemeat. It was a brave thing to do.” While his toe to hand wasnt up to scratch as a newcomer to the game, he just dribbled his way through defences. *** An ankle injury at the age of  threatened to end the promising Shiels football career. Medical advice told him to hang up his boots, but he ploughed on. He went on to play for Distillery, Coleraine, Ballymena and Larne in the Irish league. In his third spell with Tobermore United, as player manager, he brought home silverware before a call out of the blue gave him his big break in management. “It was the day of my fathers funeral,” Kenny remembers. “I can still see it. I came home from the funeral, I was hanging up my coat and the phone rang.” Bottom of the table Carrick Rangers were offering him the manager post. The following season, he led them to the County Antrim Shield. After a semi-final win over Glenavon, they defeated then league champions Glentoran in the final. “That was a fantastic giant killing act,” he said of their - replay win. The Glens had taken English professional player Billy Whitehirst for the final, whereas Kenny built a team by dipping into local junior clubs Roe Valley, Dungiven and Magherafelt Sky Blues. Brian Martin scored the first goal, with David Montgomery netting the winner. When Felix Healy resigned as Coleraine manager midway through the   season, a Bannsiders fan like his father, Shiels was headhunted to steer the ship. Coleraine narrowly missed out on a place in the top flight, as the old -team ision split into two leagues for the first time. The following season, with his younger brother Sammy banging in the goals, Kenny got Coleraine promoted and won the inaugural Irish News Cup, a competition for North West Clubs in the Irish League and League of Ireland. After six years with Coleraine, he had a spell with Moyola Park before taking charge of Ballymena United in mid-season. He was unable to save them from the drop to the second tier. After two seasons, which saw them finish as low as fth, Shiels rebuilt the team. His now son in law Shea Campbell was leading the attack when they gained promotion and with ex Nottingham Forest striker Nigel Jemson on board, they finished sixth in the top flight and qualied for Europe via the Intertoto Cup. Following a draw with Danish side Odense, they lost the second leg. After leaving the Showgrounds, Kenny took over at Larne, but at the time, he was appointed as manager of Northern Ireland Us, who he steered to the  European Championships. “That was the only time they qualied for Europe,” said Shiels. “We beat Belgium away and Scotland away to qualy, that was massive.” At the tournament in France, Northern Ireland came up against a Cesc Fagravebregas-led Spain and the hosts that included Karim Benzema. The eight years with the Us helped him secure a job in England, the Head of Youth at Tranmere Rovers, where he stayed for three seasons before taking over as Mixu Paatelainens number two at Kilmarnock. When Paatelainen moved to take charge of Finland, Shiels was promoted to manager. The  season proved to be a fantastic season. He became the first Killie manager to beat Rangers twice in one season. Ally McCoist was looking to equal an -year record by going  away games unbeaten, but Kilmarnock overturned them at Rugby Park. When the sides met in thefixture at a packed Ibrox, Shiels son Dean scored the  minute winner. In the League Cup, Kilmarnock went all the way to their final meeting with Celtic at Hampden Park without conceding a goal. Goalkeeper Cammy Bells inspirational performance kept a clean sheet in the decider. Shiels brought Lee Johnston and Dieter Van Tornhout off the bench, with both combining for the latter to score the winning goal to take the title and cap off a fine season. Kenny and Dean Shiels celebrate Kilmarnocks  Scottish Cup success. The following season, Shiels led Killie to victory over Celtic at Parkhead, but after finishing ninth in the table, triggering a get-out clause, allowed the club to sack him,they ended up in the bottom four. It sparked protests by fans, disappointed with the clubs decision. Shiels had spells at Scottish side Greenock Morton and BEC Tero Sasana in Thailand, before joining Derry City in . In his first two seasons, the Candystripes finished third and fourth, qualying for lucrative spots in Europe, where they beat Dinamo Minsk. “What a result that was,” Kenny said of the win. “It was the first game in their new refurbished stadium and I later took Northern Irelandback there when we played Belarus.” In his third season in charge, Derry City finished third bottom of the table following a poor run of results. Shiels delivered the League Cup, their last piece of silverware. His son Dean was again part of the success in a - victory over Cobh Ramblers at the Brandywell. It wasnt enough to save his job. His tenure as manager coincided with the death of Derry skipper and club legend Ryan McBride, something that affected him badly. Kenny read out an emotional poem, In Your Absence, at Ryans funeral, which was greeted with a rapturous applause. “We lost eight players in the August of the third year,” Kenny states. “They wanted away some of them.

It could happen in his current role. “It happens to everybody,” Kenny admits. *** Carrick Rangers win over Glentoran was a seismic result in its own right, but one thing pleased Kenny Shiels more, watching his side pass them off the pitch. “I had a style of play and I still have it,” Kenny now states. “We got on the ball and we play, with our passing style and patterns.” He enjoys the tactical side of the game, but taking charge of Northern Ireland women was a dferent preposition. Transforming them into the first side to qualy for the European Championships is top of the tree in a footballing career that is glittered with success. “If you dig deep into it,” Kenny explains. “These girls hadnt won a match in almost four years, prior to us coming in.” Magherafelts Simone Magilland Rebecca Hollowayare the sole professional players. Sarah McFadden, also from Magherafelt, plays part-time with Durham. The rest are amateur. The fallow spell had corroded any bleak sign of confidence. Standing in Greenmount College, with felt tip pen in hand, their new manager steered his sides mentality in a very definite direction. Two words were etched onto the flip-chart...trust and integrity. His two cornerstones. “You cant have one without the other and I told them they were the focal points in their time with me,” Shiels said. “Thats what we work off, in everything we do. They are related to team spirit and teamwork in any sport.” Even now, sitting on his sofa, reciting that first meeting, his eyes are dancing. You can see how he was able to hold a team in the palm of his hand. It wasnt about just trusting each other. The squad needed to believe in the staff, the process of improvement. But, most of all, they had to trust themselves. “You cant get better without trust,” he told them. “The best and most important relationship you can have anywhere in the world, with any person...is the relationship with yourself. “If you dont trust and believe in yourself, and you havent got a strong relationship with yourself, youll never achieve anything in your le.” Shiels had to pick them off the canvas. Unlike a club environment, there is no transfer market. It was a case of building a team from scratch. In the opposite corner, they were pitting themselves against players from Barcelona and Lyon, stars from the top English clubs, Manchester City, Arsenal and Cha. “Wales, who we eliminated over two games, they have a full team, maybe  of them, playing in the Womens Super League,” Shiels adds. Their resolve was tested by two - defeats by former European and World Champions Norway, either side of their two draws with Wales. “My full backs go forward, we play an attacking game,” Shiels points out. “Norway beat us - in Belfast, but in the second half, we had the same or more possession than them and it was a great learning curve.” Northern Ireland finished the group with four wins, twice each against Belarus and the Faroe Islands to book their play-off with Ukraine. Simone Magill and Rachel Furness celebrate Northern Irelands - win over Belarus in the Dinamo National Olympic Stadium, Minsk.  As part of the preparations, Shiels accepted an approach to play England in St Georges Park, something seen as a gamble of sorts. After rebuilding the confidence, a hiding, by more than six goals, couldve set them back. Trailing - after facing a stf breeze, Northern Ireland played much better in the second-half but went down - in the end, but Shiels was happy. It was another learning curve. Going into the first leg of the play-off, Shiels had four players out with cruciate ligament injuries, Lauren Wade had an ankle injury and goalscorer Rachel Furness hobbled off minutes with a broken ankle. A Magill goal saw Shiels side come home with a - win from Ukraine before winning - in the second leg, to book their place in the finals. “They have  million of a population and have recently been in the finals,” he said of Ukraines pedigree. Of the  teams in next summers finals, ranked by coefficient, only Scotland from the top  ranked teams have failed to qualy. Northern Ireland are ranked th. “We are in with the big shots now,” Shiels points out. The rankings are based on results, discipline, performances, essentially anything quantiable. “The coefficient we got in the fth year, was twice as much as the other four years combined. That is massive.” He has come a long way from dribbling through the tackles on the tarmac of Beagh Primary School, but Shiels is still leading the way. And hes far from finished.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Collie McGurk took them from the Nicky Rackard Cup to the cusp of a Christy Ring Cup Final. An inspired goalkeeping performance from Kildare goalkeeper Paddy McKenna thwarted theirto Croke Park. Two years ago, John McEvoy came in as boss and an impressive season took them back to the league decider, where Derry lost to Wicklow in a low scoring afternoon at a blustery Inniskeen. A day when Brian Oacuteg McGilligan hobbled off after  minutes and the appearance of Brendan Rogers wasnt able to spark the goal they needed to take them over the line. googletag.cmd.push Last year, after ticking along nicely, Covid kicked in and when the league final was played, Derry werent at the races. It wasnt even a contest. Dominic Woody McKinley came in as joint manager this season, alongside Cormac Donnelly. McKinley, who managed both Derry senior hurlers and camogs in the past, knows what he wants from this season. “My personal opinion is that the National League is more important than the championship to us,” McKinley outlined. He has been around the block. An All-Ireland winner with Loughgiel in , an All-Ireland Final appearance with Antrim in , he coached Antrim at all levels and was a major cog in Slaughtneils rise to the pinnacle of camogie. googletag.cmd.push Sitting at Derry hurlers press evening last week, there is enthusiasm as he talks hurling. The words flow with a passion. The facial expressions dont tell any lies. Its about getting Derry up a level. There is a hurt that hurlers below the elite, top level counties dont get the recognition. Counties like Derry. Seven or eight of their squad are capable of playing at any level. When the Champion  - the All-Star team from the Christy Ring, Nicky Rackard and Lory Meagher Cups – was announced, Derry werent represented. “I suppose you have to earn that,” Woody admits. “The only way is to keep your head down, work hard and then people will recognise you as a group.     “I want Derry to get up a league, you get more of a profile for the players and get to play against better teams. “If you are playing at a higher standard, it is more attractive for the media and hurling people. If I had a choice, Id love to get moved up a league.” As our conversation continues, Liaison Officer Terry Gray issues a list of the Derry squad. Of the  names, Alan Grant is in rehab from a knee injury last year. The  is open, but McKinley is happy with the squad. Brian Cassidy, Niall Ferris and Gerald Bradley are back on board to give them extra attacking options. There is afor Slaughtneil goalkeeper Oisin ODoherty, who last donned the Derry goalkeeper jersey in  having played outfield the previous year. “That was the first thing we looked at before we got the job, could me and Cormac draw all these players all back in again,” he points out. Dual players arent on the table. Chrissy McKaigue and Brendan Rogers have played under the last two management teams. But it was a balancing act. The fixture calendar doesnt permit it. Mark Craig is managing his long-term back injury. Brian Cassidy and Conor McAllister are doubts for the Mayo game, but everyone should be available for selection. Challenge games arent on the menu. It frustrates McKinley, so an in-house game last weekend will have to do as they sharpen the focus for the season ahead. “A lot of wee niggly injuries are there now that club training has started as well,” adds McKinley, as frustration creeps into his voice, from the increased workload on the players. “We want to manage it so they are there for the full season for club and county.” There is a plea to clubs, who wont have their serious business until the heel of the year. “These matches are very important for Derry hurling as well,” he adds, while hailing the support of Chairman Stephen Barker. “He is very fair,” Woody states. “He is wanting progress. It is a serious business and we need to be serious about getting themup a level and thats what the players want.” The closest Derry came to promotion was their  decider, a day when Wicklows goal was the dference. Its Derrys failure to find the net that has left them on the wrong side of tight games. During the off-season, selector Conor Murray has been looking into the scoring statistics and Derrys know where the gains are to be made. “He came back to us and it is interesting reading,” McKinley said. “If you were looking at it from another teams point of view, you could think theyll capitalise on our team by blocking a couple of players off in our forward line and wed be in serious bother. “So we are looking for a greater spread of scores,you look at the players we have, there is no doubt we can.” McKinley questions Derrys team play, shot selection...all the pieces of the puzzle of their scoring conundrum. “Thats what weve been going over this last few weeks and hopefully we can get more out of it,” he continues. “We are even recording what we are scoring in our training games, what we do in each sector, to seeour scoring averages are up.” Now the challenge is taking it to Castlebar on Sunday.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In March , Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee refusedClanmil Housing Association permission to build a four-storey complex comprised of  apartments at Victoria Road. However, Clanmil appealed the decision and it has now been overturned. Local planning officers had described the location as ‘possibly the most dficult regeneration site’ in the city. However, the officers had recommended that councillors approve the application for the Victoria Road apartments as the application was ‘entirely compliant’. In their report, planning officers stated that they believed it would reinvigorate the riverfront land and put an end to anti-social behaviour at the site. googletag.cmd.push  Among the objections raised by councillors had been that there was no parking provided within the plans for the Victoria Road apartments. At the meeting in March , local councillors said they believed a parking ban ‘discriminated’ against people with disabilities. At last year’s meeting, Hugh Hegarty from the Victoria Park Residents Group said the apartment complex design looked like a ‘horric brutalist East German style eyesore’. Mr Hegarty said pollution and parking problems would be exacerbatedresidents were to park on Spencer Road and Duke Street. A lack of space in the area has already resulted in ‘hazardous parking’ on Victoria Road and he envisaged problems at the site with numerous couriers and taxis arriving. googletag.cmd.push In response, a representative for Clanmil said it is a ‘highly accessible’ location with bus stops and train travel nearby. The housing association claimed that the design respects the history of the site, the city’s shirt factory heritage and complements existing buildings. A report by the Planning Appeals Commission into the matter has now found that the objections were not sustained and overturned the decision to refuse planning permission. The decision to overturn the councils refusal decision has been criticised by local rail campaigners, Into the West. The land at Victoria Road was previously part of the Derry to Strabane railway line which closed in .     Into the West has been campaigning for the line to be reopened and they have described the decision to allow the apartment complex to be built on the site as a disaster. A building there will make it impossible to restore a railway line along that route in future – making it extremely unlikely we will ever see rail from Derry to Strabane or Letterkenny again, said Steve Bradley, chair of Into the West. Without a route to Strabane, there can be no direct rail services form Derry or Donegal to Dublin. And as Derry has a bigger population than every other town on the former Derry-Portadown rail route,our city can no longer be included in that proposed reopening then the viability of restoring rail to places like Omagh, Strabane, Enniskillen, Dungannon and Letterkenny also collapses. In short – building  apartments in that location will destroy any future for rail across the west of Ulster and prevent it being ed to Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh.

Dr Glynn said he is hopeful that additional measures will not be required for the county in the coming weeks and he is confident that the situation in Donegal will improve quickly. He was speaking at a press briefing for the media in Donegal on Wednesday following the fallout from comments made by chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan last Friday about the high incidence of Covid- in the county. googletag.cmd.push There has been a backlash in Donegal to the tone of the comments Dr Holohan made when he said there were concerns about things happening in the county that “even the dogs on the street” know shouldn’t be happening. Figures released at the press briefing put the national incidence rate in the county at  cases per , people compared to a national rate of . The highest rates are in the Milford local electoral area at . and the Letterkenny area where the rate is .. The lowest rate in the county is in the Donegal LEA at .. The briefing was told there were  GP referrals for testing in the county on Tuesday, an increase of % on the same day last week. googletag.cmd.push Dr Glynn said the concerns were raised last week so that people can take protective measures and ensure the situation does not get worse. He said there is a bigger number of smaller clusters in Donegal than in other parts of the country. “It was not meant as blame. It certainly was not made as a threat,” he said. “It would be very strange for us to preside over a situation where incidence is very high and increasing in a county and not draw attention to that.” At the briefing, director of public health for the HSE in the north-west, Dr Anthony Breslin, highlighted a number of clusters that have occurred due to events in the county in recent weeks, including awake, a family gathering and an th birthday party.     The events resulted in dozens of cases and infections in workplaces, in families and at a school. One social gathering has been linked to  cases of Covid-, he said. Dr Glynn said that there are concerns about the situation in the county and that some people in Donegal have “pushed the boundaries”. “We are concerned about the current incidence. That is not to say that Donegal has not come a very long way over the past number of months, just as the rest of the country has, and that can only have happened because the majority of people are trying to do the right thing,” he said. “This is not in any way a reflection on the majority but clearly there are a number of incidents where people have pushed the boundaries. “We have seen that in other counties, it is not just in Donegal. But I suppose the dference at the moment versus some other places where we have particularly high incidences, is that there are large clusters driving incidences. “In Donegal, it seems to be a little bit more widespread with a bigger number of smaller clusters which makes it that little bit harder to control. Sowe can continue to emphasise, andwe can get people who have been pushing the boundaries a little bit just to comply that bit more over the coming weeks, we should see incidence drop quickly in Donegal.” He said we can not get away from the fact that the high incidence rates in parts of the county are due to the fact the disease is being transmitted from person to person. “It gets transmitted from person to person when people come into contact with one another and when for whatever reason masks are not worn, distance is not kept, people who are symptomatic don’t self-isolate. “Right now we are seeing a higher incidence in Donegal than we have in other parts of the country and in that regard, it is incumbent on us as doctors to point out our concerns so that people can take proactive actions because there are many people who remain very vulnerable to this disease over the coming weeks,” he said. “All we are asking people in Donegal to do is to protect themselves and their families. We are not proposing any dferent measures for any one part of Donegal as things currently stand, and I would be hopeful and optimistic given the level of engagement over the past number of days that we wont be looking at some sort of additional measures for the county or any part of the county over the coming weeks.” He said the priority for people over the coming weeks is to meet people outside. “As far as is possible at all, do not meet up with friends or extended families or do not have parties inside. Inside gives this virus such an advantage in terms of transmission,” he said. “Last January Donegal had an incidence of , per ,. It is now  per ,. It is the highest in the country but it’s an order of magnitude lower than where it was and that’s down to the work of the majority doing most of the right things most of the time.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Council are coming together to set up and manage the Creative Encounters project. The aim of the project is to create a one-stop online directory for people and families planning a day out in either or both counties. The councils have now issued a tender seeking companies who could create such a directory. In a joint statement included in the tender documents, the two councils state that they had commissioned an audience survey across the north west in a bid to better understand the barriers to cultural engagement faced by our citizens. googletag.cmd.push “This research was used to inform a subsequent Audience Development Plan which identied older people and families as two key audience target segments. “Older people were identied as a segment that was the least engaged with cultureand the partner councils were keen to ensure that this imbalance was addressed. “Families were identied as a market opportunity, an audience segment upon which the sector could focus the rebuilding of audiences and participatory engagement as we emerge from the worst of the Covid crisis. “The NW Audience Survey research findings and the NW Audience Development Plan The plan incorporates a range of actions designed to encourage better engagement of the target segments.” googletag.cmd.push As part of the process, the councils have looked at websites such as familyexplorers, dayoutwiththekids and fantasticforfamilies. They now want to create a similar website focused on the Derry and Donegal regions. “In essence the project is designed to make it simpler for families to plan days out by providing all the practical information in one place,” the council statement concluded.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Criticising the lack of facilities at Ballyarnett Country Park, Davy Cregan said as a disabled and wheel- chair-bound person enough is enough. “There are no toilets facilities and as result people have to take themselves and their children to Northside shopping centre for toilets.

The owners, the Trufelli family, put the site of the amusement arcade up for sale in October . However, the process has been hampered by the pandemic. In a statement today, the Trufelli family said that as thingsto a more favourable economic environment, it is their intention to re-market the business for sale. “Whilst our hope is that we will be able to sell the business as a going concern, we recognise that it may not be possible to find a suitable purchaser,” the statement said. googletag.cmd.push “As a result, we have appointed Savills and Philip Tweedie  Company to market the site as both a going concern and a development opportunity. “Barry’s continues to remain closed in line with Covid restrictions and will not re-open until the sale process has concluded.” The Barrys site has been placed on the market with a guide price of pound.m. The high-profile seafront site is situated in the heart of the town, between the newly renovated Portrush Train Station and The West Bay Beach. The sale is being handled by joint agents, Savills and Philip Tweedie  Company, on behalf of Barry’s Amusements and is being marketed as a development opportunity but equally would not disregard the potential purchase as a going concern. googletag.cmd.push A feasibility study undertaken by Savills has revealed that the site could be developed for several uses, including a -bed hotel,  residential dwellings or a combination of both, in addition to leisure and recreational facilities. Barry’s Amusements first opened at  Eglinton St. in  and has remained one of the most popular family attractions for visitors to the area.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He wrote: “May I say what a privilege it has been to lead our party in these dficult and trying times while leadership of a political party has many highs and lows, it has been my work with our elected representatives, in particular our MLA team, that has given me the greatest confidence for the future of our great party.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Qualiers RDerry - Longford -It took Derry a while to get going, but a devastating  minutes of football demolished the home side at Pearse Park. Derry were fortunate to be just three points down at the break, with the move of Enda Muldoon to midfield before half time turning the game. googletag.cmd.push Anthony Tohill, who scored two goals, was the major beneficiary of Muldoons sublime long passing. Current Longford manager Padraic Davis and Gavin Diamond were on song for their teams, but it was Tohills second goal that rounded off a convincing Derry win.

Longfords win clinched promotion, as the first placed team. Elsewhere, Wexfords one-point win at home to mid-table Carlow saw them finish second, with Derry in third place.     Jamsie Martin hit - from play in the first half, as the home side shot into a - to - interval lead, but they had to thank goalkeeper Gavin Tonra for his two point blank saves to deny Paddy Bradley.

Trevor Smullen netted for Longford as Derry led - to - at the break. The game was still in its first minute when Bradley took advantage of a defensive mistake to fire the ball into the net. In injury-time Bradley netted from the penalty spot after he was fouled. The gap increased to three early in the second half before Longford hit four points without reply. David Barden wasted an excellent goal chance for Longford and Derry took advantage as Joe Diver pointed. But Longford fought back and edged ahead after three unanswered points only for Paddy Bradley to equalise.

Qualiers RLongford - Derry -Longford earned a dramatic win in a chaotic finish at Pearse Park. There was controversy too. Derrys Barry McGoldrick, who had marauded forward from corner-back to grab two goals, picked up a second yellow card after a melee in the Longford goalmouth in the th minute of injury time. Minutes later, Derry sub Joe Diver scored a goal reminiscent of Joe Sheridans against Louth two previously - this time referee Michael Duffy awarded a free out and Longford were safe. Longford had led by three at the break, - to -, thanks largely to the accuracy from frees of Sean McCormack. Paddy Bradley showed all his class too in the opening phase of the game and was at the heart of anything productive from Derry. McGoldricks first goal levelled the match, finishing coolly, after being set up by Paddy Bradley. His second goal put Derry in the driving seat, despite not playing well. Again McCormack got Longford level and then the home side went in front and on their way to victory.

Thatrsquos not the same as having a formal British Irish Intergovernmental Conference with officials and an agenda, he said.ldquoI have no objectionthey want to talk every day. Thatrsquos a good idea, but I think the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement should be followed and that means there should be a BIIC on a regular and frequent basis. That is what was signed.Speaking weeks after street violence by loyalist protesters erupted in Belfast over issues related to Brexit and the NI Protocol, Mr Ahern said BIIC meetings were very important.ldquoIt does concern me that we havenrsquot had a British Irish Intergovernmental Conference for a long, long time, maybe a few years.Mr Ahern was interviewed by former BBC political correspondent Martina Purdy and former barrister Elaine Kelly, who spoke to the former Taoiseach about peace-building, faith and St Patrick.ldquoThe two governments, the British and Irish governments are the custodians of the Agreement. They are not meeting to discuss these issues. That clearly is not in line with the agreement.ldquoI am not using any other words than what the Agreement usedhellip The agreement says that there must be frequent meetings and you know that should be happening.ldquoThey donrsquot have to be for long. They can be on zoom, Microsoft teams anything you like. They should be having these meetings and where there are dficulties they should be dealing with at those meetings.ldquoIn the absence of those meetings, things can drt. Quite frankly I donrsquot understand why those meetings canrsquot take place.ldquoI donrsquot expect the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach to have a meeting all day ndash they donrsquot have to do that. They could have a meeting for an hour and half. Thatrsquos not going to kill anybody.He said other officials or ministers or institutions within departmental structures could then follow through with the issues.Mr Ahern also spoke about the future of the Catholic Church in Ireland, where he said there must be more involvement of the laity.He said his faith was important to him. ldquoYou donrsquot want to overplay it because you are attacked nowyou do that.ldquoReligion is important to me. I am a believer and I understand it and I read about it and I think itrsquos part of my le and I often think that a lot of people, who have a lot of problems and dficulties - it is because they donrsquot have it.

So my stress levels were abnormally high.ldquoI soon felt like I couldnrsquot feed Edward enough, stress got the better of me at times and my brilliant health visitor Maura pointed me to a local breastfeeding group and also another brilliant lady, my breastfeeding peer support worker Aine Jordan-Doxey, who just completely gave me the confidence and support to keep going.ldquoThe peer breastfeeding group is hosted by a midwe health visitor and contains a beautul bunch of souls who are just there for each other. Wersquore all in the same boat and through this group I have received many tips, tricks and even friends.Despite Joannersquos determination to breastfeed Edward, it wasnrsquot all plain sailing.ldquoBreastfeeding is just the most beautul thing.Yes it can be dficult and absolutely frustrating at times but the benefits far outweigh those short blips, she said.ldquoThe best advice Irsquove ever heard mdash lsquodonrsquot give up on a bad dayrsquo.On a rough day, breastfeeding Edward gave me comfort, knowing I was the reason he is full and happy made me feel so good.ldquoAine gave me so much advice, including certain foods to eat to boost milk supply. Oats, theyrsquore your best friend! And you cannot drink enough water.Soon Joanne had more milk that Edward could take so she began collecting extra milk for the milk bank.She said: ldquoThe bottles arrived and I filled the first ml on December  last year. The donation was nearly full in a month but sadly my dad passed away on January  at the age of . There was a few weeks with no donations as my milk supply ped to an all-time low. Itrsquos just incredible what stress can do to your body.ldquoWell, Aine was there again, checking in, keeping me in chat, and keeping me motivated to keep breastfeeding. I am very lucky to have a wonderful, supportive husband, a close knit family and a close circle of best friends who have been tremendous during this very dficult time.Joanne went on to complete her donation of four litres of milk she calls ldquoliquid gold on Motherrsquos Day and wants to thank Aine for all her help and support.She said: ldquoI fully support every motherrsquos choice to either breastfeed or bottle-feed butanyone was struggling to breastfeed I would strongly recommend taking the support thatrsquos available.ldquoPersonally I am continuing to breastfeed because it gives me a little comfort in this time of grief, itrsquos a moment where I just look into his eyes and feel so needed and loved. So not only for the instantly available nutrition and comfort to my son but for those moments of joy I get from it too.Aine says she is so proud of Joanne mdash not only for continuing to breastfeed during the emotional time of her fatherrsquos illness and death but also for contributing four litres of milk to the Trustrsquos milk bank.The mother-of-threersquos own experience of breastfeeding had been rewarding but also not without its challenges.While she was living in England at the time, she recalled a time when one of her children was not thriving while she was feeding them.ldquoMy doctor and my health visitor both told me to stop breastfeeding my son and it was so frustrating as I knew that was not the problem so I continued on and it turned out that there was something  wrong.She began supporting Joanne in November last year when Edward was five weeks old.ldquoJoanne was exhausted and had been through some dficult nights where Edward wasnrsquot sleeping and was screaming through the night.I remember speaking with her about developmental leaps and what to expect at this stage and the normal infant sleep patterns, said Aine.ldquoFrom the beginning I could tell Joanne had so much passion for breastfeeding and wanted to succeed in every way. Joanne began expressing enough to give Edward a bottle and soon after he started sleeping better, just in time for her toddler to stop sleeping through. Joanne never let this stop her and carried on with minimal sleep.Aine said that when Joanne first mentioned to her about the possibility of donating milk, there were only  donors on the Northern Ireland milk bank.She said ldquoI was so proud as Joanne was the first of my mums to donate and it honestly made me smile at the thought. As usual Joanne just laughed and said it was no big deal as she enjoyed it. It was the first time I disagreed with her as I thought she was doing an extraordinary thing.ldquoWhen I opened her message and saw Edward surrounded by four litres of expressed milk for the milk bank, I was blown away again. What an incredible gt for the sick babies in theneonatal units.ldquoNot only was Joanne potty training a toddler and breastfeeding on demand, but she was expressing for the milk bank. I am so thankful to have been a part of her journey. So often there isnrsquot enough support available for mums especially with breastfeeding, and Covid made it more dficult as the usual support groups had all closed. Thatrsquos why peer support is so valuable as it provides one to one support for mums at the most important time.Aine highlighted the need for support for breastfeeding mums. ldquoWe need to be offering all mums support from the very first chance which is the case for a lot, but sometimes mums donrsquot know about us until itrsquos too late. ldquoI am thankful to Joanne for sharing this experience with me and I know we will still be in touch for a long time.ldquoAnd even though Irsquom sure she will downplay what she has achieved, I can honestly say I am so proud of her and all her hard work.Mothers can be referred to the Trustrsquos breastfeeding support worker through midwery and health visiting services..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Carlisle.jpg","title":"Carlisle’s staff in charity hike in memory of much loved Pat  ","story":"ONE hundred staff and friends at Carlislersquos in Ballynahinch are each walking five miles this week on a sponsored walk in honour of a much-loved colleague who died last month.Pat Greene, who was from Saintfield, died on April , much to the shock and sorrow of everyone at the business.The  year-old had worked for Carlislersquos for  years, starting off as a coal boy, going on to work in all areas of the business and finishing as a work supervisor.Donna Carlisle explained that Pat loved The Proclaimers song Irsquom Gonna Beand it inspired the charity effort from staff members, past and present, and their partners.ldquoIt was Patrsquos favourite song and it had to be on the playlist at all our party nights when we raised money for ious cancer charities.

However, he did not make it through to show his impressive main course and dessert to the judges.Both chefs threw their all into devising four courses, including an appetiser and pre-dessert mdash based on the theme celebrating British innovation.Hopes were high for East Down given that Dundrum chef Alex Browne Greene, from EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, got two dishes to the national final last year and narrowly missed out on being crowned champion of champions at the banquet.Gemmarsquos starter was a twist on gammon, egg and chips, inspired by Kegomatic from Queenrsquos University students and for her fish course, the innovation shown in the building of the Titanic inspired her sea bass fish dish.She used William Clannyrsquos invention of the safety lamp for miners for her main course of lamb and the influence of astronomer Alice Everett as the first woman to work for the Royal Observatory to inspire her dessert, Out of this World.The dessert was her favourite course and she was delighted to have been scored a ten by chef Daniel Clford.ldquoIrsquom known for my desserts so I was really delighted to have got that score from Daniel, said Gemma.ldquoI also took his advice on my main course as therersquos no better person to take advice from and generally scaled back my dishes and made them more refined as the comments back were that there was too much on the plate.While Gemma was proud to have made it through to the regional final, she said she was not disappointed at not going through to the national judging.ldquoTo be honest, it was a bit of a relief as I did not know how I was going to go up against all the other chefs in the national final as I have only been cheffing for seven years and am mostly self-taught, she revealed.Gemma went into the competition, which was filmed last November, full of confidence and determined to do her best.ldquoI think I just went into a zone and concentrated on my own dishes and not to get too caught up in what the other chefs were doing, she said.ldquoPhelim was brilliant on the day and deserved to win and I remember saying on the programme that the better chef won. I hope that he goes on to get a dish to the banquet.While she has been receiving fantastic customer feedback from her popup, A Peculiar Tea, which she has been operating during the lockdowns, Gemma admitted that cooking was not her first career choice.ldquoWhen I left school I actually went to Queenrsquos University to do a nursing degree but a medical issue I experienced meant that I couldnrsquot complete it, she said.She then studied Bio Medical Sciences for a while before going to Ulster University to complete a software engineering degree.Her love of food and cooking mdash inspired by her chef mother mdash was strictly a hobby until the age of  when she took her first job at Slims Kitchen on the Lisburn Road in Belfast where she cut her teeth for a year while doing a Culinary Masters course.For four years Gemma continued studying and working full-time at a iety of great establishments, such as the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast where she rose to head pastry chef, before moving The Old Inn, Crawfordsburn, where she worked all the sections and eventually became sous chef.She has been in Alexanders for the last two years and got the opportunity to become an owner last year.ldquoIt may have taken my several attempts before I found the right career but I was determined not to do any job that I did not absolutely love and was passionate about.Like Gemma, Brunels chef Paul Cunningham hopes to be invited back next year after his disappointing showing this year.The  year-old had hoped to get to the regional judging to please his six-year-old daughter, Farrah.ldquoFarrah and I are massive fans of the show, we watch every year and of course, I wanted to further than I did but Irsquove got over the disappointment now and concentrating on getting the restaurant ready for re-opening, Paul told the Recorder.Paul is known for only using local produce from within a -mile radius of Newcastle and foraging for herbs and plants.His menu reflected his locality and passion for pioneers including Belfast-born Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Isambard Kingdom Brunelrsquos refloating of the SS Great Britain in Dundrum Bay mdash an incident which led him to name his restaurant by the great engineer.Paul only got to cook his starter and main course on the show but said his main course and dessert were showstoppers, with the main course of lamb called Healthy Heart made without using any salt or butter, inspired by Frank Pantridge who invited the portable defibrillator.He also collaborated with Doran Precision Engineering to create a model of the Titanic for one of his dishes and a special dish to show off his dessert, the Atom Smasher, inspired by Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Condemnation.jpg","title":"Condemnation over Murlough vandalism  ","story":"LOCAL politicians have criticised vandals responsible for setting fire to a gate at the Murlough Nature Reserve two weekends ago as  firefighters were battling a huge blaze in the nearby Mournes.The vandals also left behind a trail of rubbish at the internationally acclaimed area with their actions condemned by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Laura Devlin.They say it ldquobeggars belief that while the raging wildfire destroyed  acres of rich habitat across the Mournes, there were people who thought that it was appropriate to start a fire at the Nature Reserve.The politicians also revealed that National Trust staff had to remove  bags of rubbish from the Reserve location on the Sunday the fire in the Mournes was eventually extinguished.Cllr Devlin said as young people drank alcohol and watched the blaze raging across the mountains, they set fire to a pedestrian gate which is also used to prevent Exmore ponies at the Reserve from escaping.ldquoI am really shocked at this behaviour, she said. ldquoBy the Saturday evening, everyone in the locality had an idea of the widespread damage in the Mournes but these iniduals thought it appropriate to cause more damage and potentially risk another blaze.ldquoI have no idea who these iniduals were and how old they are so I am appealing to people young and old.

Since them, it has been reviewing the situation on a monthly basis and confirmed this week that cover remains in place for this month.The news has been welcomed by South Down MP Eddie McGrady, who said the Trust has also confirmed that it has been in contact with Belfast-based anaesthetists to ascertain their long-term commitment to the provision of services at the Downe Hospital and maternity unit.ARDGLASS ndash The crisis facing the fishing industry is to top the agenda at a special meeting hosted by the Provincersquos Agriculture Minister.The talks with Brid Rodgers are expected to take place at her Dundonald Houses headquarters within the next few weeks and involve politicians from Down, Ards and Newry and Mourne councils.Representatives for each of the three areas have already joined forces to draw up a plan to help beleaguered fishermen based in Ardglass, Portavogie and Kilkkeel and have been seeking a meeting with the Minister for some time to discuss the detail of a new strategy they have put together.Miss Rodgers was unable to make space in her diary because of her heavy involvement with the foot and mouth crisis, but she has now confirmed the talks with the local politicians will take place shortly.ANNACLOY ndash A local councillor has welcomed progress on the improvement scheme for the Annacloy Road, outside Downpatrick, and has called on the Roads Service to carry out the work ldquoas a matter of urgency.Cllr Margaret Ritchie said she has for some time been campaigning to have the section of the Annacloy Road from the Kingrsquos Bridge to the Belfast Road ldquosubstantially improved.Describing the road as ldquovery narrow and undulating, Miss Ritchie said that after discussions with Roads Service officials, she was pleased when they informed her last November that the road had been placed on an improvement programme..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Hopes.jpg","title":"Hopes Dunleath Park can be hub for cyclists  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK councillor Gareth Sharvin has welcomed plans to establish a cycle hub at Down Leisure Centre and Dunleath Park in partnership with Cycling Ireland.Two -foot containers will be used ndash one for hosting courses and tutoring, and the other to be used for bike storage, maintenance and a workshop facility.Last weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee approved the scheme, which Cllr Sharvin described as a welcome addition for Dunleath Park and Downpatrick.ldquoThis is the second project item to be planned for Dunleath Park following the SDLPrsquos motion to council calling for the development of sporting and recreational activities at the site, he said.The new cycling hub will compliment and utilise the planned build of a recreational path around the perimeter of Dunleath Park.The cycle hub is part of a new initiative by Cycling Ireland who are working in partnership with local authorities to establish similar facilities across Northern Ireland.Councillor Sharvin added: ldquoThis will be a great addition to the area of Downpatrick and the district.

He had a rare gt for making everyone feel better about themselves and for knowing they always had a friend in him. Facebook notices of his death drew an unprecedented outpouring of tributes and comments from across the region and demonstrated the levels of affection in which Jim was held.As a footballer he had few peers. His time with Downpatrick Rec was marked with cup and league successes, culminating in lting the Steel and Sons Cup in front of record attendances at the Crusaders Seaview ground for the first drawn match and the subsequent replay.Supporters from Downpatrick travelled in their thousands, marking the event one of the most widely celebrated sporting achievements of that era. The gate receipts were the highest ever recorded for the annual showpiece of amateur soccer in Northern Ireland, so much so that for the first time the income exceeded the VAT threshold, which meant tax had to be paid.On the day the Rec won that Steel Cup replay, Distillery tried to sign Jim as he left the pitch. He turned them down with a typically firm but gentlemanly refusal and stayed with the Rec for another four years, helping them to add to their cabinet of silverware.Jim lsquoCootrsquo Connolly was a player of exceptional talent. A classy and cultured defender, he is remembered for his unique ability to rise above other players, most of whom had a distinct height advantage, but lacked Jimrsquos trademark for timing his runs and hanging in the air for longer than ought to have been humanly possible. Many a spectator were left speechless after matches, shaking their heads in puzzlement at his exploits. Yes, he was that good.Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran, who was the Downpatrick Rec goalkeeper, said it was ldquosometimes scary playing behind Jim. ldquoWhen I walked with Coot or talked with him or more often had a beer with him, I felt I was in the presence of greatness.So much so that everyone wanted a part of that, and his we Angie and family had to learn to share Coot because he just made you feel good about yourself. For that we as a community are eternally grateful to them. His footballing ability was absolutely extraordinary. I played behind him and said to him on a few occasions lsquoCoot you scare me. The things you do defy the laws of physics and gravityrsquo. He would jump for a ball start to come down and without touching the ground go up again. I swear it.Tony added: ldquoThe world is a sadder place for his leaving but somewhere up there hersquoll be playing with the guys that have gone before him and maybe BFwill be managing. I hope they will keep me a place on their team.Former Rec manager Jim Prior was devastated to learn of Jimrsquos death. ldquoLike all his former teammates I am cut to ribbons that Jim is no longer with us. As a footballer, he was simply out of this world. The other players on our most successful team were in awe of Jim and all loved him. He had star quality written all over him.He could do things that others couldnrsquot do, whether that was on the training ground or in the toughest of matches. I canrsquot remember him putting in less than a five-star performance.The Recrsquos former club secretary, Patricia Murrayremembers Jim as the baby of the Steel Cup team. ldquoMy deepest and heartfelt sympathies to Angela and all his family and friends. His laugh, smile and craic will be truly missed, Patricia said.Jim Connollyrsquos impact with Downpatrick was repeated at his next clubs, Ards and Killyleagh YC, where he suffered a career ending injury. He had been with the club for just two seasons but left an indelible mark. One of Killyleaghrsquos stalwart players, Philip Jennings, posted his own tribute. ldquoGreat memories of watching Jim for the great Down Rec team and playing with him at Ards and Killyleagh. A real legend in local football, but even more than that, just an absolute gentleman.Despite his injury, Jim ed to football several years later to turn out for the Downshire Hospital, with whom he won an all-Ireland medal winner in  under the management of Brian Cheetham.But the question always remained about what could have become of this precocious talent had he been able to stick with one of English footballrsquos premier clubs.His trials there were cut short by homesickness, more particularly an abiding love for his recently widowed mother. Downpatrick was his anchor. Family, friends, and the Stream Street precinct of his youth were too deeply ingrained for the young Connolly to ever contemplate leaving them behind. It was never a regret for Jim. Indeed,anything, the choice to stay reinforced his passion and love for the area. He perhaps never knew how deeply those feelings of connection were ed by those who had the good fortune to know him.Jimrsquos trials were at Nottingham Forest, Newcastle, and Everton, all three organised by local scout Bill Oakes. Everton came closest to getting his signature after pursuing him back to Downpatrick, although it was later learned that Newcastle too badly wanted to bring him on board.Local sports writer Charlie McStay recalled being contacted in later years by one of the Newcastle coaches who was enquiring about what had happened to Jim. ldquoNewcastle knew they had a gem on their hands, but he slipped through the net.All the coaches rated him at the highest level and believed he would have gone on to become a true star of English football, said Charlie.What a journey that would have been. All the way from Dunleath City and Santos in the Downpatrick Youth League to the pinnacle of professional soccer.Although soccer was Jimrsquos first love, he was an accomplished boxer and in his early days was trained by Owen Kerr, a respected coach who was a friend of world heavyweight champion, Floyd Patterson. Coincidentally, Owen was uncle to Cathal Kerr, who married Jimrsquos sister Bronagh. Small world!Jim also played juvenile and senior football for the Downpatrick Russell Gaelic Union, which this week remembered him as ldquomore than just a great footballer.An online RGU statement said: ldquoHe was one of the nicest guys you could ever meet. A true gentleman with an infectious laugh, he will be sadly missed by all who knew him.Away from sport, Jim trained as a mechanic and later became a minibus driver at Knockevin School and the local hospitals. He then joined Ulsterbus as a driver at the Downpatrick depot and rounded off his career as a groundsman at the Delamont estate. Always active, alwaysbusy that was the Jim Connolly way.Throughout his le, Jimrsquos singular passion was his family and friends. He was devoted to his we Angela mdash the couple were together from their teenage days and were rarely seen apart mdash and to his children, Aurla, Blaine and Clare. Nothing brought him greater happiness also than the birth of his grandchildren, Ruby, Darcy, Fianna, Fiachra, Grace and Eve. He is also survived by brothers Pat and Martin, sisters Ann, Marie, Bronagh, and Eilish, by his father-in-law Paddy Teggart, and by sons-in-law Feargal and Jude and his daughter-in-law Megan.Theirs is not a private grief. It is shared by countless hundreds who remember the boy and man who gave so much pleasure and for whom there is always a place in their hearts.Joe McCoubrey.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Job.jpg","title":"JobStart scheme to help young people welcomed by MLA  ","story":"THE launch of a new government scheme designed to create job opportunities for young people has been welcomed by local politicians.Department for Communities minister Deirdre Hargey last week launched the poundm JobStart scheme designed to support - year olds facing additional employment challenges due to the impact of Covid-.In addition, the government department has also helped create additional employment opportunities for young people and remove barriers for those seeking employment through the work experience programme and an expanded adviser discretionary fund.Minister Hargey said the Covid- pandemic has had an ldquounprecedented impact on the local economy and labour market and that as part of her departmentrsquos response, it has addressed the anticipated impacts on young people and those who are ready to be re-employed but need help negotiating the process of finding work.ldquoThis has included creating job opportunities and placements for young people providing additional payments towards travel or childcare expenses financial support of up to pound, a year to assist in the removal of barriers to employment and training to help people increase their chances of gaining employment.The JobStart scheme is designed to create opportunities for - year olds by providing positions with employers for a period of six months, increasing to nine months for those who meet additional criteria.An Opportunity Guarantee strand has been added to The Work Experience Programmefeaturing  week placements with the guarantee of an interview for a job or an apprenticeship on completion.Strangford MLA Kellie Armstrong and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran have both welcomed the new scheme.Mrs Armstrong said the scheme was originally due to start last year, arguing that many young people may have missed out as a result of its delayed implementation.She continued: ldquoThe roll-out of this scheme is welcome as it will help young people climb back from the pandemic financially, while giving the economy a boost. I encourage them to apply for it.ldquoHowever, it is frustrating it has taken us so long to get to this stage. The rest of the UK benefited from it [the scheme] while Northern Ireland lagged behind which was unacceptable. Something which would be so useful can only lose value as time moves on.The MLA said that during the height of lockdown, people under  were the most impacted in terms of job losses and went from ldquoexpecting a scheme to wonderingone would appear at all, confirming that she has asked for confirmation that the Department for Communities will ensure opportunities from the JobStart scheme will be made available across Northern Ireland and will not just be concentrated around Belfast.Cllr Curran said with lockdown restrictions continuing to ease, any move to create job opportunities for young people is particularly welcome as they have a key role to play in future economic success.ldquoMany young people have bore the brunt of an unparalleled economic situation which has had a massive impact on the provincersquos economy, he continued.ldquoRebuilding the economy will require access to highly skilled and talented young iniduals to enable employers to compete globally and young people, in particular, need to be able to avail of high quality routes into careers.Cllr Curran also highlighted the importance of apprenticeship schemes to assist with economic recovery, and, looking forward, believes it is vital that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has access to highly skilled employers as businesses work to recover from the devastating impact of coronavirus.He said he firmly believes that the enterprise, innovation and entrepreneurship of young people is crucial to the economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Athletics.jpg","title":"Lady luck for East Down AC runners  ","story":"THE  Belfast Half Marathon was always going to be a virtual affair due to Covid- restrictions, but that didnrsquot seem to put people off entering and setting their own route in order to chase a personal best for the distance or simply to claim their T-shirt.This event is normally well attended and attracts a raft of spectators, which creates a great atmosphere, but this year it was up to the runners to come up with a way of motivating themselves on the day.East Down AC had several runners who have used this as their incentive to keep churning out the long runs and as the date approached they were well prepared to cover the . miles.It was a case of girl power as all the EDAC athletes who took part were female on this occasion. Joanne Carson is credited with coming up with a pleasing route for her buddies, Helen Vint, Mags Flynn and Cathy Burke.These girls are to be seen most weekends, rain, hail or shine, chalking up miles in and around Downpatrick. Their dedication is most commendable. In their opinion, a half marathon is long enough to challenge the legs but not as draining as a full marathon so you could almost say that it is an enjoyable task.Joanne got them off to a familiar start. They met outside Castlewellan Forest Park on Saturday morning and ran into the park to do three laps of the lake. Nicely warmed up, they then headed out the main road to Newcastle and didnrsquot stop till they were in the grounds of the Slieve Donard hotel.They fairly breezed along and were all within sight of each other as they came to a halt. Cathy andMags were at the head of the pack in one hour  minutes with Helen less than a minute behind.Joanne was just a few seconds over the two hours and more than happy with her run and they all agreed that it was a scenic route.Being at the Percy French and the fact that outside hospitality had conveniently opened the night before, it would have been rude not to have an ice cold beverage to celebrate. Well deserved ladies.And so to Sunday, Suzy Smith often meets with friends and family including Kelly her niece for a long Sunday run.They stay close to home in Ballykinlar where the terrain could be described as lumpy. In fact whichever way they go, there are some challenging hills but these girls are well used to it and tough enough to persevere.Suzy had actually only planned to run a few miles with brother Patrick to encourage him on his way to the half marathon distance but she was enjoying it so much that she ran on and on until before she knew it, she had covered the entire . miles.Despite this only being her second time to complete a half marathon, she finished in a very respectable time of two hours and five minutes.Who knows how well she could doshe was participating in an official race Kelly meanwhile had struck a brisk pace from the off and followed her own rhythm easing ahead in the early stages. She has been running very well in training and it was no surprise that despite the gradients involved, she ended up with a personal best time of one hour  minutes.Again there is no doubt on a flatter course with other runners to chase, there will be improvement to come but for now both Smiths were content with their efforts and so they should be, well done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7May2021-Leader.jpg","title":"Leader and inspiration  ","story":"FINNEBROGUE Artisan has promised to continue the legacy of founding chairman Denis Lynn who died in a quad bike accident at the weekend.Hailed as an ldquoinnovator and visionary, Mr Lynn died following a tragic incident at his home in Killyleagh on Sunday.Mr Lynnbecame synonymous with his Downpatrick-based firm, which now employs , people over four local sites.On buying Finnebrogue Estate on the outskirts of the town in , the former potato chip seller turned to beef and deer farming and established Finnebrogue as the biggest venison processor and supplier in the UK.He then produced quality sausages, supplying Marks and Spencer and other leading retailers, and developed the nitrate-free bacon brand, Naked Bacon, in .More recently, Finnebrogue has ersied into developing meat-free products.The firmrsquos senior management team will now lead the business with non-executive director David Manning stepping up as interim-chairman and non-executive director Colin Walsh as interim deputy-chairman.A company statement paid tribute to Mr Lynn, who is survived by his we Christine, daughters Kerry, Clare, Tara and Ciara, and his wider family circle.It said: ldquoDenis was an innovator and a visionary with an infectious passion for delivering positive change for the planet and its people.

Disposable barbecues are bad for the environment in terms of use and disposal, said the resident.ldquoThese barbecues are made using unsustainable materials from tropical forests in South Africa and South America.ldquoThey canrsquot be recycled, burn grass and typically result in scattered litter. Just like Chinese sky lanterns which the local council previously took action on and which were also once acceptable, the time has come to ban disposable barbecues.The resident said disposable barbecues represent a ldquohuge fire risk, burn the ground underneath them, are often left as litter and contain sharp pieces that can harm animalstrodden on.She added: ldquoThey are used in beauty spots, wildle reserves and on beaches and are just left smouldering.

This is what led to a conversation with Cathy, who had a shared love and passion for the sport, she continued.ldquoWe both agreed it would be amazingwe could bring young girls together to play camogie. The success of St. Kevinrsquos would not have been possible without the drive from both parishes.The newly formed committee is made up of a number of associated members from both clubs, who all share the same common goal of teaching camogie to as many girls as possible whilst ensuring a longevity to develop and establish the club.Cathy said it was ldquoan absolute honour to play a part in the creation of St Kevinrsquos.ldquoAs a Drumaness Gael I know that a very special lady, Annie Gelston, a Drumaness camogie legend, will be looking down with pride, said Mason.ldquoI would like to say a special word of thanks to the Drumaness and Teconnaught clubs for their unwavering support over the past few weeks, not only in the initial set-up but also with use of their pitches and facilities.The club held their first training session together at the Teconnaught club grounds on Saturday and it was evident that there is a potential successful future ahead based on the turnout of participants.ldquoTherersquos not many times in my le Irsquove been lost for words, but describing my emotions and feelings of Saturday is definitely one of them, said Maria.ldquoWe had over  girls show up for our first training session, over  in our senior ladies and U- session and over  in our sessions for the younger girls, she added.Cathy also reflected on the historic first training session, describing it as a ldquospecial moment as she watched the ldquomany smiles on the faces of the young children having fun and hopefully falling in love with the wonderful sport of camogie.Since many of the girls in all of the age groups had never attended a camogie training session before, the highly experienced coaches, who have backgrounds in both hurling and camogie, began teaching the basics to get them familiar with holding a hurley and making contact with the sliotar.Several dferent training drills were also incorporated to get the new recruits comfortable on the pitch.ldquoIt is very important to me and the coaches that we made this past Saturday and all future sessions a positive experience for the girls, said Maria.ldquoSo many of them took to it so naturally and we canrsquot wait to see how they progress over the season.St Kevinrsquos now eagerly look ahead to their first match against Ballela on May ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12578012.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Please try again later.Submitting...I remember this well because it was one of the first major in-depth news reports that I covered as a then relatively novice reporter.The investigation related to Paragraph  of those talks.The web version of this article will include the full wording of that paragraph, which said that the Irish and British governments “recognise that there is an issue to be addressed, with the completion of the early release scheme, about supporters of organisations now on cease-fire against whom there are outstanding prosecutions, and in some cases extradition proceedings, for offences committed before  April ”It went on to say that such people would,convicted, benefit from early release under the Belfast Agreement and “would be a natural development of the scheme for such prosecutions not to be pursued”• See below for full wording of paragraph This was not said to be a general amnesty but rather to relate to people who have been charged but not convicted of an offence, such as those who have jumped bail before or during trial. However, there was concern that the paragraph had been vaguely worded to placate Sinn Fein and would provide a future basis for an amnesty for all terror offences committed pre .It raised the notion that for the first time the UK was conceding that suspects would not necessarily have to answer terrorist charges against them. “We are in the realms of legal revolution,” Austen Morgan, an expert in constitutional law, told me. “We would normally leave these matters to the DPP.”Stephen Farry, then the Alliance Party’s justice spokesman, said: “Until now, it has always been the policy of the governments to regard terrorist activities as criminal offences, albeit politically-motivated ones. This proposal risks giving the impression that actions of republican and loyalist paramilitaries were legitimate.” Dr Farry expressed surprise that other political parties had been relatively quiet over the proposals, believing that the implications of the clause had been underestimated. “In every prosecution you are making a general point as well as particular point,You are saying these things are wrong.”In the end the paragraph never came to pass, due to delays in paramilitary decommissioning.Stormont would in fact fall over such disagreements the next year, and the amnesty proposal of  would also come to nothing.We now know that Tony Blair went on to instigate a secret scheme for On The Runs including Letters of Comfort and even Royal Pardons.You could say that the UK has been determined to end prosecutions for exactly  years.But in fact there has been an informal amnesty since . After all, how feasible was it that Martin McGuinness would be made deputy first minister — a position which, Sinn Fein love to point out, is in effect joint first minister — and then arrested and made to face a criminal trial followed by a jail term His funeral was attended by a host of dignitaries from President Bill Clinton to the first minister Arlene Foster to the chief prosecutor to the head of the PSNI and others.In  the ex RUC assistant chief constable Alan McQuillan wrote on these pages that future legacy crime investigators might face “political pressure, not least from the two governments, not to pursue those whose arrest might ‘destabilise the peace process’”.Yet while no IRA leader has ever faced charges commensurate with their decades of pre meditated murder and mayhem, several soldiers face homicide trials for single shootings.I see real problems with this reported UK plan on prosecutions. But I do not blame them for seeking radical solutions to the scandal of how legacy is panning out.• Paragraph  of the  Weston Park talks document: “Both Governments also recognise that there is an issue to be addressed, with the completion of the early release scheme, about supporters of organisations now on cease-fire against whom there are outstanding prosecutions, and in some cases extradition proceedings, for offences committed before  April . Such people would,convicted, stand to benefit from the early release scheme. The Governments accept that it would be a natural development of the scheme for such prosecutions not to be pursued and will as soon as possible, and in any event before the end of the year, take such steps as are necessary in their jurisdictions to resolve this dficulty so that those concerned are no longer pursued.”• Ben Lowry is News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: Let us hope that the brilliant Eoghan Harris keeps on writingOther articles by Ben Lowry below, and beneath that information on how to subscribe to the News Letter:• Ben Lowry May : Unionism can’t just be about managing long-term defeat• Ben Lowry May : Arlene Foster was given huge opportunity by DUP after her exit helped ruin UUP• Ben Lowry April : NI seems to rely increasingly on just one pollster for data on attitudes to a border poll• Ben Lowry April : DUP still has to choose between managing this disaster or total rejection of it• Ben Lowry April : His enduring marriage to the Queen was key to our understanding of Prince Philip• Ben Lowry April : Radio grilling of UUP leader exposed folly of unionists blaming Simon Byrne for funeral• Ben Lowry Mar : There should not be an Irish language act, but it is too late — the DUP has agreed one• Ben Lowry Mar : We have made it through the worst of the dark, dreaded winter lockdown• Ben Lowry Mar : MLAs lost control of abortion by rejecting modest law reform• Ben Lowry Mar : Whatever future Boris Johnson adopts for Northern Ireland seems set to lead to a crisis• Ben Lowry Mar : Scotland tunnel isn’t fantasy, but something kids of today might see• Ben Lowry Mar :  The cost of victims’ pension has ballooned without explanation as to why \u2029• Ben Lowry Feb : Unionists have fully turned against Irish Sea border because they’ve seen the scale of disaster• Ben Lowry Feb : We still lack answers as to why IRA funeral got special treatment at Roselawn• Ben Lowry Feb : Peter Robinson has long experience of what is and is not politically feasible• Ben Lowry Feb : There is barely any unionist support for violence, despite justied anger at sea border• Ben Lowry Jan : At last, clear reason for UK and unionists to stop being weak towards Ireland EU• Ben Lowry Jan : Lockdown sceptics have been undermined by crazy theories, but sensible criticisms haven’t gone away• Ben Lowry Jan : The Irish Sea border was imposed because UK knew unionists would take it• Ben Lowry in : Last night unionists celebrated a move towards Irish unity——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Who remembers the haloed vision of Dianne Weist as Pegg Boggs, the Avon lady in Edward Scissorhands, with the aforementioned pillarbox hat, pale violet dress suit, and kindly demeanour, assured that one of the cosmetic line’s weird potions may even remedy humanoid Edward’s deathly pallor     \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Today there are .m representatives world wide, with the company making an estimated annual revenue of £.bn.“The mission of the company is to empower women,” says the CEO of Avon, Andrea Jung. “The business may have been started by a man, but in the s it was an unpopular thing to give women the opportunity to earn outside the home. It’s about giving women earning opportunities.” Avon spokeswoman, Hollywood actress Reese Witherspoon, is just one of the celebritieswho has helped combat the brand’s occasionally mumsy, bargain basement image, and fundraised for their female-focused causes – such as breast cancer and domestic violence.Avon looks set to be calling at many more UK homes, after the cosmetics company revealed in July that the number of people signing up to be sales representatives had more than doubled under lockdown.The company said it had seen a % “surge” in the number of new representatives joining its UK business since lockdown began.So despite the qauint image of the preened Avon lady of old, it looks like the company has new cachet, an ever growing number of willing women armed with their catalogues and lipsticks, ready to take on the world.Every woman knows that beauty is a weapon, le is a battle and the right lippie can make you feel set to make men fall at your feet en route to world domination.The Avon lady is like a feminist warrior, bonding with women over cosmetics, generating debate and empowering women to look, feel and live better.  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularBody of newborn baby found in canalMotorists warned about ‘severe traffic congestion’ near NI airportJohn O’Dowd’s bogus comparison of Northern Ireland and South Africa suggests he has no experience of apartheidEmotional petition launched to save ‘a place of fun and laughter which created many happy memories’ - ‘our own wee Disney world’Evidence-gathering operation carried out at Antrim protest against NI protocol - warnings issued to participants - letter demanding resignation of Chief Constable Simon Byrne delivered to PSNI stationMost PopularSam McBride: Is stolen Northern Bank cash in politics  Alarmingly, no one seems botheredSam McBride: Don’t assume Edwin Poots is more hardline than Sir Jeffrey Donaldson – the truth is more nuancedBen Lowry: Let us hope that the brilliant Eoghan Harris keeps on writingCall for action after sick threats made to NI journalist’s childNorthern Ireland Centenary rose proves a thorn in the side for Sinn Fein                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\" ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kafWEX sc-feJyhm dbjzDR\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommendedPublic NoticesFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Nisha said the -year-old, who had worked in travel and tourism and lived in Bahrain, recently retired and moved back home to live in Bangalore in southern India.Sadly, he contracted coronavirus in March and was hospitalised. Dr Satyavir SinghalSpeaking from her home in south Belfast, Nisha said: “The care in the ICU wasn’t the care which one would have expected.- even in the private hospitals.”She said her sister had paid a “phenomenal amount of money” for his treatment, but added, “nothing could save him.”“It was a terrible situation. The poor girlhad to go through hell. “Even to get the death certicate and to get the paperwork sorted out has been a nightmare for her. “The funeral she had to do all by herself - there was nobody there.”Nisha Tandon is the founder and director of award-winning ethnic arts organisation, ArtsEkta and the creative force behind the Belfast Mela: an international showcase of music, dance, art, and food from more than  nations around the globe, held every summer in Belfast’s Botanic Gardens. She was also the driving force behind the development of the Indian Community Centre in Belfast and in  was awarded an OBE for services to the minority sector. Originally from New Delhi, she came to Northern Ireland in  as a young bride in an arranged marriage to Vijay, whose family first settled here in the s.Nisha said watching the television coverage of the pandemic sweep her native home is “just heartbreaking.”“Being so far away you cannot really do anything. The only support you can give is moral support by a phone call or by emails or video calls.“My entire family is in India. I am the only one who is here from my maternal side. From my father’s side I have cousins who are living in Birmingham.“It is very scary. We keep in touch with every single member of the family the older generation, we need to really worry about. There are so many cousins who are isolating and my aunties and uncles are isolating. “It is a dire situation and the aftermath is going to be even worse than it is now. There are going to be a lot of children who will be left with no parents and a lot of fathers will be left with no sons and a lot of sons will be left with no fathers. Especially in the very remote villages where it has reached and obviously in cities you can see what is happening they are showing it on every single news.“People are helpless - we saw it here and our hearts broke, while our systems here are much more robust. When you see the systems over thereyour heart breaks.”Nisha added there have been a lot of deaths in the Indian community in Northern Ireland due to Covid, but these have not been widely reported on. ArtsEkta has teamed up with the Isha Foundation to help raise funds for the devastating impact of Covid  in India. “It is a really, really bad situation in India and we have started to do a little bit of fundraising. “Whatever anyone can give, every little will help. It will go to the people who need support. Robin Swann has been really good sending three containers of oxygen from NI, but then remember India was also sending vaccinations to Northern Ireland and other parts of the UK.” To donate visit:️ https:www.totalgiving ... Isha-Europe-Corona-ReliefSusan Gillenlives in Jordanstown and tries to avoid watching television coverage of the pandemic in India.“It is so distressing, it’s like a horror film,” she said. Susan’s anguish is compounded by the fact her -year-old father, Dr John Mathai, is currently “trapped” in Kerala. “My father was a consultant geriatrician in Northern Ireland for many years and when he retired in  he went to live in London. “The whole year of isolation in London made him decide he would go to India for the winter. He left in November and he was due to come back on St Patrick’s Day, but because of his age he didn’t feel he would survive the quarantine when he ed to London, so he decided to stay on in India. “Obviously he wants to come back, but who knows when that is going to happen now with India on the red list for travel. We can’t get out to visit there, which is frustrating and upsetting. What can you do from so far away ”Susan FaceTimes her father quite often and said he is “quite calm and collected” about the situation.“He’s also quite circumspect about not travelling around or meeting too many people - he’s sensible. He’s not in a high state of fright or distress, but he’s very upset watching the other states, like the Punjab, which are in a really terrible way.”The Mathai family have many relatives in the state of Kerala, but Susan said thankfully none of them has died or become very unwell from Covid. “There are a lot of cases in Kerala at the moment, but they seem to have enough oxygen supplies and were better prepared than a lot of other states.”But, she believes the crisis across India has been “terribly mismanaged”.“Indian weddings, religious festivals involving huge gatherings and raucous election rallies involving crowds were all permitted to take place just before the second wave There doesn’t seem to have been measures put in place in the event of a second wave - the feeling was that they had survived the first one, so it didn’t seem to have been a big priority for the governments,”She added:“India was producing vaccines for the whole world and now it’s an embarrassing situation where they are having to rely on foreign aid to pull them out of this hole which they didn’t really have to be inthey had been prepared.”Dr Satyavir Singhal BEM, a consultant anaesthetist with the Belfast Trust, moved from Delhi to Northern Ireland  years ago. Now living in Newtownabbey, he has been watching the coverage of the horric devastation Covid- is causing in his homeland and, naturally, worries about his relatives there. “Sitting here you feel absolutely heartbroken and helpless. There is not a single member of the family who has been spared. Two who were caught in the pandemic, one from my we’s side, her brother’s we - they couldn’t get a hospital bed, but we could buy an oxygen concentrator for her and medication, so she survived and she is out of the woods now.”Dr Singhal said the oxygen concentrator he bought for his sister-in-law would normally cost about £-, but he paid £,, because of a shortage. “My sister’s husband is still in the hospital and my classmate lost both his parents a day apart.”Dr Singhal said he and colleagues in Northern Ireland are liaising with the medical fraternity in India. “They are still learning and hopefully we can guide them in terms of our experience of treatments or in terms of finding a hospital bed.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityVale of Glamorgan council put forward Aberthaw, a recently closed coal-fired power plant, as a potential site for a fusion prototype.The UK government last year called for suggestions for possible sites to pioneer the technology which could generate electricity with low carbon emissions.But opposition councillors on the Vale council have claimed the cabinet has ldquorushed through its decision to suggest Aberthaw as a site.More NewsCardf Tomasz Waga murder investigation sees two more arrestedFour coffee shops in Penarth for meeting a friend outdoorsThings to do in South Wales on May Bank Holiday weekend Plaid Councillor Ian Johnson said: ldquoIt was strange that the council leadership did not consult with other parties or ask a cross-party scrutiny committee to consider issues before making the expression of interest about a possible future use of the Aberthaw plant.ldquoEven though it is an early point, many people will have questions about the technology, the impact of the development and the process, and discussing this in scrutiny would open up the debate and ensure transparency.Fusion technology is still in its infancy and no fusion reactor has ever created more power than it consumes. But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
