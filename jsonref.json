They also act as a secondary market to value loans already advanced, which is reflected in the yield.At the outset of the Covid-19 outbreak, bond markets froze as investors panic bought highly rated government bonds and the number of sellers shrank.The US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the European Central bank, which oversee the largest debt markets, stepped in to expand the number of bonds on offer and promised to meet demand while the crisis continued.Demand has been supported by the Bank of England’s pledge to “create” £200bn of electronic funds to purchase more bonds as part of its quantitative easing programme, adding to the £435bn of assets on its balance sheet.Paul Donovan, the chief economist at UBS Wealth Management, said the UK was in a strong position to maintain its fundraising to meet extra spending.“The UK is still a large market for bonds and sterling is still a reserve currency behind the dollar and the euro. And the UK is not different to any other country in needing extra funds to support extra spending. It is not an outlier,” he said.“The UK response to the coronavirus outbreak is arguably more coherent than many other countries, making it attractive to investors,” he said.Government borrowing this year could increase by up to three times, to £175bn, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, though the figure depends on the length of the current lockdown and the extent of the damage to the economy.The sharp economic downturn, which economists say could be the worst since the second world war, will also add to borrowing as tax receipts plunge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3761bc0494cd2c9a6cc566b031e8a6c81ff12447/0_67_3443_2066/master/3443.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2f859395d0e800d1aaf3772d339c0a8","title":"coronavirus government prime minister power","story":"Beyond this private and very understandable distress lies a grave new political realityOnce in a generation – and only then if it’s unlucky – a nation finds itself living through events so dramatic they almost defy belief.Not Boris Johnson, surely. Not that most bouncy and irrepressible of men, who always seemed the definition of a lucky general. While we know this virus does not discriminate, there is still something faintly surreal about the idea of the prime minister lying in intensive care, his own body now a battlefield for the virus that has come to define his fledgling premiership.Don’t underestimate how many ordinary people will be shaken by the sight of a 55-year-old laid low like this, despite the best care the NHS has to offer. So many lives have already been touched by this virus in ways we could never have imagined three months ago and now, by a terrible irony, the man responsible for leading us through it is one of them.Whose heart does not go out out to a heavily pregnant Carrie Symonds, weeks away from giving birth to their baby? The wider Johnson family, too, deserve to feel supported in their distress, like any other family waiting for news from hospital. Yet beyond this private and very understandable distress lies a grave new political reality. Just as the epidemic nears its dangerous peak, a hole is emerging at the heart of government.It no longer feels like a coincidence that the Queen was finally deployed on Sunday night, just as Johnson was heading for hospital. Her address to the nation was a gentle reminder that in Britain power does not rest solely in one place, yet in practice there is only so much she can do to steady a ship now heading for constitutionally uncharted waters.Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has been asked to deputise for Johnson, yet that official language conceals a very grey area. Unlike America, Britain has no designated survivor to step up in an emergency. Constitutionally speaking, there is no such thing as an acting prime minister either there are only prime ministers, who serve until they lose an election, resign or die, and in their absence power devolves to the cabinet as a whole.Raab’s new status is essentially a means of preventing the chain of command from becoming confused or mired in internecine cabinet rivalries, although it remains to be seen whether he really has the authority to knock his colleagues’ heads together. (Those who wonder why it’s him in charge rather than the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, now self-isolating after a family member showed coronavirus symptoms, perhaps miss the point that Johnson was nominating not a successor but a caretaker.)For now, the opposition seems willing to give all this the benefit of the doubt. Illness transforms the prime minister in the public mind, to the extent that it would seem grotesque for Labour to use this moment for political advantage. Nor can Keir Starmer do anything that might be interpreted as pressuring a sick man back to work we’ll never know whether Johnson would have got this ill if he’d rested the minute he was diagnosed, but a culture in which politicians don’t feel able to take sick leave even on their hospital beds is in no sense a healthy one.Yet it remains the opposition’s job to hold government accountable for management of this epidemic, and if Johnson’s absence turns out to be prolonged, questions will eventually have to be asked about the democratic basis on which his chosen substitutes continue to govern.The cruelty of this situation is that it pits the human imperative to be kind, to make allowances for awful circumstances, against the remorseless political imperatives of a crisis in which many more lives are at stake.For there are life-changing judgment calls to be made over the coming weeks, as Downing Street grapples not only with clinical questions about when and how to lift the lockdown, but with an economic crisis unfolding alongside it at pace. It no longer seems credible that we will simply pick up where we left off pre-virus, and huge decisions loom about how to restart a hollowed-out economy and how the bills now being racked up will be repaid. With all due respect to Raab, there is only so far a stand-in can go in taking decisions which will determine what kind of society emerges from this.What exacerbates the problem is that the country didn’t just vote for a Conservative government last December, or even for a slate of policies. It voted, perhaps more than usual, given the degree of switching across party lines, for one man and one idea. Johnson embodies not so much an ideology as a mood, a feeling, a sense of what Britain could be that was inextricably bound up with (but not wholly limited to) Brexit.Whether his brand of breezy confidence suits the management of an epidemic is not, perhaps, a question to be asked over his hospital bed. But it’s hard to see anyone else in government occupying quite the place he did in the public imagination, should his absence extend for more than a few weeks.Clearly it’s to be hoped the prime minister makes a swift and full recovery. But nobody bounces straight back from intensive care into 18-hour days at the office, which suggests at best he will need time to convalesce. Downing Street may need to start preparing the public soon for the possibility of a long, slow road back to normality.Power instinctively fears a vacuum, because of the risk that it will fill with panic. The suspicion at Westminster for days now has been that No 10 was playing down the seriousness of the prime minister’s illness in order to keep the nation calm, a suspicion only reinforced by a curiously strained Monday night press conference in which Raab insisted the boss was still overseeing things from his hospital bed while admitting that he hadn’t actually spoken to him since Saturday.Within hours, it emerged that the prime minister was in fact heading to intensive care. Sudden deterioration is an emerging hallmark of coronavirus cases, so it is not impossible that his office was as taken aback as anyone else by this decline. But from here on in, candour is essential.These are extraordinary times, which means voters may well accept extraordinary solutions for a while to allow the prime minister a chance to heal. But we cannot live for ever in a state of democratic ambiguity, and if the road to recovery proves longer or harder than expected, there may come a time when Johnson faces a very personal choice between the job he has craved all his life and the national interest. Downing Street cannot be alone in hoping it doesn’t come to that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaea08743184ef4b51cc2d8897ba651ff4d92a1d/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e91cbe6d91b6a946e36efac75b00dac4","title":"life never return normal coronavirus shape generation","story":"I have studied the psychological effects of pandemics – and even a few weeks of isolation can cause lasting anxiety• See all our coronavirus coverageI knew a pandemic was coming, but I didn’t think it would be so soon. In the weeks before the outbreak of Covid-19 began in Wuhan, I was putting the finishing touches to a book about the psychology of pandemics. In my work as a clinical psychologist, I had spent years studying past outbreaks and examining what they could teach us about the psychological effects of the next virus.Based on the hallmarks of previous pandemics, some of my predictions about coronavirus have proved eerily correct. I imagined that we’d see growing anxiety, racism, panic-buying, the proliferation of conspiracy theories, and sporadic instances of looting and theft – but also altruism and generosity, as people reached out to the physically isolated with offers of help.Previous outbreaks, such as the 2009 influenza pandemic and the 2003 Sars epidemic, suggest that a public health emergency can have lasting effects on the psychology of a population. In the case of Covid-19, some of these effects are obvious: many people will lose their jobs and endure financial hardship others will suffer the devastation of losing loved ones marriages and relationships will collapse under the pressure of lockdown.It’s likely that even those who aren’t infected with coronavirus could also develop psychological symptoms. Isolation and confinement, even if only for a few weeks, can cause lasting anxiety. People quarantined for prolonged periods in cramped accommodation, sharing a bedroom with multiple occupants, or trapped at home in an abusive or coercive relationship, may be especially vulnerable to developing PTSD symptoms during and after the outbreak.Other psychological effects will have more to do with environmental and social changes. Covid-19 has forced societies to trial entirely new ways of living. School lessons have moved online work meetings take place over Zoom groceries are delivered via Amazon. We’re living through the first global pandemic in the digital age, where the internet has made it possible to withdraw from the outside world.Even before the outbreak, people were already working from home, shopping online, and having food delivered, rather than going to restaurants. The outbreak may have further entrenched the direction in which society was already heading. After coronavirus has passed, we may find that life never fully returns to “normal”. Risk-averse, digitally connected people could continue retreating to the safety of home.As a result of Covid-19, some people will become fastidious germophobes, striving to avoid touching “contaminated” surfaces or shaking hands. Germ phobias, which are typically symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorders, arise from a combination of genetic and environmental factors that interact with one another. In other words, when a person with a particular genetic makeup has a traumatic experience with infections (such as developing a severe case of Covid-19), they are likely to develop a germ phobia. Such phobias are typically chronic, although milder phobias may be short-lived.Still, there is some cause for optimism. The many people who volunteered to help others during the pandemic will experience renewed purpose and meaning in their lives. And those who adjusted better to self-isolation – that is, people who are open to new experiences, optimistic and emotionally stable – are more likely to fare well during and after the pandemic. Not everyone possesses these characteristics, but people can improve their resilience by learning new coping strategies, through practices like cognitive behavioural therapy (a valuable resource for this is the BounceBack programme, which is freely available online).The future implications of coronavirus are still uncertain. But based on what we know from previous outbreaks, we can predict that this pandemic will have profound psychological effects on the people living through it.• Steven Taylor is a professor and clinical psychologist in the department of psychiatry, University of British Columbia, and the author of The Psychology of Pandemics "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1c8906f5d9b2f86ba238ff252172833cb660755/124_139_3191_1914/master/3191..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cd21d7758d944074eddbf03d6cb66c9","title":"value key workers low pay","story":"If those who care for us are to be first, not last, we have to look at the conditions that drive wage stagnation and insecurityThis weekend brought the news that two workers at London’s Pentonville prison, Bovil Peter and Patrick Beckford, had died with symptoms of Covid-19. “Symptoms” is nowadays a euphemism for “they weren’t tested”, and a grim reminder of the hundreds of thousands of key workers we are asking the world of, but whose selflessness is not being reciprocated.These are tragedies laced with guilt for all of us: plainly, the most dangerous place to be during this epidemic is in a densely populated care environment, whether a hospital, school or prison. People work in them because they have a passion, but also because there is no alternative, and they do so on all our behalves.Prison officers have always been the unsung heroes of public duty: never quite macho enough for the people who glorify the armed forces always a bit too authoritarian for those who valorise nurses. They are some of the most inventive and diligent people working anywhere in the business of caring for others, but they have generally done so without much credit.This crisis is forcing an urgent re-evaluation of that, along with all those other jobs that were previously classed as low-value yet now turn out to be the most important in the country. Words are not enough, and nor is clapping you can praise care workers to the skies, but if you’re paying them the minimum amount in 15-minute segments, without security of hours or of employment, without sick or holiday pay, then the praise is hollow.You can wax sentimental about the holy vocation of nursing, but you cannot then bring second-year students on to the frontline to fight coronavirus and still expect them to pay their tuition fees. You cannot claim, as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, told Andrew Marr on Sunday, that this isn’t the right time to talk about pay rises it is the best and only time to talk about pay rises, when we have finally realised, with a jolt, just how much we rely on people who put their jobs ahead of their own safety.Yet this is about more than money: Keir Starmer accepted the Labour leadership on Saturday with the rousing Old Testament statement about all key workers, cleaners, paramedics, carers, porters: “For too long they’ve been taken for granted and poorly paid. They were last and now they should be first.” But what would it actually mean to put these jobs first? Money is some of the answer, but we also have to look at the conditions and assumptions that drive wage stagnation and the steady erosion of security.There is nothing radical in the observation that jobs are often described as low-skill, when actually they are just poorly paid. More radical, yet still accurate, is the assertion that they are characterised as “low-skill” deliberately. Caring is a job of tremendous skill, hard as well as soft. And while there is a huge amount of bolt-on expertise that employers require, from administering medicines to dealing with dementia, this is not reflected in any career progression. It is not unusual for a carer in her 40s to be on the same hourly rate, adjusted for inflation, that she was on at 18.This has been systematic, not accidental. Without progression, the wage bill can remain reliably static, which is the only way the financial architecture of the sector makes sense.There is often better progression in public sector work, but the combination of the austerity-years pay freeze and a new normal (extending even to the police) of people at the start of their career being expected to work voluntarily, which itself erodes starting salaries, has had a striking effect on these jobs.Ironically, Theresa May was right when she famously said that a nurse might use a food bank for “complicated reasons”. Of course there’s a very simple reason – that nurse is not being paid enough. But the feedback loop between the private and public sectors – low pay, insecurity and poor conditions legitimised in one sector and migrating to another – is actually quite complicated.And there’s an overarching fallacy, that a job many people could do must be inherently low in value. By these lights, huge numbers of people – cleaners, drivers, shop assistants – are without prospects, being so replaceable. The times are testing this assumption to destruction – when you’re looking for the people whose courage we need in order for civilisation to survive, you don’t have to look much further than the postal worker or the hospital porter.In the immediate term, putting key workers first means personal protective equipment it means collective and determined effort to strip as much risk as possible out of essential jobs that simply wouldn’t get done if everyone looked out for themselves. But there will be an era after coronavirus and one thing to carry into it will be a determination never again to think, talk about or treat people as though logic demands they should be screwed down to their lowest possible price."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83ceb7fdd3481024fc62f0e00ada854cdf43b6f1/0_0_3058_1861/master/3058.jpg?width=685\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9c6e742273abd82606bfd63d8a5ca2e 685w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of vivid","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘vivid’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘vivid’.Share your photos of what vivid means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 8 April at 10am.

(All fun and games until you accidentally put your finger over the camera seven times in a minute.)I had been trying to wean myself off Twitter before the crisis, but Alistair Green’s skits keep pulling me back to it. He’s a comedian who is insanely good at social media, and who specialises in Limmy-ish, David Brent-esque visions of terrible middle-Englanders. His coronavirus content has been particularly impressive, offering light relief by sending up prejudice and delving into farce. Highlights include a woman whose husband won’t eat Chinese food any more, though carbonara is fine a mock press conference where the PM zones out to think about hot buttery toast and parental video call fails, all filmed solo and fuss-free in Green’s living room.After briefly trying to get into TikTok – which I have decided is mostly just videos of footballers I’ve not heard of doing viral dance challenges – I’m back with everyone else over the age of 14 on YouTube. In particular, the Bon Appétit Test Kitchen has reeled me in. The US food magazine’s content seems to have become A Thing in the past year, but I’d never really got it. I love cooking, I read cookbooks when I’m bored, and Nigel Slater’s programmes are among the only shows I can rewatch endlessly, but did I need to get into a cultish online cookery channel, too?The answer was yes, especially when you’ve got strands such as It’s Alive, in which lovely, laid-back Brad ferments things – perfect for our own new normal, where making your own mustard is a great way to kill a few hours – or Reverse Engineering, in which perfectly uptight Chris tweaks and retweaks recipes in order to replicate a mystery dish. Then there’s upscale junk-food queen Claire’s Gourmet Makes, featuring something called pizza rolls that got slightly lost in translation.Bon Appétit isn’t the stuff of vomit-inducing viral videos, though, where someone puts cheddar cheese and cookie dough into a pie or something. Rather, it’s a place that treats food as both artful and functional, making it ideal vicarious viewing when cooking feels like an anchor to long days and even longer weekends.And then there’s telly. I’ve been getting through it more quickly than I ever have in my six months of working on the  TV desk, but, admittedly, there’s a fair amount of half-watching and double-screening going on.I’ve been in the mood for an improbable thriller to get lost in, and The Nest (BBC One), about a wealthy couple using a deprived teenager, has delivered. Incredible loch-side setting? Check. Completely wild plot? Check. Line of Duty’s Martin Compston using his real Scottish accent? Check. Potential for one, if not all, of its leads to end up a cold-blooded killer? Check. I’ve been eagerly collating my completely unproven theories, and watching along with the linear broadcasts rather than skipping ahead so that I can drag its five episodes out as much as possible.Whether it’s Twitter comedy, food porn or an improbable drama, there’s really no need to binge it all in one go now, is there? Unless it’s Tiger King – definitely, definitely binge that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed3fe0bc44c15b3407f58e7803be800807badd16/809_669_2109_1266/master/2109.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4f03b44691d34f27875a8324a646784","title":"industrial sized pig and chicken farming continuing to rise in uk","story":"Number of large-scale, intensive farms with upwards of 40,000 birds or 2,000 pigs is increasing, driven by demand for cheap meatNew figures reveal that the number of large industrial-sized pig and chicken farms in the UK continues to rise, with close to 2,000 across the country.Driven in part by supermarket pressure to keep prices low and consumer demand for cheap meat, the growth of industrial farming remains isive.Intensive pig and poultry farms have been linked to local bioersity damage from ammonia emissions and to detrimental impacts on local communities including noise pollution, increased traffic, and potentially harmful bacteria, viruses and air pollutants. It is also seen as a driver of deforestation in South America, through its reliance on protein-rich crops such as soya as animal feed.The intensification of the poultry sector has also generated local conflict with units often built in regional clusters surrounding slaughterhouses and factories. The Cluck Off campaign in Rushden, Northamptonshire, is fighting Bedfordia’s proposal for a six-shed unit for 314,000 birds, while in Horham and Southolt, Suffolk, locals are trying to stop Epigs Ltd’s plans for 12 poultry houses producing 800,000 chickens every eight weeks.The National Farmers’ Union says farm size is not the critical factor in dictating the welfare of birds. “It is crucial we recognise that animal husbandry and stockmanship are the greatest factors that determine animal health and welfare, not farm size or system of production,” said its chief poultry adviser, Gary Ford.Philip Lymbery of Compassion in World Farming hopes that Brexit will lead to a new policy direction, supported by political and public pressure: “We’re at a crossroads and have an opportunity to reinvent British food and farming. We can move towards a thriving countryside where farm animals are restored to the land.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8506b029720fc360f691b5c6329591018916b3df/0_179_3997_2398/master/3997.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fb9a94165e9bf49218a8c59bdee6408","title":"record size hole opens in ozone layer above the arctic","story":"Rare hole is result of low temperatures in atmosphere and is expected to disappear A rare hole has opened up in the ozone layer above the Arctic, in what scientists say is the result of unusually low temperatures in the atmosphere above the north pole.The hole, which has been tracked from space and the ground over the past few days, has reached record dimensions, but is not expected to pose any danger to humans unless it moves further south. If it extends further south over populated areas, such as southern Greenland, people would be at increased risk of sunburn. However, on current trends the hole is expected to disappear altogether in a few weeks.Low temperatures in the northern polar regions led to an unusual stable polar vortex, and the presence of ozone-destroying chemicals such as chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere – from human activities – caused the hole to form.The hole is not related to the Covid-19 shutdowns that have drastically cut air pollution and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. It is also too early to say whether the unusually stable Arctic polar vortex conditions are linked with the climate crisis, or part of normal stratospheric weather variability.Peuch said there were no direct implications for the climate crisis. Temperatures in the region are already increasing, slowing the depletion of ozone, and the hole will start to recede as polar air mixes with ozone-rich air from lower latitudes. The last time similar conditions were observed was in spring 2011.The hole was tracked by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, based partly in Reading and funded by the European commission.While a hole over the Arctic is a rare event, the much larger hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic has been a major cause for concern for more than four decades. The production of ozone-depleting chemicals has been drastically reduced, under the 1987 Montreal Protocol, but some sources appear still to be functioning – in 2018, unauthorised emissions were detected from eastern China.The Antarctic ozone hole was the smallest in 35 years last November, showing the success of efforts to cut the production of the harmful pollutants. The ozone layer protects the earth from harmful levels of ultraviolet radiation from the sun.New sources of ozone-depleting chemicals were not a factor in the hole observed in the Arctic, said Peuch. “However, this is a reminder that one should not take the Montreal Protocol measures for granted, and that observations from the ground and from satellites are pivotal to avoid a situation where the chlorine and bromine levels in the stratosphere could increase again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74ef4ea78e4b21e85cceeb4d1074f77ca973d608/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b69cb39d2594ba6b3b6048bfb4e41d3","title":"volcanic activity triggered triassic climate change","story":"Research offers ‘a sobering warning’ on the impact of today’s climate emergencyVolcanic eruptions played an important and direct role in triggering the extreme climate that killed off swathes of life at the end of the Triassic period 201m years ago, researchers have found.Experts say they have discovered bubbles of carbon dioxide trapped in volcanic rocks dating to the end of the Triassic, backing up the theory that such activity contributed to the greenhouse climate that is believed to have been behind the mass extinction.“This biotic crisis wiped out almost half of the existing species of the late Triassic in both marine and terrestrial realms,” said Manfredo Capriolo of the University of Padova in Italy, a co-author of the study.While Capriolo noted the end-Triassic mass extinction has long been known to have been caused by extreme climate change, and that there was large-scale volcanic activity at the time, he said it had been unclear whether the volcanic activity directly contributed to the extinction event. Among other possibilities, he said, it could have been that magma caused the emission of gases as it flowed into shallow sediments. The new work, said Capriolo, shows that carbon dioxide released directly by volcanic activity would indeed have made a large contribution to the devastating climate change of the time.Indeed the team say the amount of carbon emissions released in a single pulse of eruptions – which would have resulted in about 100,000 km3 of lava being spewed forth over 500 years – is on a par with the total expected to be produced by human activity over the 21st century, assuming a 2C rise in global temperature above pre-industrial levels.Capriolo stressed the similarity in CO2 levels was striking. “The end-Triassic world and the modern one are very different, as well as the origin of the greenhouse gas emissions, but we, as geoscientists, announce this alarming comparison,” he said.Writing in the journal Nature Communications, Capriolo and colleagues report how they studied more than 200 samples of rock from North America, Morocco and Portugal. These were deposited towards the end of the Triassic, in volcanic activity that contributed to the breakup of the Pangea supercontinent and the opening up of the central Atlantic Ocean, with the rocks creating what is known as the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province – a vast expanse covering an area about a third of the size the moon.From these findings the team were able to calculate the concentration of carbon dioxide that would have been present in the magma of the volcanic eruptions, revealing that up to 100,000 Gt of carbon dioxide would have been released in total as the volcanic rocks were laid down.Dr Jessica Whiteside, associate professor of geochemistry at the University of Southampton who was not involved in the work, said the role of volcanic activity in the end-Triassic mass extinction had been a matter of much debate. “Over the past 30 years, the question as to whether widespread volcanic eruptions trigger climatic effects severe enough to result in extinction has waxed and waned, from most certainly no to most certainly yes,” she said. The new study, she said, added weight to the latter view. “The study reports new evidence that is the most conclusive that has been produced for CO2 being emitted directly from inidual lava eruptions relating to the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province,” she said, adding that the report reveals pulses of the eruptions spewed out amounts on a par to those produced by human activities, with devastating effects.That, Whiteside added, provided lessons for today. “The initiation of these eruptions created one of the warmest climate since the dawn of animal life on our planet, and coincided with massive extinction on land and in the oceans,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93e4122471eaf894724deef6e83bd92fa00245d5/0_120_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e5d62f3d4b42ccd71f359ab4447888c","title":"human impact on wildlife to blame for spread of viruses says study aoe","story":"Increased contact with animals likely cause of outbreaks such as Covid-19, say experts, as conservationists call for global ban on wildlife marketsHunting, farming and the global move of people to cities has led to massive declines in bioersity and increased the risk of dangerous viruses like Covid-19 spilling over from animals to humans, a major study has concluded.In a paper that suggests the underlying cause of the present pandemic is likely to be increased human contact with wildlife, scientists from Australia and the US traced which animals were most likely to share pathogens with humans.Taking 142 viruses known to have been transmitted from animals to humans over many years, they matched them to the IUCN’s red list of threatened species.Domesticated animals like cattle, sheep, dogs and goats shared the highest number of viruses with humans, with eight times more animal-borne viruses than wild mammal species.The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, found that the spillover risk was highest from threatened and endangered wild animals whose populations had declined largely due to hunting, the wildlife trade and loss of habitat.“Human encroachment into bioerse areas increases the risk of spillover of novel infectious diseases by enabling new contacts between humans and wildlife … We found that species in the primate and bat orders were significantly more likely to harbour zoonotic viruses compared to all other orders,” it said.“Spillover of viruses from animals are a direct result of our actions involving wildlife and their habitat,” said lead author Christine Kreuder Johnson, director of the EpiCenter for Disease Dynamics at the One Health Institute, a programme of the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine.“The consequence is they’re sharing their viruses with us. These actions simultaneously threaten species survival and increase the risk of spillover. In an unfortunate convergence of many factors, this brings about the kind of mess we’re in now,” she said.“We need to be really attentive to how we interact with wildlife and the activities that bring humans and wildlife together. We obviously don’t want pandemics of this scale. We need to find ways to co-exist safely with wildlife, as they have no shortages of viruses to give us,” said Johnson.Separately, more than 200 of the world’s wildlife groups have written to the World Health Organization (WHO) calling on it to recommend to countries a highly precautionary approach to the multi-billion dollar wildlife trade, and a permanent ban on all live wildlife markets and the use of wildlife in traditional medicine.The Covid-19 pandemic, says the letter, is believed to have originated at wildlife markets in China, and to have been transmitted to humans as a result of the close proximity between wildlife and people.The groups, which include the International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Zoological Society of London and Peta, say a ban on wildlife markets globally will help prevent the spread of disease, and address “one of the major drivers of species extinction”.“This decisive action, well within the WHO’s mandate, would be an impactful first step in adopting a highly precautionary approach to wildlife trade that poses a risk to human health,” says the letter.The organisations argue that zoonotic diseases are responsible for over 2 billion cases of human illness and over 2 million human deaths each year, including from Ebola, Mers, HIV, bovine tuberculosis, rabies, and leptospirosis.The letter follows acting UN bioersity chief Elizabeth Maruma Mrema’s call in the  this week for a global ban on wildlife markets.Unlike the conservation groups, Mrema, the acting executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, emphasised that millions of people, particularly in Africa, depend on wild animals for food and that alternatives to wet markets are needed.In a growing sign that global organisations are embarrassed by the emergence of zoonotic diseases in traded animals, Cites, the body which regulates the international trade of animals, refused to be drawn into the growing debate about the origins of Covid-19.In a terse statement it said: “Matters regarding zoonotic diseases are outside of Cites’s mandate and the Secretariat does not have the competence to make comments on the recent news on the possible links between human consumption of wild animals and Covid-19.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e186d396242334e5b841673c4bff236279c3e5cd/1540_805_1822_1093/master/1822..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56fab168ab8fdecf819a55a06babbfe0","title":"kim wilde i look miserable but i was having the time of my life","story":"The singer on pouting like Lauren Bacall, DIY hairdos, gardening in nightwear and discovering the joys of colourThis was taken in 1981 or 1982, right at the beginning of my career.

It requires barely any prep, and it’s endlessly adaptable: use yellow or red split peas instead of green, if that’s all you can get hold of honey, molasses and agave nectar are more than useful stand-ins for maple syrup and substitute fresh parsley for the coriander, if need be. And if you’re making it for children or for the spice-averse, simply leave out the jalapeño altogether and use paprika instead of chipotle.One-tray pork and mushroom pastaKA: Again, use what you have – shiitake mushrooms are a good swap for oyster (they’re cheaper, too), ditch the paccheri for another large-ish pasta tube such as tortiglioni or rigatoni, and try beef mince instead of pork if you have to – it won’t be the same, but needs must.Herby cabbage and potato gratin with gruyère and ricottaKA: If the local supermarket’s run out of desiree potatoes, another good all-rounder such as estima or vivaldi will also do the trick. If there’s no gruyère in the chiller cabinet, try comté, beaufort or emmental, and for ricotta, go for fromage frais or good old cottage cheese.Baked cauliflower with spices, spinach and tomatoKA: If you can’t find black mustard seeds, use yellow, or three-quarters of a teaspoon of mustard powder, or up to a tablespoon of ready-made mustard. Again, parsley makes a decent stand-in for the coriander, while you can replace the spinach with any other delicate green, or use frozen.KA: There’s no reason you have to cook this favourite brunch on the stovetop. It works just as well in the oven, which if anything makes it easier to prepare, too. Use any tinned white beans you have to hand, and in the absence of harissa use dried or fresh chilli to taste instead.Roast roots with butter alla diavolaKA: If you can’t get turnips, this treatment work on just about any other root veg, too, from carrots and potatoes to celeriac and parsnips failing them, squash would make a handy sub as well.Tomato and chicken traybakeKA: Swap tinned tomatoes or passata for fresh, if need be, and swap the thyme for any other soft herb you have to hand (oregano or marjarom, ideally, though there’s nothing wrong with parsley or coriander if that’s all you can get dried oregano or herbes de Provence would be another option). This treatment also works a treat on fish – whole or fillets, fresh or frozen and defrosted – though if you do go down that road, bake the tomatoes and seasonings alone for the first 10 minutes, then add the fish and, depending on size and cut, scale down the remaining cooking time as required.Braised hispi cabbage with chorizo and chickpeasKA: If the shops are out of hispi (it’s also known as pointed and sweetheart cabbage), try any other green cabbage you can find, even a young, firm savoy. Soured cream or Greek yoghurt can take the place of the creme fraiche if all else fails.Date traybake with toffeeKA: Dried figs will do the job of the mejdool dates, if need be, while honey, maple syrup, or molasses will all add the caramel sweetness of date syrup if that proves hard to get hold of.KA: The warm milk infusion is good enough to drink just as it is, and you can easily mix and match the spices used to suit availability and personal taste (if you can’t find cardamom, say, add a touch of nutmeg to the mix – combined with the cinnamon, it makes an OK substitute – while allspice can take the place of the cloves).KA: Any soft fruit or berries will top off this sponge cake version of the British summer classic in style."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7315776a8077016967ba1ca83a7beb034fc7cc50/0_233_5214_3130/master/5214.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11560e1d8c043a3050f84d230eb9bdd1","title":"fifa approves extended player contracts and later transfer windows","story":"Fifa has approved plans to extend player contracts and move transfer windows to allow seasons on hold due to coronavirus to be completed.A set of new guidelines was endorsed by the Fifa bureau – a slimmed-down version of its decision-making council – on Tuesday. These included the recommendation that players’ expiring contracts can be extended beyond the end of June and confirmation that it would permit transfer windows to be put back beyond the end of August and inserted into the gap between this season and its delayed successor.Transfer deals due to be completed this summer will be “delayed until the next season actually does start”.Fifa also said it would encourage clubs and players “to work together to find agreements and solutions during the period when football is suspended” and the game has to deal with an unprecedented loss of revenue.In addressing the practical and logistical issues stemming from the pandemic the world governing body has eliminated legal barriers that would otherwise have made the idea of completing the season untenable.These temporary solutions were drafted by a task force chaired by a Fifa vice-president, Vittorio Montagliani, and including representatives of clubs, players, leagues, national FAs and continental confederations.“The Covid-19 pandemic has clearly changed all the factual circumstances around football for this season,” said Gianni Infantino, the Fifa president. “So, Fifa has come up with some practical ideas and proposals to tackle these new circumstances. Whilst this will not solve each and every problem, it should serve to bring a measure of stability and clarity to football. We hope that this collaborative effort can provide a positive example of how football can come together and show unity, solidarity and a spirit of compromise in order to face the challenging times ahead.”On the thorny issue of pay cuts and wage deferrals, Fifa has advised a spirit of compromise. It advocates “looking at all aspects of each situation in an even handed manner, including what government measures are there to support clubs and players, whether pay should be deferred or reduced and what insurance coverage may exist”.If agreement is impossible, it will serve as a final arbiter. “If parties cannot agree and, as a consequence, cases come to Fifa, the factors to be examined will include the following: whether there was a genuine attempt by the club to reach agreement with the players what the economic situation of the club is the proportionality of any adjustment to player contracts the net income position of players after any contract adjustment and whether players have been treated equally or not.“Fifa hopes that it will be able to find solutions that are fair and balanced for both sides.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0612e3aba5ba36dee1120cb3b9f60283eb9ca5a0/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7d0d4c4a5c0e64630ee5fa20929621b","title":"its maths for dummies how wages debate is viewed inside the game","story":"With discussion raging over player pay, players, chairmen and an agent reveal what they’re really thinkingBut really we’ve looked at the situation internally, with the comments of the health minister, Matt Hancock, not helping, when we would be better advised to look at it externally in terms of the Premier League as a business and raise money. You could do this via a loan, secured against future broadcast revenues, which are due to go up and up – regardless of the pandemic. Demand far outweighs supply at the moment.Covid-19 is a freak situation. It’s got nothing to do with bad business practices at the Premier League or the clubs and I don’t understand why an external short-term loan against the broadcast revenues, plugging the £750m gap, can’t be done. We then save government money by not using furloughs and this can be given to the NHS. The money that players pay in tax could also be safeguarded and put towards the fight against the virus. To me, this is just a clean solution.We’re fortunate at Colchester in that the club is financially well looked after. We sold a couple of players last summer and our run to the Carabao Cup quarter-final stood us in good stead. But if you look at, say, Macclesfield, a club already in money trouble with boys not getting paid on time, you dread to think of being in their shoes. It’s not just about the players getting their wages, it’s whether the clubs are going to stay afloat. All of this is going to have a massive effect in League Two. We got an email saying that we’d get April’s pay but we’ve not had an update since. I know quite a lot of clubs, especially in League Two, have used the furlough scheme and, although we haven’t done that as of yet with our staff, it’s just that not knowing. It’s not looking like football is going to restart in May so I don’t know what’s going to happen. We’re meant to be back in for training next Tuesday but I’d be amazed if that were the case.I’m 32 next month and out of contract in June. I’d like to stay on but will any offer be there now because of money? It’s going to be an interesting summer and it might be hard for players to get clubs.Our players do a great job for us as a club and for the community. They probably do their own things on top that I’m not aware of. They are intelligent people. We will not be unilaterally trying to impose things on any players. If they decided to help us in any way we’d be grateful but we wouldn’t think any less of them if they didn’t. It’s as simple as that. But talks are ongoing.We’ve taken the decision, certainly short-to-medium term, that we will fund non-playing staff. We will not be furloughing them. If we get to July and the season hasn’t restarted, and the next season isn’t looking like it is going to start, that’s a different position and we might have to revisit it. But at the moment we are going to be funding that ourselves. The absolute worst-case, doomsday scenario is that we don’t finish the season and there is no new season in sight.I personally don’t think it will come to that. I think we will start when it’s safe to do so. We need to start but if we didn’t then we’ve got some resources at the club. I’m confident we will get through it, we are not going to go bust, but it’s not going to be easy. Mike Garlick was speaking to BBC Radio 5 LiveSome clubs are in a more difficult position at an earlier stage than others – it wasn’t that long ago that we remember not being able to pay wages on a Friday if we didn’t have a game on the Saturday before, so I understand the position that some may be in. There are difficulties facing the board of the EFL because depending on where you sit, you could have an opposite view – you might be at the top of the league or the bottom of the league, cash-rich or cash-poor – so trying to work out those possible scenarios, in terms of what’s best for everybody, is particularly difficult.Our players take home, on average, around £800 a week and some of our senior playing staff have already deferred wages voluntarily but they are all in different situations. Nobody is going to come out of this happy but the key underneath all of this is the Premier League, who are beginning to unfold their thinking and how they intend to deal with this from a financial point of view and how that finance drips down into the leagues, and the PFA, who have given indications, but nothing definitive. They have to consult their members, which is exactly right, and those things take time, but people are becoming impatient because they are very worried.It is very easy to be critical but when you consider the magnitude of the issues and the problems that the EFL are facing, they are doing a good job in trying to guide us through this unbelievably difficult period. Will it have an impact? Absolutely. I have no crystal ball but I would have thought it would impact the number of players in a squad and also the wages they earn.Many clubs have quite genuine and, in some cases, serious cash‑flow problems caused by the unforeseeable suspension of football. Like many businesses across the country they have an urgent need to reduce their overheads and the largest is often the wage bill. Clubs will be looking at wages for both playing and non‑playing staff, trying to understand where they can make savings, then balancing that against the contractual and legal issues, as well as the government support available. Players, on the other hand, are finding themselves being asked to take a pay cut. Whilst in many cases the players are more than happy to do their bit, they are keen to understand whether the measures proposed are proportionate, absolutely necessary and whether they are temporary or permanent. I believe that in most cases there is a common desire to be realistic and to find solutions that are fair. There will be cases where players feel that their club is behaving opportunistically and perhaps requesting financial sacrifices that go beyond what might be reasonable. Conversely, there will be cases where clubs are in such financial hardship they genuinely risk insolvency if they cannot make urgent reductions in April’s payroll, yet not all employees will be keen to facilitate that.These differing perspectives would likely be found in most workplaces across the country. The attention that has been brought to bear upon clubs and players, however, is unique. There is no doubt that high-profile pressure has, on the one hand, shone a spotlight on the sport but on the other it has made some parties feel they are being forced to act rather than choosing to. I suspect we will continue to see many clubs and players reaching their own resolutions at club level and I dare say we will also see disagreements prevail at certain clubs. I am not so sure that a sport-wide solution is going to be achievable. Nor, perhaps, is it desirable.Dan Chapman is a solicitor and partner at the law firm Leathes Prior"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d6e811dc1363f87580448105500ddd552f68bf4/305_135_1352_811/master/1352.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b26a7222a7106602988a5a4af79bdc7","title":"sadio mane documentary made in senegal liverpool","story":"A new documentary shows how much the Liverpool striker was influenced by his father’s early death and why he is funding a hospital back in SenegalOf all the remarkable stories in the new documentary about Sadio Mané, there is one that stands out. From childhood memories of using a grapefruit as a ball in the remote village of Bambali to Liverpool’s Champions League triumph in 2019, Made in Senegal features Mané narrating his rags-to-riches story and includes interviews with Jürgen Klopp and several of his Anfield teammates including Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk. Yet Mané’s recollection of the day his father died is undoubtedly its most poignant moment.“I was seven years old,” he says in the film. “We were about to play on the field when a cousin approached me and said: ‘Sadio, your father passed away.’ I replied: ‘Oh really? He’s joking …’ I couldn’t really understand it.”“Before he passed away, he had this kind of sickness for weeks,” Mané tells the . “We brought him some traditional medicine and it kept him calm for three or four months. The sickness came back but this time the medicine didn’t work and because there was no hospital in Bambali they had to take him to the next village to see if they could save his life. But it was not the case.“When I was young my dad was always saying how proud he was of me,” he adds. “He was a man with a big heart. When he died, it had a big impact on me and the rest of my family. I said to myself: ‘Now I have to do my best to help my mother.’ That’s a hard thing to deal with when you are so young.”Mané’s father was an imam and the family gather every year on the anniversary of his death to recite the Qur’an. Having failed to convince his family to allow him to abandon his education so he could pursue his ambition of becoming a professional footballer, Mané ran away from home at the age of 15 with the help of a childhood friend Luc Djiboune.“It was tough because I didn’t have anyone behind me to push me to achieve my dream,” he says. “But I never stopped dreaming. It was really brave to leave my family in the village and go to Dakar but I knew that I could be successful. After that, my family started to take it more seriously and knew that I didn’t want to do anything else. They knew they had no choice so they helped me.”It was at the Generation Foot academy in the Senegal capital, Dakar, that Mané’s journey to stardom really began after he scored four goals during a trial match. “I think they were impressed,” he says in the film. Under the watchful eye of founder Mady Touré, whom Mané describes as “like a dad to me”, he was snapped up by the French club Metz at the start of 2011 and moved to the Austrian side Red Bull Salzburg 18 months later having played a key role in Senegal’s run to the quarter-finals of the 2012 Olympics.Klopp remembers passing up the chance to sign him for Borussia Dortmund in 2014 having made a judgment based on the way he was wearing his baseball cap.“He said I was like a rapper!” Mané says, chuckling at the memory. “But I think I gave my best so what can I say? That’s part of life – you never know how you are going to get along with people. But I think he was wrong for sure. It was an experience for me as well though. I knew I had to show him more until we met again …”Klopp finally got his man in 2016 after Mané scored four goals in three appearances against Liverpool for Southampton, and Mané’s admiration for his manager is evident in the film as he is shown driving home following the incredible comeback victory over Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final last year.The dressing room celebrations after Liverpool’s victory over Tottenham in Madrid make for entertaining viewing but that is nothing compared with the reception Mané receives on his return to Bambali. Walking around the village surrounded by jubilant fans, he recognises an old lady and asks why she hasn’t returned his phone calls?“You’d call me if you missed me,” he says. “I gave you my number.”“I haven’t got a phone,” comes the reply, much to Mané’s amusement.His naturally cheerful demeanour and humbleness shine throughout the documentary, especially when he addresses a crowd of youths outside the new school and tells them “education is the key”. “School comes first,” he says. “You should be in good health before you go to work, so let’s finish the hospital.”“When you see these kind of people and the offerings in front of the house, you think: ‘Wow, I have to work even harder for them,” says Mané, who has also contributed £40,000 to the Senegal government to help fight coronavirus.“Maybe if there had been a better school when I was younger maybe I could have studied more. But it was not the case – I was in the village. So all the boys there want to play football and no one wants to go to school any more.

While the condition can be treated effectively in the west, in low-income countries there is a need to improve access to insulin, medical devices, and health programmes to ensure early diagnosis and careTogether with cardiovascular diseases, cancers and chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes has become one of the world’s four major non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and one of the only chronic diseases that continues to increase in prevalence.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of people with diabetes increased from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014, and in 2016 it caused 1.6 million deaths, making it the seventh leading cause of death. The WHO estimates deaths from diabetes will increase to 2.4 million in 2030 and 3.7 million in 2045.The pharmaceutical industry is ramping up efforts to tackle diabetes through Global Health Progress, with more than 40 partnerships now researching new medicines, as well as new ways in which to diagnose and raise awareness of the disease.But what’s important, says Vanessa Peberdy, head of NCD advocacy and policy at the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), is that “the dialogue around diabetes treatment and care is not just confined to discussions on affordability and access to insulin. While this is clearly a critical issue, improving treatment and care requires a holistic approach that recognises the complexity of the condition. It needs to take in issues such as a lack of trained health practitioners, inadequate supply chains and weak health systems in developing countries.”“Access is a complex issue,” says Helen McGuire, programme leader, noncommunicable diseases at global health organisation Path. “Failures of access in low-resource settings are rarely due to a single cause.“Barriers must be addressed by leveraging multi-sectoral partnerships, which bring the unique expertise and resources of governments, non-profits, and industry to the table. Solutions require a long-term approach addressing issues of quality, affordability, availability, acceptability, and sustainability.”Emma Klatman is a health systems specialist at the international diabetes charity Life for a Child, which is tackling type 1 diabetes in low and middle income countries, where mortality rates among young people are especially high.Living without treatment can have horrific consequences, she says, and young people are faced with “blindness, losing limbs, developing kidney problems, and they just remain chronically unwell. They can struggle to complete their education, and find employment and marriage partners, and really do face a lot of social stigma.”The charity supplies local health centres with insulin, as well as blood glucose meters and testing strips, which Klatman says are an equally important part of effectively treating diabetes.It’s a point echoed by McGuire. “Self-care is essential to meet the daily demands of managing diabetes – therefore it is critical to take a people-centered approach to designing solutions,” she says. “Co-packaging of insulin, syringes, and glucose monitoring devices and strips together at an affordable price would go a long way to support people living with diabetes to safely administer insulin and monitor their glucose levels in low- and middle-income countries.”Next year is the centenary of insulin’s discovery, and ever since its first use the pharmaceutical industry has been developing new ways in which it can be delivered to patients.The first insulin pen was introduced in 1985 and immediately improved the accuracy of treatment. Now researchers are exploring an oral treatment for type 2 diabetes that will mean patients no longer need to inject at all. A smart insulin patch is also being developed that delivers tailored amounts of insulin into the bloodstream, and a new generation of insulin pumps can now be connected wirelessly to a blood glucose meter or under-the-skin sensor to monitor and regulate insulin.Research into the development of an artificial pancreas at the University of Cambridge is on-going, as is R\u0026ampD into cell therapy, when living cells are injected into patients to take over the function of the faulty ones.Sanofi, which along with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly make up the big three insulin manufacturers, has recently changed its approach to diabetes, shifting emphasis from new treatments to helping people to use existing medicines more effectively.Working with Biocorp, for instance, Sanofi is developing a new connected pen that automatically records dosage information through a mobile app. Its MyStar DoseCoach blood glucose meter uses a dose adjustment (titration) scheme to recommend daily doses of long-acting insulin, based on daily blood sugar measurements linked to any incidents of low blood sugar through the day.“Affordability of insulin is just one of the necessary components, along with creating awareness in the communities, building capacity for care and medicine supply, educating patients, improving demand forecasting and reducing transportation costs for the patients.”Klatman sees the growth of partnerships like this as crucial to providing the level of diabetes care that is needed in developing countries, and looks forward to the day when families “are able to access insulin and other supplies without being exposed to financial risk, and having to make really tough decisions to keep their kids alive”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce8c303935e35b3ae3afd3784d78e50cf9af43d2/1664_1470_4982_2989/master/4982..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da4e64dfb85b22b9bc3af498aa1284bf","title":"how are you celebrating your birthday under coronavirus lockdown","story":"If you are expecting a birthday while under practicing physical distancing due to coronavirus, we’d like to hear from youWith the UK in its third week of government measures to avoid the spread of coronavirus, we would like to hear from those who are celebrating their birthdays under lockdown.How will you be celebrating your birthday?

I have spent years mentally preparing for a civil war, but I never planned on this. This lethal, invisible, unpredictable … waste of everyone’s time. “All of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone,” Blaise Pascal mused in the 17th century. He would be confounded by 2020, in which a lot of us are doing exactly that, and finding that it sucks. I forgive him, though. It is hard to stay mad at a Catholic mathematician whose name sounds like a burlesque dancer.Locked down alone, I experience deep loneliness, of a claustrophobic and urgent nature. The kind of ungraspable panic that messaging and video calls and social media cannot touch, not knowing when I will next hug my mum, or experience affectionate physical contact, or punch my friend Amish Tom.To make some sort of sense of the situation, I visualise what is happening as a giant, forbidden psychological experiment: the kind that no sample size will ever match, nor ethics board approve. With more than half a planet confined indoors, what can we learn about who we are? That we think with our anuses first. That we are a hopeful, persistent species. That we are funny. Kind, too, apart from when we are afraid. It has also proved that many of us are brave beyond belief.Not me, mind you. I can’t even glance at the news. To balance this lack of courage, I donate more to charity, to aid those supporting the most vulnerable, putting their own health on the line. I live in London, where a single drink with a friend costs £450, so I figure I am making a saving anyway.What else? I have spent years wishing for a pop-cultural pause button. In particular, hoping studios would stop pumping out must-see TV shows and give me time to actually see them. So that has been useful. It is nice to redefine productivity and pleasure, such as the time I added cardamom to a banana cake. That was yesterday.The unexpected consolation of distance is that I have never felt more connected, even to those I don’t know. That disingenuous phrase “We’re all in this together” has finally come true. (A similar atmosphere to the World Cup, except we are hoping to win a flattened bell? Worst trophy ever.) There cannot be anyone left who does not now recognise the value of society, or how crucial its lowest-paid jobs are.The experiment has important results for us on a personal level, too. It reminds us life is not infinite. And loss reminds us of what we love. It reminds us how painful love is, how instinctive and near the surface, and how without it we are nothing. A hard, precious lesson.Sadness has value. The virus will pass. There will be emotional reunions, explosions of carnality, wildly alcoholic picnics to come. We will be rich in freedoms again.

I just wanted to check to see if you’re OK? I have drawn you a rainbow to remind you that you are not alone. Please write back if you can.”Ron “at number 24”, aged 93, said he was so pleased to receive the message, and had placed the drawing in his window. “Like you I am in isolation so it was so nice to hear of your concern for me,” he wrote back.“I was the first person to move into the crescent in 1955 and I have been here ever since. The situation with coronavirus is very bad and we must all do our very best to overcome it and hopefully come out of it in good health again.”Louisa Smith, 23, posted the letter on Twitter and said her grandad Ron, who lives alone in Wolverhampton, was self-isolating but in good health.“He was just overwhelmed by it. I think he was quite shocked that they’d thought about him, and the fact she’s only five,” said Smith. “But that’s what’s so beautiful about it, the age gap.”Staff at a care home in Newcastle have gone the extra mile to cheer up residents during the lockdown, helping them write messages to their loved ones and even creating their own in-house ice-cream van.With the local ice-cream van no longer able to visit as it usually does, staff at West Farm Care Centre recreated the experience with their own “Mrs Whippy” station, using an online ice-cream jingle.“I hate taking things away, I absolutely hate it, so we’ve just had to think more creatively and out of the box,” said Lucy Craig, owner of Craig Healthcare which runs the residence along with nearby Cramlington House. “It helps create smiles, energy and the feeling that things are as normal as they possibly can.”Across both care homes, workers have also been helping residents connect with their loved ones, who are no longer able to visit, by taking pictures of them holding up messages, and arranging video calls.“Coronavirus can do one,” read the sign of one resident, while another said: “I love you’s. Don’t worry, I’m okay.”Local families who live next to Cramlington House have also reached out to the residents with letters and video calls, to help keep them company while they’re separated from family.“It gives them a sense of reality beyond the front door, and tells them there’s a community out there that genuinely care,” said Craig.A video of NHS staff applauding an 84-year-old granddad as he leaves hospital after beating coronavirus has gone viral on Twitter, with over 2m views.Staff wearing face masks and aprons line the corridor at Manchester Royal Infirmary and applaud as Solomon McFarlane is transported in his wheelchair towards the doors, after spending two weeks in hospital with the virus.“One of the nurses said it was a guard of honour. It was beautiful. Absolutely beautiful,” said McFarlane’s daughter, Esther. “We called him in hospital and encouraged him, said: ‘You’ve got to fight this.’ And we all prayed for him.”“It just shows that this Covid can be beaten, it’s a video of hope,” she added.Posting the video to Twitter, his granddaughter Rokaia, known as Sapph, said: “He had tested positive for Covid-19 then ended up having pneumonia.“The drs said he was ‘deteriorating’ and the next 24hrs are ‘critical’ but God! My Granddad is 84 years old and has beaten Covid-19. Thank you NHS staff.”McFarlane is now back home in Manchester with his wife and son.Medical staff have been pinning pictures of themselves over the top of their protective gear to help patients see the faces of those treating them.A photo posted on Twitter shows three Israeli medics with pictures pinned over their hazmat suits. With their face masks and hoods, patients can only see the eyes of those caring for them.Over in California, Robertino Rodriguez took similar action by pinning a laminated photo of himself with his name and job role over the top of his protective suit.“Yesterday I felt bad for the patients in my ER when I would come in the room with my face covered in PPE,” he said.“A reassuring smile makes a big difference to a scared patient. So today I made a giant laminated badge for my PPE so my patients can see a reassuring \u0026amp comforting smile.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abef7a93605f46815e90a98ca513ea889e14741e/0_0_3239_1945/master/3239..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86f65c1ac1cf9b0e80767625ab12c55c","title":"the devastating impact of covid 19 in new york podcast","story":" US health reporter Jessica Glenza reports from New York, where medical facilities and staff are being overwhelmed by the Covid-19 outbreak New York City is a densely populated city that welcomes millions of visitors every month – which in part explains why it’s been hit so hard by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Now, with Boris Johnson ill, it seems to stop nowhereIt’s now all down to a matter of trust. Last June, the Conservative party decided it didn’t rate Dominic Raab highly enough for him to even make the last five of the leadership contest. Imagine the humiliation of being considered to have less credibility than Michael Gove.Yet now, with Boris Johnson in intensive care, Raab is the interim leader of the country at a time of national emergency. “You’ve got to ask yourself one question. Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?” The answer for most of us is a resounding “no”. We don’t feel in the slightest bit lucky, thank you.Neither, it seems, does Raab. The gap between vaulting ambition and practical reality has never seemed so wide. When he looks in the mirror, Dom no longer sees the decisive man of action he has always imagined himself to be. Rather he just gazes at uncertainty and hesitancy.The crown weighs far more heavily than he had ever anticipated. He can’t even trust himself these days. The day before, he had insisted Boris was on top form and running the country from his hospital bed. Just three hours later, we were told the prime minister had been moved to intensive care.In the meantime, the Govester doesn’t even trust Dom to make the coffee at cabinet meetingsIt’s hard to come back from that. Either the foreign secretary had been kept out of the loop about Boris’s state of health or he had lied to the country. Neither of which was a good look for the man whose prime responsibility was to bring a sense of reassurance and stability to a country worried about the health of its leader.Boris might not be everyone’s idea of a national Daddy, but he’s the only Daddy we’ve got and no one wants to lose their Dad. It’s as primal and terrifying as that. The country hasn’t felt this anxious and unsettled in decades.Raab didn’t look quite as sweaty and edgy on Tuesday as he had the day before: instead, the panic resided entirely in his eyes that darted this way and that, avoiding direct contact with everyone. He started by getting to the question everyone wanted answered. The prime minister had been stable overnight, was receiving the best care and had needed no invasive ventilation. Good news.“I’m confident he’ll pull through,” he said. “He’s a fighter.” Cue a collective groan of despair. We were back in the mythology of plucky Brits single-handedly taking on the Hun. Fighting the coronavirus on the beaches and in the hedgerows.We’re not in a war. We’re in a pandemic. The two things are totally different. And the many thousands who have already died from the disease did not do so because they were too weak or didn’t fight hard enough. They died because they were too ill to live and there was nothing the doctors could do to save them.The foreign secretary was no more convincing on who actually was running the country in Boris’s absence. “Government has always worked on collective responsibility,” he said casually.Er, yes. Except the buck has always stopped with the prime minister. Now it seemed the buck stopped nowhere. All that was happening was that the entire cabinet was gathering round a crystal ball, while trying to channel the inner spirit of Boris.And what was coming back was presumably total gibberish, as it’s been well documented that in the week Boris was in isolation in Downing Street the entire cabinet was squabbling like rats in a sack. Some have never even left the sack. Despite being home secretary, Priti Patel has never been allowed anywhere near a No 10 press briefing. Small mercies, I suppose.In the meantime, the Govester doesn’t even trust Dom to make the coffee at cabinet meetings. God knows what would happen if there was another serious emergency, such as floods or a terrorist attack. The entire cabinet would be briefing against each other, with each person having a different idea of what Boris would really have wanted. Presumably Mikey and Dom have already arm-wrestled one another for possession of the nuclear button. It’s leadership, Jim, but not as we know it.Nor did persistent questioning from the media about who really was in charge result in any more clarity. Everyone was just getting on and doing what Boris would have wanted, even though the circumstances might since have changed.All that did become clear was that Raab’s idea of collective responsibility was every man and woman for themselves. Asked about the government’s commitment to 100,000 tests by the end of the month, Dom casually threw Matt Hancock, the health sercretary, under the wheels of a bus. Nothing to go with me, Guv. Ask Tigger.The only person to really level with the country was the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty. Thank goodness, he’s back. After the chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance had observed that the UK’s death rates were broadly in line with Italy, Spain and France, Whitty alone dared to comment on why Germany’s might be so much lower.Testing, testing, testing. The Germans had taken the coronavirus more seriously at a much earlier stage than other countries and had planned accordingly. The UK was paying the price for its government having been too slow to act.There was one adult in Downing Street, then. Just a shame he’s not in the cabinet. Still, perhaps after Wednesday morning’s fantasy football “What would Boris do next?” cabinet meeting, one minister will be available to tell us who really is running the country while the prime minister recovers in hospital."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c371dd0b5c6545c5c4f6b78e77b3ea7d853965a2/0_57_1478_887/master/1478.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9106067ec5a78e4cc5b73a4d1bf1948","title":"scientists capture image of black hole emitting high energy jets","story":"Detailed image taken by Event Horizon Telescope of black hole 5bn light years awayAn image of a huge, powerful jet of plasma powered by a supermassive black hole has been captured by researchers in unprecedented detail.The team say the bright blob on the left of the image is thought to be the disc of gas and dust swirling around the black hole, with the jet of plasma depicted by a stream of less intense red features apparently emanating from it.Experts say the jet is part a structure known as a blazar. These are formed from quasars – supermassive black holes which are actively sucking in material – that wind up magnetic fields as they spin, resulting in material from around the black hole being shot out in two jets, one of which points towards the Earth.“Black holes don’t just swallow up a lot of matter, they spit a lot of it out too because they are highly magnetised and spinning so rapidly,” he added.Crucially, the team say, the image is the highest resolution yet of a jet around a supermassive black hole, meaning the researchers can for the first time investigate what is happening near the base of the jet. Indeed a close-up image shows a blob near the black hole that appears to be slightly off the axis of the rest of the jet.“It is offset by a good few degrees,” said Younsi.That, he added, means there may be a sort of “kink” at the base of the jet, or material that is being twisted around the jet. Alternatively, the blobs could be part of the edge of the disc of gas and dust that surrounds and feeds the black hole.But, Younsi added, questions remain, including what exactly the plasma of the jet is composed of, and exactly how the jet couples with the black hole.The image, published in the journal Astronomy \u0026amp Astrophysics, was captured by the Event Horizon Telescope – a huge research effort involving a network of eight radio telescopes, and a large team of researchers, around the world.The team say the black hole is part of a quasar called 3C 279, and is 200 times larger than the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way. The quasar, they add, lies in a galaxy 5bn light years away in the constellation Virgo.“It is actually very far away,” said Younsi. “Normally we wouldn’t be able to see anything, because the light would just be so red-shifted by the time it reaches us.“But because this jet is fired almost directly towards us, all of that radiation is boosted and it appears a lot brighter than it really is and so we are able to detect it.”The direction of the jet, pointing towards Earth, also explains another curiosity – why the jet appears to be travelling 15-20 times faster than the speed of light.“It is a projection effect,” said Younsi, noting that the is jet actually travelling about 0.995 times the speed of light.The new work is not the first stunning image from the Event Horizon Telescope endeavour: last year the team released the first image of a black hole, revealing a glowing halo of gas and dust.That, he added, is important as not all galaxies have a black hole with large-scale jets – including our own Milky Way. “One of the big questions is why – why don’t we have a big jet like a lot of other galaxies?” said Younsi.Younsi said the new image was a sign of things to come.“This is just very preliminary work, this is the beginning really,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a7395e33072724936a78190f466fcde97364756/0_216_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0deedb1c8feabc3829fd8671f9b8169","title":"stay active and curious 20 tips to help avoid sadness in lockdown","story":"Most Britons are confined to their homes, and many of us are finding it hard. But focusing on connection, diet and sleep can helpI am enjoying lockdown more than I thought I would. I get up early, go for a very long walk with the dog, do a one-hour home workout later in the day, plus lots of writing, lots of reading, lots of music, a bit of telly. And I am lucky to be confined with a partner whose company I actually enjoy.So I am not currently depressed, although I know from experience that this can change quickly. But I hope that my experience of depression, and how I have learned to deal with it, can be of use to others who are in lockdown. In many way, this sense of universal anxiety has been a great leveller, in that millions of people who have no personal experience of mental ill health are getting an insight into what it might feel like.Here are a few tips and thoughts that have been of help to me, both in guarding against depression and dealing with it when it comes.1 Look after key relationships. Your partner, your children, parents and grandparents, siblings, closest friends. Really try to look out for them.2 Stay active. The temptation to do nothing is strong. Try to resist it.3 Exercise. It is vital to physical and mental wellbeing.4 Watch your diet. For many people, boredom  eating, dislocation  eating, loneliness  eating. It is important to be aware of it. Try to eat healthily.5 Keep an eye on the booze. Someone tweeted recently: “This is like Christmas without the fun!” I think we all know what they mean.6 Sleep. I have been struggling with this one. But an early night is a good night.7 Read books. Don’t be a 247 news junkie. Books that have nothing to do with the current crisis, fiction or nonfiction, can be such a wonderful release.8 Cut down on social media. Endlessly scrolling through Twitter and Instagram is not healthy.9 Listen to music regularly.10 Even better – make music. I play bagpipes and they are out every day.11 Write down your thoughts. Keep a diary. Make lists.12 Keep in touch with the people you would normally be in contact with.13 Get in touch with someone you have lost contact with.14 Do something good for someone else every day.15 Do the easy things if you are finding it hard to do the difficult things.16 Stay curious. Try new things.17 Enjoy nature. If you follow me on social media, you will know I have been posting tree of the day photos ( has a tree of the week column). I cannot tell you how much pleasure I get on my morning walk deciding which tree to pick.18 Remember that all crises end eventually. By the time this one is over, there will have been a lot of death, a lot of grief, a lot of suffering. But it will end, and most of the world will still be here. So …19 Keep things in perspective. Don’t panic. And finally …20 See an opportunity in every setback. The whole world is going to have to take that approach when this is all over, but we can do it in our own lives now. Most people are being kinder. There is a boom in volunteering. There is more respect for so-called unskilled workers, more appreciation of NHS staff and carers. The air is cleaner. My asthma is better. My carbon footprint has shrunk from dreadful to almost Greta-like. I guess that is a long-winded way of saying try to look on the bright side. What choice do we have?This is an edited version of an article that was published originally on Alastair Campbell’s website"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28d106f253370cdee9f5836ca881f48afbf270f6/0_118_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c059d077fa76aacedae18cf95d487a3","title":"guineas and derby postponed royal ascot horse racing coronavirus emergency","story":"What’s the point of Royal Ascot without the fancy dresses, absurd hats and the champagne-guzzling revellers who wear them? If there is an answer to that question, it will be identified this summer, as the 109-year-old event is to be staged behind closed doors, assuming that it goes ahead at all.Fans of horse racing felt the ground shifting beneath their feet when the news was announced on Tuesday afternoon, just moments after Jockey Club officials said the first four Classic races of the year, the 1,000 and 2,000 Guineas, the Derby and the Oaks, were to be postponed indefinitely. The Guineas would normally take place at Newmarket in May, the Derby and the Oaks at Epsom in early June, but it is now accepted as impossible to press ahead with such important races on those dates.It was widely imagined that Royal Ascot could also be postponed until, say, late July in the hope that racing might be up and running by then. But many of the races scheduled to take place there are designed for a particular moment in the development of two-year-old and three-year-old thoroughbreds. Delaying them would mean bumping into competing races at other tracks, later in the summer.Those who run the Queen’s track accept it will have to be mid-June or nothing, and they see no prospect, in view of the present restrictions necessitated by coronavirus, of their being allowed to bring in up to 70,000 people per day just two months from now.But Ascot’s spokesman, Nick Smith, waved away a suggestion that the mood among staff must be one of depression. “To be absolutely honest with you, it isn’t. The things that are going on in the wider world do put this kind of thing into some perspective.“This is going to be an extremely busy time for the team because we’ve got to make about 10,000 phone calls, make sure all customers are communicated with and understand what’s happening. At least we have the aspiration to run the races and deliver something for the industry. The mood is pretty positive, actually.”While no corks will be popped in the stands, running the races would be of benefit to jockeys, trainers, owners and fans isolated at home in need of entertainment, not to mention punters and bookmakers. It would also provide the bloodstock industry with its essential annual insight into which animals are worth breeding from. “A lot of these races need to be run if we can,” Smith said. “We are a racecourse, that is our raison d’etre.”The Royal meeting is insured but there are uninsured costs, so Ascot is facing what it describes as “a challenging year” which will affect its finances significantly. Prize money levels will have to be reduced, even if the races are staged.“There will clearly be a material impact on prize money,” Smith said. “That’s the reality for, I think, all races that are going to be run this year. That’s the landscape we’ll have to operate in. But it is better, I’m sure, to run the Pattern races for the good of the breed and the breeding industry, for TV and betting, than not to run the races at all. We’ll do our best but material prize money reductions will be inevitable.”Nor is it being taken for granted that the Royal races will actually be staged, even behind closed doors, given the current uncertainties. “There’s no way of knowing,” Smith acknowledged. “Governmental advice will be clear and so will the British Horseracing Authority’s interpretation of that advice. We will operate within that advice and be happy to do so.”Earlier, the Jockey Club said it would have to postpone its Classic races to provide certainty to trainers of possible contenders. “Trainers need to know whether to step up preparations for their Guineas horses or put that on pause for a later date,” said Amy Starkey, who runs Newmarket. “The future is too uncertain at the moment and there is no opportunity for any preparation races before such important contests for the 2020 Classic generation.”It means that some of the most important horse races are now in a dateless limbo, as officials must wait to learn when the sport can make some sort of return to action. Only then will it be possible to identify new dates for the two Guineas races, the Derby and the Oaks, generation-defining contests which will be saved even if it means running them months out of their usual slots."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dabb3b47f526903490b20e44da2e1f0e4b86526/0_41_6000_3600/master/6000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b436f7d57cfe63a0556b3350eb40d1c","title":"closing uk parks and public spaces tipping point coronavirus covid 19","story":"There is always compromise, always managed space – but banning exercise in this country would be a disasterYou can take our pubs and our shopping centres. You can wall us up behind the front door with Netflix and newsagent wine. But don’t take away our glimpse of the sky, that prescribed 30 minutes of brain-soothing, body-stretching exercise.Judging by the experiences of Spain, Italy and France, this is the next stage for the UK. Quite how long we can put off a complete ban on personal exercise is open to question. But a concerted effort is required here because, with the weather this week forecast to reach as a high as 23C, this really could be a tipping point.Public pressure suggests it’s coming. One of the most heartening aspects of the period of confinement has been a shared counter-commentary, the feeling, expressed often from the fringes, that this might just be a chance to reset and restart, to remake our world as a kinder, gentler place.It remains to be seen quite how this fits with the sheer effort of will required to ensure the No 1 UK trending Twitter topic on Sunday night was #selfishpricks, a response to the suspicion too many people had given in to weakness, cabin fever and springtime muscle memory and gone out to run or walk or lie around in public space.By Monday morning the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had rowed back a little on the veiled threat to enforce a ban on outdoor exercise. But this in itself should be taken with a pinch of salt, at a time when nothing is off the table, no policy is fixed, and nothing that seemed extreme on Sunday night can be ruled out by Wednesday morning.Make no mistake. When this does come, when parks and public spaces are finally closed, it will be one of the most destructive side-effects of this pandemic to date. A disaster for physical and mental health a disaster for sport at recreational and junior levels and a disaster for the trajectory of both the national health and its keeper, the National Health Service.There are two issues here. First, how serious is this problem really? Our cities are crowded places. Many people have no outdoor space at all. It is impossible to stay out of one another’s sight completely. No doubt there is a hardcore of the ill-informed, the antisocial and those who just won’t or can’t obey the rules. These groups should be ruthlessly policed. But most people do understand how to protect themselves.Jogging two metres from anyone else, dodging off the pavement, being aware at all times of your distance: these are habits the average citizen is learning to keep. One person’s enraging iPhone pic of a crowded park scene is another’s intricate network of carefully maintained personal spaces. Mainly, though, the prospect of a ban on outdoor exercise must be taken on its own terms. Any decision on public governance is a balance of cost and benefits. This one would be catastrophic for so many people.It is a mark of how perverse the situation is that the same department of health currently ordering the nation to stay inside was publishing advice in October 2019 urging us to do exactly the opposite. Public Health England’s paper states that “physical inactivity is responsible for one in six UK deaths and is estimated to cost the UK £7.4bn annually”.Yes, you read that right: one in six deaths. Inactivity is not a neutral state. It also has a profound cost. Loss of movement and physical activity is both habit‑forming and often irrecoverable for those of advanced age. Plus there is the more immediate effect on the nation’s mental health. The same government paper concludes: “Physical activity has significant benefits for health, both physical and mental, and can help to prevent and manage over 20 chronic conditions and diseases, including ... depression.”But then, we don’t need a study to tell us this. As long ago as the European plagues of the middle ages, green space and fresh air were being prescribed as balms to melancholia. Sport, exercise, sunlight: these are a form of preventative care for many people who experience mental health problems or skate close to the edge. Removing access to these things will come with a huge hidden cost.But it is also about sport and exercise, the absence of which hits young people hardest. As the government’s own report states: “There is strong evidence that regular physical activity is associated with numerous health benefits for children.” This stretches from teenagers whose physicality demands that, like dogs, they need to run around at least once a day, to those who benefit from being steered away from isolation.Sports science suggests there are permanent physical benefits to physical exertion in your growth years. Something irrecoverable will be lost when that right to exercise is taken away. It is a cost that will be felt by some more than others. Data suggests children from low‑income backgrounds are already less physically active than those from wealthier backgrounds, and three times more likely to be obese by the age of 11.Confinement seems likely to supercharge this process, to further politicise exercise and the outdoors. If you have a garden, or space at home, or a parent with resources already engaged in curating your recreation, you will most likely find a way to continue that. For others the lockdown will mean chronic, often cramped inactivity.What, then, is the alternative? There are plenty of mitigating options the government could look at before that point is reached. Policing public spaces more aggressively is one thing. But why not attack it from a better angle? Do we really want to be a nation that bans exercise before it bans smoking and the sale of tobacco? Surely better to ban eating or drinking alcohol in public if you really want to disperse the wrong kind of crowd? At another extreme, how about making everyone wear masks or a face covering in public?It is here that ideas of freedom and responsibility start to collide. Our social existence is built around things that restrict or funnel our access to the land around us, from street furniture, to rights of way and public spaces. There is always compromise, always managed space. How far the public is able to police its own use of it right now might just dictate how long that vital freedom can be retained."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b169a0b3b992468ebfde8e7bf1ef2f62819f3ab1/563_241_2327_1396/master/2327.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e9f23e4975db1b25a897a80ef27be64","title":"incontinence how women are regaining bladder control","story":"Conversation around the side-effects of menopause is changing thanks to celebrities speaking out – so why do we still avoid talking about bladder weakness?Night sweats, mood swings – language around the menopause is all rather negative and even, some might say, derogatory. It implies it’s a time of things “winding down”, “ending”, “drying up”.Well, most things. Because often, along with menopause, comes bladder weakness. And for many women that means that things get decidedly less dry.Unlike when a girl starts her period, which in many cultures is celebrated, and in the UK is now respected with a government campaign to provide sanitary products in schools, when a woman’s periods begin to end, it’s seen as a change towards old age, towards a body that’s “done”. And even for those going through menopause, it has often felt pretty taboo to talk about the daily problems – especially bladder weakness.“Don’t make me laugh, I’ll wet myself!” might seem like an age-old joke, but it’s one that’s true for menopausal women. And when it comes to our sex lives, it’s no laughing matter. There’s fear and shame and women shut down, choosing not to be intimate for fear of leaking urine during a passionate moment.After all, when do you slip “I’d love to have an early night but I’m worried I’ll wet the bed!” into the conversation, whether you’re with a long-term partner or someone new?The good news is this conversation is being reclaimed by women in the spotlight, who are starting to talk about the final menopause taboo of bladder weakness. Well, we talk so much about starting our periods – why would we not talk about stopping them, and how this affects your love life?It seems there has been a realisation that no matter whether you grace the red carpet and TV screens or you’re on the school run with grandchildren or off to the office, menopause will happen to every woman. Take Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, who released a video for her wellbeing site Goop, saying: “I think menopause gets a really bad rap, and needs a bit of rebranding.” Her video Madame Ovary spoke about mood swings and sweats, while British actress Emma Thompson has joked how hot sweats mean she’s not cold on the red carpet.OK, so the conversation is shifting – just like we can now see a tampon string in a TV ad (thanks to Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign), women are no longer sitting quietly while they deal with the side effects of menopause. But there is one subject that still has to work hard to find its way into our vocabulary – bladder weakness.We can talk hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings – all with increasing honesty. But then there’s Nadia Sawalha, who struggled with incontinence in silence. The usually outspoken TV presenter kept quiet about bladder weakness until she was forced to speak about it after having an accident on national TV.Why is it the one part of menopause women can’t talk about? Well, leaking during the day is one thing – the embarrassment of needing to find some alternative underwear, for example – but when it comes to sex, it’s a different matter altogether. Women who have bladder weakness and might have an accident during sex are likely to close off to their partner, so worried they’ll spoil the intimacy that they don’t have sex and even make up excuses, or “blame” menopause. Intimacy is not synonymous with leakage.After all, when you’re not sure whether you might lose control of your bladder, being intimate isn’t always top of the list. Talk about mixed messages! Women are encouraged to embrace their ageing, to love who they are and how they look – to go grey with glamour and grace, or to wear a bikini with pride. Just don’t mention the bladder weakness, right?!As periods end and change, we have to adjust. The problem is, the world doesn’t seem to adjust with us. And women are left in a strange quagmire of going through something so natural and even primal in silence and, often, shame.And with two-thirds of women over 40 affected with bladder weakness, and many revealing it has affected their mental health, it’s time we became more open and honest about how bladder weakness affects us.Meg Matthews, who has been campaigning about the menopause and runs megsmenopause, says: “Bladder weakness, also called bladder incontinence, is a very common consequence of menopause. It’s not easy to talk about this topic, and, because women don’t always feel confident talking about it, they can feel alone. We need to understand that having bladder weakness is OK. This is the message we need to spread.”But just like when we’re younger, confidence can come back when we use the right products. Once a girl knows she can use a tampon or pad, she’s less worried about her period affecting her day-to-day life. And for women with bladder issues, it’s about a pad that can help you forget there’s even a problem. Then you’ll feel freer to have those more difficult intimacy conversations that you’ve been putting off – and perhaps that early night …As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

The Asia-Pacific region accounts for labour equivalent to 125 million workers lost in the second quarter, although Chinese companies have resumed after a long lockdown, the report said.The ILO did not project precisely how many workers would be made jobless by the crisis, though it said it would be “significantly higher” than the 25 million it forecast just last month. At the start of this year, 190 million workers were unemployed around the world.Sangheon Lee, director of ILO’s employment policy department and the report’s main author, said the crisis’s impact was immediate.“We started to see huge numbers in job loss claims, in the US, Canada and most of the European countries,” Lee said.“We expect that unless we have serious and immediate actions taken right now the recovery is going to be rather long and painful.”The four sectors hardest-hit worldwide, according to the report, are:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed24c56f616dbf34378b3a795d4ff0cefc31938c/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fe85dee0768d33c70304eaee0233ad1","title":"how can coronavirus models get it so wrong","story":"Analysis depends on data – so predictions for Italy and Spain, where peak has passed, are more reliable than for UKThe Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle, based at the University of Washington, is the best organisation in the world at collecting data on diseases and mapping out why we fall ill.Its Global Burden of Disease study is a massive collaborative effort that is valued and used in every country. But even for such an organisation, predicting what will happen to us all as a result of Covid-19 is a tricky business.Crucially, modelling or any other analysis depends on the data that can be gathered. Inevitably, the IHME has better data for the likely outcomes of Covid-19 in Italy and Spain, where the epidemics have peaked, than for the UK, its director, Dr Christopher Murray, says. The margins for the organisation’s predictions of daily deaths in the UK are big – a tenfold variation from 800 to 8,000 near the peak which, it predicts, will happen around 17 April.The IHME will be inputting new data on deaths, which it says are a better indicator of what is going on every day than are cases. That means the margins will shrink and the predictions become firmer as time goes on.This is a different type of model from that of the Imperial College London group advising the government, because it will constantly evolve. But even the Imperial modellers had to change their predictions some weeks ago. Famously, their changed advice persuaded the government to bring in physical distancing guidance, with towns closed for business and people staying home to reduce what, it had suddenly become apparent, would be an unacceptably high death toll.One moment the prime minister, Boris Johnson, was asking people with symptoms to stay home for seven days a few days later, he had ordered a lockdown. What changed was data from Italy’s experience of the pandemic, in which more people were critically ill than anticipated, and from the NHS about its inability to cope if the same should happen in the UK.Models are only as good as the data that goes into them. As time goes on, we will learn a lot more about the outcomes of this pandemic in countries around the world and the effectiveness of policies in mitigating the worst outcomes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edb817845a9aac8512a56f023dd5e57271b3052e/128_214_2532_1520/master/2532.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82d28a7bdc861852e2dbbe08bf7b3309","title":"in the mood for love hong kongs middle aged pandas rediscover their mojo","story":"Captive animals had previously shown little inclination to mate, and scientists are hopeful it may result in pregnancyA middle-aged couple of giant pandas in a Hong Kong theme park have mated for the first time in more than 10 years, after finally enjoying a period of privacy thanks to the coronavirus lockdown.Ying Ying and Le Le have been at Ocean Park since 2007 but, despite the encouragement of zookeepers, they had shown little inclination to have sex while daily hordes of visitors were watching their every move.Chinese scientists, after losing patience with natural breeding, extracted sperm from Le Le and artificially inseminated Ying Ying, but this resulted in miscarriages. When the pandemic forced the closure of the park on 26 January, the 14-year-olds were halfway through the panda’s average life and almost a decade past the start of sexual maturity.But, after more than two months of being alone together, the couple have recently shown signs they were in the mood for love. Local reports say Ying Ying – in her oestrogen cycle – spent more time in the water and Le Le left more scent markings around the enclosure.On Monday morning, the pair were seen cuddling more intensely than usual and then finally did what comes naturally, much to the delight of park managers.“The successful natural mating process today is extremely exciting for all of us, as the chance of pregnancy via natural mating is higher than by artificial insemination,” Michael Boos, executive director for zoological operations and conservation at Ocean Park, noted in a press release.It is not yet clear if Li Li is pregnant but vets say hormone fluctuations and behavioural changes may give a clue by late June. “We hope to bear wonderful pregnancy news to Hong Kongers this year,” Boos said.He said a panda cub would contribute to the conservation of a vulnerable species. Once the lockdown ends, such a popular draw could also rescue the tourist resort, which has recently reported financial difficulties.The commercially-oriented park made no mention of the likelihood that the pandas were finally able to breed thanks to reduced stress from intrusive crowds. Instead it said the animals’ “success” was attributable to years of “trial and learning”, and the collaboration of experts from the Hong Kong park and the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong.Zoologists have long argued the panda’s reputation for a low sex drive was misleading because it was based solely on captive animals.“The problems often attributed to them – short penises, narrow vaginas and low sex drives – are not an issue in the wild,” Jim Harkness, a panda expert and the former China representative for WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature), said. “It is a phoney issue to say that pandas face a breeding crisis that we have to solve.”He said the best way to protect the endangered species was to extend its habitat in the wild."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06467716c901faa46ea64a8b8e218f243b894e8c/0_234_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a31a73cdf1492b6e871108c07c70d86e","title":"liberation as wuhans coronavirus lockdown ends after 76 days","story":"Flights resume, families reunite, and traffic jams return to the streets where 11m people had been shut inAfter 76 days sealed off from the world, the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus pandemic began, has opened its doors again.At midnight on Wednesday, authorities allowed residents to leave the city for the first time since 23 January when 11 million people were put under lockdown to contain the quickly spreading coronavirus.“It’s like being liberated,” said Zhang Kaizhong, 51, who was in his car among rows of vehicles waiting on a motorway leading east out of Wuhan, towards the neighbouring province of Jiangsu. Zhang had come to Wuhan to visit his son the day before the lockdown was announced with only a few hours’ notice. He had not seen his wife for more than 70 days. “I miss her very much,” he said. “Of course I am very excited.”Others said they were rushing to go back to work, going home to attend a funeral or trying to avoid the inevitable rush of vehicles on Wednesday morning when traffic resumes.“I should have been back much earlier,” said Lu, 36, who was on his way back to Shenzhen in the south where he works. He has stayed at home for the last three months. “After all this time, Wuhan has finally been opened,” he said.City officials have worked to make an event of the city’s reopening, with a light show, social media campaigns led by state media, and special events to mark the reopening of the airports, stations and factories. Train and bus terminals were decorated with lights. Skyscrapers in the city centre were lit up with the words: “Hello, Wuhan”.Online, internet users posted hourly countdowns to midnight while some reflected on their time shut indoors, under government orders. “Achievements during the lockdown: lost 10kg, read two books, tried a haircut I would never have dared, slept eight hours every day. Next stage: lose more weight, get into the mindset of returning to society,” wrote one commentator on Weibo.“‘Wuhan lockdown lifted.’ Seeing these words almost makes me want to cry,” wrote a second. “After so much struggle, our Wuhan will return,” another posted.China Eastern said it was operating 30 flights from Wuhan to other cities in China, like Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, with more than 1,600 trips booked. More than 55,000 passengers have booked tickets to leave the city, according to the railway operator. Long-distance buses have also resumed service.Over the last few weeks, the city has been gradually easing the lockdown by allowing some residents to leave their residential compounds on a limited basis. On Wednesday, more businesses are to reopen and all residents with green “health codes” and documents from their employers should be able to return to work.On Tuesday evening, cars parked along the streets – empty for months – were moved as people expected normal traffic to resume. Inner city public bus services also reopened, and residents expected morning rush hour to return with commuters crowding public transport on Wednesday.Wuhan’s lockdown was an unprecedented measure soon emulated by surrounding cities and counties, putting an estimated 56 million people in Hubei province under de facto quarantine. As the virus has spread globally and new cases in China have dropped dramatically, Chinese officials say the strategy was justified.The policy has been credited with slowing down the spread of the virus by forcing social distancing and limiting transmission between Hubei and other parts of the country.But the lockdown has also been criticised as a draconian measure of last resort, taken only because authorities waited too long and suppressed early warnings. According to official figures, more than 2,500 people in the city have died from the virus, but some residents believe the true figure is likely to be higher.“The situation is not as good as what is being reported,” said Yao, 41, a resident in Wuhan, who said that few of her friends believe the reported number of deaths and infections. Many residents are also worried about the number of asymptomatic infections as the city returns to work.Other measures remain in place – a sign authorities do not believe the epidemic is completely over. Some residents said their residential compounds, after starting to allow residents to leave, had tightened restrictions again but did not explain why.Colleges, primary and secondary schools, vocational schools, technical colleges and nursery schools are still closed. Officials said in a notice on Tuesday that the opening date would be “decided after evaluation of prevention efforts”.Authorities are still asking residents to limit outings and not to attend large gatherings. Many residential compounds remain closed off, with strict checks at gates, guarded by local security.

Jobs relying on air links were predominantly in countries dependent on tourism, but supply chains for high-value manufacturing were also affected, Iata said.Virgin Atlantic is the most prominent UK carrier that has applied for direct government aid, opening its books to the Treasury as it hopes for up to £500m in loans and credit guarantees.Heaton-Harris would not confirm how many airlines were in contact with the government for state aid. But he said the government was “in very detailed dialogue” with companies, including firms from other parts of the aviation industry such as airports and suppliers.He said the government would not rule out taking a stake in airlines that had appealed for Treasury help, saying: “Everything is on the table … We want to ensure this sector thrives.”Air passengers and suppliers however have complained that they risk bearing the brunt of relief measures as Iata pushed for alterations to rules on refunds, allowing airlines to issue vouchers rather than repaying fares.The consumer association Which? has accused travel agents of breaking the law by not refunding passengers, and denounced Abta, the travel association, for advising travel agents to issue credit notes instead. However, Abta has said its members face bankruptcy and are unable to return cash to holidaymakers because airlines are stalling on refunds.According to Iata, airlines have collectively already used $35bn (£28bn) of their $61bn cash reserves with most fleets grounded due to the pandemic.Alexandre de Juniac, the director general of Iata, defended the use of vouchers: “Refunding is almost an unbearable task, financially speaking … We were perfectly conscious of the difficulty for the passenger, but it was a matter of survival for us.”European governments have also agreed to defer until 2021 air traffic control fees amounting to about €1.1bn (£1bn) in a bid to assist airlines, for which De Juniac said the sector was profoundly thankful.However, the move prompted Canso, which represents air traffic control businesses, to demand a rescue package for its sector, saying the decision posed a “significant financial challenge”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05ba4933a9a748174f4cbf4ee072a874bdbfde14/0_96_2880_1728/master/2880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c91164e1306d3b55f7b0bbb632069a1","title":"uruguay to repatriate australian passengers from covid 19 stricken ship","story":"Australian cruise vessel reported to have carried 128 people who tested positive The Greg Mortimer has been anchored 20km (12 miles) off the coast of Uruguay since 27 March, but authorities in the South American country had until now refused to allow passengers off.On Tuesday, the ship’s operator, Aurora Expeditions, said that of 132 passengers and 85 crew, 128 people had tested positive for Covid-19. Most on board are understood to be Australian, although there are also citizens of New Zealand, the US and the UK.“We found a ship where almost everyone has been infected,” said Karina Rando, one of 21 Uruguayan doctors dispatched to the ship. “We’ve done our utmost to prevent our own infection. Most of the passengers are well.”Many of those who tested positive are still asymptomatic, but could still be at risk, said Rando.“There are many patients over 70 years of age, some of them with other chronic conditions such as heart and lung diseases,” she said. “Those patients may fall seriously ill tomorrow even if they looked well today.”The ship set out on 15 March from the Argentinian port of Ushuaia, the southernmost city in the world. It was to have undertaken a 16-day cruise to Antarctica and South Georgia, christened “In Shackleton’s Footsteps” after the Irish polar explorer, Ernest Shackleton.Symptoms of coronavirus started to appear soon after departure, and the ship erted to the Uruguayan capital Montevideo. Even the ship’s doctor fell ill with a fever and was left unable to perform his duties.“We have made it clear that the ill health and the isolation of the crew is making it difficult to maintain the same standard of essential services onboard,” Aurora Expeditions told passengers on 2 April.Uruguay denied permission for the ship to dock, and also refused to allow passengers or crew to disembark.That decision was eventually reversed at the weekend, when a Uruguayan naval vessel was dispatched to the Greg Mortimer to remove six gravely ill passengers and take them to the British Hospital in Montevideo.On Saturday the Uruguayan navy tweeted a video of a passenger – reportedly a British woman with pneumonia in both lungs – leaping from the moving cruise ship to the military vessel to be taken to hospital in the Uruguayan capital.“The people on the ship are calm but they are eager to go home,” Marcelo Girard, a doctor at a Uruguayan medical facility where two people from the cruise ship are being treated, told the AP.Passengers from Australia and New Zealand will board an emergency flight bound for Melbourne on Thursday, Uruguayan authorities confirmed on Tuesday afternoon.The cost per passenger is about US$9,300 and the cruise ship operator has asked the Australian government for help with expenses. On landing, the passengers will undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine.Uruguay has 406 confirmed cases of coronavirus and has had six deaths."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab356414344fb08f342a3c72ca10fc7facccd1cf/0_298_5568_3341/master/5568..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c9c1e3a6744fe33c7cb053706b13828","title":"we are very afraid scramble contain coronavirus mumbai slum dharavi","story":"Fears disease could ‘spread like wildfire’ in the incredibly congested slum of DharaviIt was the news that many in India had feared. A 56-year-old man who lived in Dharavi, India’s largest slum, where almost 1 million people are densely packed together in a 2 sq km area in Mumbai, had tested positive for coronavirus. He died shortly after.It has prompted a scramble by local authorities to halt the virus before it takes hold in this overcrowded, unsanitary enclave, which was the inspiration for Danny Boyle’s film Slumdog Millionaire.But the prospect of attempting to contain transmission in a place where 10 people often live in a single room, more than 80 people share a public toilet and where many houses do not even have running water is already proving daunting to local officials. So far there are five known cases in Dharavi, while 25 people have been taken into special quarantine facilities and another 3,500 placed under home quarantine.“We are doing everything we can to make sure it does not explode and that there is no community spread, but it is a big challenge to contain this,” said Kiran Dighavkar, the assistant municipal commissioner for G-North ward of Mumbai.It appears that the 56-year-old garment worker who was the slum’s first victim had made two trips to the local Lokmanya Tilak municipal general hospital over the course of a week, presenting first with a fever and then severe respiratory problems, before he was tested by doctors. With no foreign travel history, he had not been considered high risk. But on 29 March, he tested positive for the virus and died four days later.There was initial confusion over how this man, who had never been abroad and lived with seven family members in a small flat adjacent to Dharavi, could possibly have contracted the virus. Yet while his family were initially uncooperative, it later emerged he had hosted several men who had attended a religious gathering of the Tablighi Jamaat, an Islamic movement, in Delhi several weeks ago, which has since been linked to hundreds of coronavirus cases across India.The response by the authorities was swift. The area where the victim had lived was sealed off and remains so, and his family was taken into quarantine and all those in the building, or who were considered high risk, have been tested. A new 51-bed hospital in the Dharavi area, specifically to treat coronavirus patients, has also been acquired, with eight intensive care beds, though it is feared if the virus takes hold this will not be nearly enough.Other cases in the slum include a 30-year-old woman with no foreign travel history, and authorities are searching for the dozens who attended her birthday party a week ago.“There are already many health issues in Dharavi,” said Dighavkar, who added that one of the main obstacles in tackling the spread of coronavirus was a social stigma that prevented people from coming forward with symptoms.“But we are hopeful that they have good immunity because they have been exposed to many viruses, especially through using the community toilet, so we are hoping that if we find the high-risk contacts and put them in quarantine, we will be able to control it.”Babbu Khan, a municipal councillor in Dharavi, said he feared many more people were already infected and warned that undetected cases could “wreak havoc” in the slum, where the disease was likely to “spread like wildfire”.“For the slum-dwellers it is very difficult to stay safe from a coronavirus-infected neighbour in this incredibly congested slum of Dharavi,” said Khan. “When five people have already tested positive for the virus, there must be many more people around who are already infected. We know that many people carrying the virus remain asymptomatic, but still continue to spread the infection.”Overall Mumbai has one of the highest concentrations of coronavirus cases in the country and on Monday, three doctors and 26 nurses of Wockhardt hospital in Mumbai tested positive, bringing the total number of cases in the state of Maharashtra to 809.Within Dharavi, fear has already begun to take hold. Mohammad Shafi Alam Shaikh, 53, who trades in school bags and lives in the MP Nagar area of Dharavi along with his wife and four children, said many people were very scared about the “new disease”.“Many of my neighbours are very nervous and staying indoors,” he said. “They are coming out of their homes only to use public toilets. All of them say that it is very difficult to escape the infection in such congested slums. They all are afraid of being infected.”Many mosques in the slum are using their public announcement system to spread awareness about Covid-19. But Shaikh said most of the advised measures for hand-washing and social distancing were an impossibility for the people of Dharavi.“Many people do not have food at home and so in search of provisions and food handouts, people are being forced to stay outside their homes for a long time. At places like ration shops and free food delivery points people are still gathering in big numbers,” said Shaikh. “So we are very afraid of a fast spread of the virus.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bda74d598f84abf4e4f682650ea6f7059d43a44b/0_195_4368_2621/master/4368..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a6ee343364cce21bc2aacae7aa7151e","title":"what coronavirus can teach us about hope rebecca solnit","story":"In the midst of fear and isolation, we are learning that profound, positive change is possible. By  Rebecca SolnitDisasters begin suddenly and never really end. The future will not, in crucial ways, be anything like the past, even the very recent past of a month or two ago. Our economy, our priorities, our perceptions will not be what they were at the outset of this year. The particulars are startling: companies such as GE and Ford retooling to make ventilators, the scramble for protective gear, once-bustling city streets becoming quiet and empty, the economy in freefall. Things that were supposed to be unstoppable stopped, and things that were supposed to be impossible – extending workers’ rights and benefits, freeing prisoners, moving a few trillion dollars around in the US – have already happened.The word “crisis” means, in medical terms, the crossroads a patient reaches, the point at which she will either take the road to recovery or to death. The word “emergency” comes from “emergence” or “emerge”, as if you were ejected from the familiar and urgently need to reorient. The word “catastrophe” comes from a root meaning a sudden overturning.We have reached a crossroads, we have emerged from what we assumed was normality, things have suddenly overturned. One of our main tasks now – especially those of us who are not sick, are not frontline workers, and are not dealing with other economic or housing difficulties – is to understand this moment, what it might require of us, and what it might make possible.A disaster (which originally meant “ill-starred”, or “under a bad star”) changes the world and our view of it. Our focus shifts, and what matters shifts. What is weak breaks under new pressure, what is strong holds, and what was hidden emerges. Change is not only possible, we are swept away by it. We ourselves change as our priorities shift, as intensified awareness of mortality makes us wake up to our own lives and the preciousness of life. Even our definition of “we” might change as we are separated from schoolmates or co-workers, sharing this new reality with strangers. Our sense of self generally comes from the world around us, and right now, we are finding another version of who we are.As the pandemic upended our lives, people around me worried that they were having trouble focusing and being productive. It was, I suspected, because we were all doing other, more important work. When you’re recovering from an illness, pregnant or young and undergoing a growth spurt, you’re working all the time, especially when it appears you’re doing nothing. Your body is growing, healing, making, transforming and labouring below the threshold of consciousness. As we struggled to learn the science and statistics of this terrible scourge, our psyches were doing something equivalent. We were adjusting to the profound social and economic changes, studying the lessons disasters teach, equipping ourselves for an unanticipated world.The first lesson a disaster teaches is that everything is connected. In fact, disasters, I found while living through a medium-sized one (the 1989 earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area) and later writing about major ones (including 911, Hurricane Katrina and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and Fukushima nuclear catastrophe in Japan), are crash courses in those connections. At moments of immense change, we see with new clarity the systems – political, economic, social, ecological – in which we are immersed as they change around us. We see what’s strong, what’s weak, what’s corrupt, what matters and what doesn’t.I often think of these times as akin to a spring thaw: it’s as if the pack ice has broken up, the water starts flowing again and boats can move through places they could not during winter. The ice was the arrangement of power relations that we call the status quo – it seems to be stable, and those who benefit from it often insist that it’s unchangeable. Then it changes fast and dramatically, and that can be exhilarating, terrifying, or both.Those who benefit most from the shattered status quo are often more focused on preserving or reestablishing it than protecting human life – as we saw when a chorus of US conservatives and corporate top dogs insisted that, for the sake of the stock market, everyone had to go back to work, and that the resultant deaths would be an acceptable price to pay. In a crisis, the powerful often try to seize more power – as they have in this round, with the Trump Department of Justice looking at suspending constitutional rights – and the rich seek more riches: two Republican senators are under fire for allegedly using inside information about the coming pandemic to make a profit in the stock market (although both have denied wrongdoing).Disaster scholars use the term “elite panic” to describe the ways that elites react when they assume that ordinary people will behave badly. When elites describe “panic” and “looting” in the streets, these are usually misnomers for ordinary people doing what they need to do to survive or care for others. Sometimes it’s wise to move rapidly from danger sometimes it’s altruistic to gather supplies to share.Such elites often prioritise profit and property over human life and community. In the days after a huge earthquake struck San Francisco on 18 April 1906, the US military swarmed over the city, convinced that ordinary people were a threat and a source of disorder. The mayor issued a “shoot to kill” proclamation against looters, and the soldiers believed they were restoring order. What they were actually doing was setting inexpert firebreaks that helped fire spread through the city, and shooting or beating citizens who disobeyed orders (sometimes those orders were to let the fires burn down their own homes and neighbourhoods). Ninety-nine years later, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans’s police and white vigilantes did the same thing: shooting black people in the name of defending property and their own authority. The local, state and federal government insisted on treating a stranded, mostly poor, mostly black population as dangerous enemies to be contained and controlled, rather than victims of a catastrophe to be aided.The mainstream media colluded in obsessing about looting in the aftermath of Katrina. The stock of mass-manufactured goods in large corporate chain stores seemed to matter more than people needing food and clean water, or grandmothers left clinging to roofs. Nearly 1,500 people died of a disaster that had more to do with bad government than with bad weather. The US Army Corps of Engineers’ levees had failed the city had no evacuation plans for the poor, and President George W Bush’s administration failed to deliver prompt and effective relief. The same calculus is happening now. A member of the Brazilian opposition said of Brazil’s rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro: “He represents the most perverse economic interests that couldn’t care less about people’s lives. They’re worried about maintaining their profitability.” (Bolsonaro claims he is trying to protect workers and the economy.)The billionaire evangelist who owns the arts and crafts chain Hobby Lobby claimed ine guidance in keeping his workers at their jobs when businesses were ordered to close. (The company has now closed all its stores.) At Uline Corporation, owned by billionaire Trump backers Richard and Liz Uihlein, a memo sent to Wisconsin workers said: “please do NOT tell your peers about the symptoms \u0026amp your assumptions. By doing so, you are causing unnecessary panic in the office.” The billionaire founder and chairman of payroll processing corporation Paychex, Tom Golisano, said: “The damages of keeping the economy closed as it is could be worse than losing a few more people.” (Golisano has since said his comments were misrepresented, and has apologised.)Historically, there have always been titans of industry who prized the lifeless thing that is profit over living beings, who paid bribes in order to operate unhindered, worked children to death or put labourers in mortal danger in sweatshops and coal mines. There were also those who pressed on with fossil fuel extraction and burning despite what they knew, or refused to know, about climate change. One of the primary uses of wealth has always been to buy your way out of the common fate, or, at least, it has come with a belief that you can disassociate from society at large. And while the rich are often conservative, conservatives more often align with the rich, whatever their economic status.The idea that everything is connected is an affront to conservatives who cherish a macho every-man-for-himself frontier fantasy. Climate change has been a huge insult to them – this science that says what comes out of our cars and chimneys shapes the fate of the world in the long run and affects crops, sea level, forest fires and so much more. If everything is connected, then the consequences of every choice and act and word have to be examined, which we see as love in action and they see as impingement upon absolute freedom, freedom being another word for absolutely no limits on the pursuit of self-interest. Ultimately, a significant portion of conservatives and corporate leaders regard science as an annoyance that they can refuse to recognise. Some insist they can choose whatever rules and facts they want, as though these too are just free-market commodities to pick and choose from or remake according to one’s whims. “This denial of science and critical thinking among religious ultraconservatives now haunts the American response to the coronavirus crisis,” wrote the journalist Katherine Stewart in the New York Times.Our rulers showed little willingness to recognise the ominous possibilities of the pandemic in the US, the UK, Brazil and many other countries. They failed in their most important job, and denying that failure will be a major focus for them. And while it may be inevitable that the pandemic will result in an economic crash, it is also turning into an opportunity for authoritarian power grabs in the Philippines, Hungary, Israel and the US – a reminder that the largest problems are still political, and so are their solutions.When a storm subsides, the air is washed clean of whatever particulate matter has been obscuring the view, and you can often see farther and more sharply than at any other time. When this storm clears, we may, as do people who have survived a serious illness or accident, see where we were and where we should go in a new light. We may feel free to pursue change in ways that seemed impossible while the ice of the status quo was locked up. We may have a profoundly different sense of ourselves, our communities, our systems of production and our future.For many of us in the developed world, what has changed most immediately is spatial. We have stayed home, those of us who have homes, and away from contact with others. We have withdrawn from schools, workplaces, conferences, vacations, gyms, errands, parties, bars, clubs, churches, mosques, synagogues, from the busyness and bustle of everyday life. The philosopher-mystic Simone Weil once wrote to a faraway friend: “Let us love this distance, which is thoroughly woven with friendship, since those who do not love each other are not separated.” We have withdrawn from each other to protect each other. And people have found ways to help the vulnerable, despite the need to remain physically distant.My friend Renato Redentor Constantino, a climate campaigner, wrote to me from the Philippines, and said: “We are witness today to daily displays of love that remind us of the many reasons why humans have survived this long. We encounter epic acts of courage and citizenship each day in our neighbourhoods and in other cities and countries, instances that whisper to us that the depredations of a few will eventually be overcome by legions of stubborn people who refuse the counsel of despair, violence, indifference and arrogance that so-called leaders appear so eager nowadays to trigger.”When we are no longer trying to unlink ourselves from the chain of a spreading disease, I wonder if we will rethink how we were linked, how we moved about and how the goods we rely on moved about. Perhaps we will appreciate the value of direct face-to-face contact more. Perhaps the Europeans who have sung together from their balconies or applauded together for their medical workers, and the Americans who came out to sing or dance on their suburban blocks, will have a different sense of belonging. Perhaps we will find a new respect for the workers who produce our food and those who bring it to our tables.Although staying put is hard, maybe we will be reluctant to resume our rushing about, and something of the stillness now upon us will stay with us. We may rethink the wisdom of having much of our most vital stuff – medicine, medical equipment – made on other continents. We may also rethink the precarious just-in-time supply chains. I have often thought that the wave of privatisation that has characterised our neoliberal age began with the privatisation of the human heart, the withdrawal from a sense of a shared fate and social bonds. It is to be hoped that this shared experience of catastrophe will reverse the process. A new awareness of how each of us belongs to the whole and depends on it may strengthen the case for meaningful climate action, as we learn that sudden and profound change is possible after all.“Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers,” Wordsworth wrote, a little more than 200 years ago. Perhaps this will be the moment that we recognise that there is enough food, clothing, shelter, healthcare and education for all – and that access to these things should not depend on what job you do and whether you earn enough money. Perhaps the pandemic is also making the case, for those who were not already convinced, for universal healthcare and basic income. In the aftermath of disaster, a change of consciousness and priorities are powerful forces.I have found over and over that the proximity of death in shared calamity makes many people more urgently alive, less attached to the small things in life and more committed to the big ones, often including civil society or the common good.I have mostly written about 20th-century disasters, but one analogy a bit further back comes to mind: the Black Death, which wiped out a third of Europe’s population, and, in England, later led to peasant revolts against war taxes and wage caps that were officially quashed, but nevertheless led to more rights and freedoms for peasants and labourers. In the emergency legislation passed in the US in March, many workers gained new sick-leave rights. Lots of things we were assured were impossible – housing the homeless, for example – have come to pass in some places.But often the most significant consequences of disasters are not immediate or direct. The 2008 financial collapse led to 2011’s Occupy Wall Street uprising, which prompted a new reckoning with economic inequality and a new scrutiny of the human impact of exploitative mortgages, student loans, for profit-colleges, health-insurance systems and more, and that in turn amplified the profiles of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, whose ideas have helped pull the Democratic party to the left, towards policies that will make the US fairer and more equal. The conversations stirred by Occupy and its sister movements across the globe incited more critical scrutiny of ruling powers, and more demands for economic justice. Changes in the public sphere originate within the inidual, but also, changes in the world at large affect our sense of self, our priorities and our sense of the possible.We are only in the early stages of this disaster, and we are also in a strange stillness. It is like the Christmas truce of 1914, when German and English soldiers stopped fighting for a day, the guns fell silent and soldiers mingled freely. War itself paused. There’s a way that our getting and spending has been a kind of war against the Earth. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, carbon emissions have plummeted. Reports say the air above Los Angeles, Beijing and New Delhi is miraculously clean. Parks all over the US are shut to visitors, which may have a beneficial effect on wildlife. In the last government shutdown of 2018-2019, elephant seals at Point Reyes National Seashore just north of San Francisco took over a new beach, and now own it for the duration of their season of mating and birthing on land.There’s another analogy that comes to mind. When a caterpillar enters its chrysalis, it dissolves itself, quite literally, into liquid. In this state, what was a caterpillar and will be a butterfly is neither one nor the other, it’s a sort of living soup. Within this living soup are the imaginal cells that will catalyse its transformation into winged maturity. May the best among us, the most visionary, the most inclusive, be the imaginal cells – for now we are in the soup. The outcome of disasters is not foreordained. It’s a conflict, one that takes place while things that were frozen, solid and locked up have become open and fluid – full of both the best and worst possibilities. We are both becalmed and in a state of profound change.But this is also a time of depth for those spending more time at home and more time alone, looking outward at this unanticipated world. We often ide emotions into good and bad, happy and sad, but I think they can equally be ided into shallow and deep, and the pursuit of what is supposed to be happiness is often a flight from depth, from one’s own interior life and the suffering around us – and not being happy is often framed as a failure. But there is meaning as well as pain in sadness, mourning and grief, the emotions born of empathy and solidarity. If you are sad and frightened, it is a sign that you care, that you are connected in spirit. If you are overwhelmed – well, it is overwhelming, and it will take decades of study, analysis, discussion and contemplation to understand how and why 2020 suddenly took us all into marshy new territory.Seven years ago, Patrisse Cullors wrote a sort of mission statement for Black Lives Matter: “Provide hope and inspiration for collective action to build collective power to achieve collective transformation. Rooted in grief and rage but pointed towards vision and dreams.” It is beautiful not only because it is hopeful, not only because then Black Lives Matter set out and did transformative work, but because it acknowledges that hope can coexist with difficulty and suffering. The sadness in the depths and the fury that burns above are not incompatible with hope, because we are complex creatures, because hope is not optimism that everything will be fine regardless.Hope offers us clarity that, amid the uncertainty ahead, there will be conflicts worth joining and the possibility of winning some of them. And one of the things most dangerous to this hope is the lapse into believing that everything was fine before disaster struck, and that all we need to do is return to things as they were. Ordinary life before the pandemic was already a catastrophe of desperation and exclusion for too many human beings, an environmental and climate catastrophe, an obscenity of inequality. It is too soon to know what will emerge from this emergency, but not too soon to start looking for chances to help decide it. It is, I believe, what many of us are preparing to do.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dcac2a6f8a716a0e4c7e2ae689aed23c2288b30/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf598c537a604f6bd21057f62f33c75a","title":"covid 19 what if im immunocompromised","story":"Hannah Devlin speaks to Dr Jenna Macciochi about how our immune systems fight off infections such as coronavirus, and – as per lots of your questions – what happens if we’re immunocompromised"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4223317.1586279034!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bin collectors link household waste surge to coronavirus panic buying","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIt is estimated, in normal circumstances, Irish households throw out between €400 and €1,000 worth of food annually. Photograph: David SleatorBin collection companies are linking a “record” surge in household waste to overbuying at supermarkets during the coronavirus crisis.While people staying in and working from home during the lockdown would be expected to buy more food than usual – given the closure of restaurants, cafes, delis, work and school canteens – waste firms say there has been a noticeable rise in the volume of unused food being dumped.A report from data company Kantar on Monday said that March was the busiest month on record for grocery sales, with fresh food sales up 16 per cent.Greyhound, one of the country’s largest bin collectors with 120,000 customers in Dublin, said it was dealing with “a record 38 per cent increase” in brown bin waste since people began working from home in large numbers and restrictions such as restaurant and cafe closures were announced. This equates to more than 200 tonnes extra.While the brown bins also take garden waste, such as lawn and hedge clippings, Greyhound managing director John Brosnan said there was more unused food being thrown out.“We are seeing a large increase in unopened food waste, which could be the result of panic buying,” he said.Greyhound has also seen a 10 per cent increase in the amount of general waste being put in black bins.Brown binsThe City Bin Company, which operates in Dublin and Galway, said it has seen the amount of brown bin waste collected rise by 68 per cent over the past two weeks. However, managing director Niall Killilea believes garden waste accounted for a significant amount of this increase.“It’s not only the Covid-19 impact. We did have a few days of nice weather and that allowed people get out and mow the grass or trim the hedge, so there is a lot of garden waste in there too,” he said. “But overall, there has been a very noticeable rise in all waste, and in particular from the brown bin.”Mr Killilea said he was more concerned about the increase in black bin waste – up 18 per cent for his company over the past fortnight – as householders are increasingly throwing out packaged and processed food past its sell-by date.“If you have a packet of ham that has gone off, that typically finds its way into the black bin,” he said. “Most people don’t separate out the food waste and separate the hard plastic from soft plastic and a lot of people are still uncomfortable putting cooked and raw meat into the brown bin, unfortunately.”It is estimated, in normal circumstances, Irish households throw out between €400 and €1,000 worth of food annually. With panic buying bringing supermarket sales to record levels and more people preparing food at home a greater proportion of the time due to the restrictions, that figure could rise.Organic wasteFood waste dumped in black bins that end up in landfill sites releases methane, a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Brown bin waste is typically taken to one of Ireland’s 10 or so composting and anaerobic digestion plants.Percy Foster, of Cré, which represents the composting and anaerobic digestion industry, said it would be another two weeks before accurate data was available on the increase in food and other organic waste, but some plants were already seeing a 15 per cent increase in loads.“I would urge caution with this figure as we need more time to see the trend,” he said.Mr Foster said the plants were well able to cope with the rise in household food and organic waste as there had been a “dramatic” decrease in commercial food waste, which is freeing up capacity.Arnold Dillon, of Retail Ireland which represents supermarkets and other grocery outlets, said an “elevation in demand” was down to some “confusion” and “nervousness” over the tightened movement restrictions but that this had since “levelled off”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph:Gareth ChaneyCollinsDublin Zoo has put in place social distancing protocols to ensure its animals are not infected by Covid-19. It follows an incident in New York where a four-year-old female Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo tested positive for the coronavirus. The tiger, named Nadia, was infected by an asymptomatic zoo keeper who did not know he had the virus. The tiger had a dry cough, but had not exhibited other serious symptoms. Three other tigers and three African lions have showed symptoms of the disease in the Bronx Zoo, but have not been tested for it. All the animals are expected to make a full recovery. In a statement Dublin Zoo said none of the felines in its care or any other animals have shown symptoms of respiratory illness. The zoo added: “To ensure the safety of its staff and animals, Dublin Zoo has put in place strict social distancing protocols for the animal care team in line with HSE guidelines. “Precautionary measures have also been taken to safeguard against reverse zoonosis, the transfer of Covid -19 (or indeed other pathogens) from humans to felines or other animals. “Precautions include wearing of appropriate PPE including masks during feeding and cleaning activity, regular disinfection of equipment, and regular hand washing and disinfection.” Scientists believe that Covid-19, along with other coronaviruses such as Sars and Mers, came originally from infected animals.In February, Chinese researchers published an article in Nature that concluded the Covid-19 virus is “96 per cent identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus”. This phenomenon is known as “zoonotic spillover”, but reverse zoonosis is not as well understood. There is no evidence yet of an animal dying from coronavirus contracted from a human . The zoo has been closed since March 12th following the Government announcement that all schools were to close. On March 25th it issued a further statement stating that the zoo will remained closed until April 20th. The zoo said its staff will remain in place during this time to ensure the ongoing continuity of care for the animals.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4223509.1586294329!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus minister to sign regulations giving garda%C3%AD powers to enforce lockdown","story":"Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan has confirmed that a further 36 people have died due to coronavirus, Ireland\u0027s highest daily figure for new deaths. The total number of deaths from coronavirus now stands at 210. Video: RTÉ\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Health Simon Harris said he will sign the regulations on Tuesday night. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Minister for Health Simon Harris will sign regulations on Tuesday night granting the Garda the powers to enforce sweeping restrictions on public movement and bring criminal prosecutions against those failing to comply.The new powers were included in the emergency coronavirus legislation passed two weeks ago but only became active once the Minister signed them into use. Until now gardaí have been requesting rather than ordering people to comply with the guidelines.Mr Harris announced he would activate the regulations following a meeting with the Garda Commissioner and the Attorney General on Tuesday. It is understood signing of the regulations had been delayed as the Government’s lawyers worked out the precise wording and extent of the powers.Gardaí will now have the power to arrest and detain those who breach the restrictions. This includes those found exercising beyond 2km from their homes or those travelling for non-essential reasons.Convictions will result in a maximum sentence of six months in prison and a fine of €2,500.Gardaí will also have the power to assist the HSE in detaining someone judged to be at risk of spreading the virus who refuses to self isolate. Those refusing to comply with such orders face up to three months in prison.The measures were to be enacted on Tuesday amid worries the fine weather will attract many people to public spaces over the coming bank holiday weekend.Garda sources say the intention will be to only use the enforcement powers as a last resort, e.g. if someone refuses to return home when directed or are repeatedly caught breaking the regulations.A Garda spokesman repeated on Tuesday that compliance from the public remains high.Speaking on RTE’s Prime Time Mr Harris said it was important the gardai have these powers “in their back pocket” as a reserve should they need it. The move comes ahead of the Easter Bank Holiday weekend. Earlier on Tuesday the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) made a direct appeal to the public not to travel unnecessarily over Easter.Expressing concern that a proportion of the population may seek to travel to holiday destinations, holiday homes and mobile homes over the Easter weekend, despite travel restrictions in place since March 27th.It said it was grateful gardai have been “visibly present” on the roads over the past week “assisting the public with compliance”.Record daily deathsEarlier the deaths of another 36 patients - 19 males and 17 females - diagnosed with Covid-19 were reported by the NPHET.Some 27 of the deaths were in the east, six in the north and three in the south. Some 24 of the patients were reported as having underlying health conditions. There have now been 210 Covid-19 related deaths in the Republic. The median age of today’s deaths is 81.The NPHET also reported 345 new confirmed cases on Monday. The total number of confirmed cases now stands at 5,709.Tuesday’s number for deaths is a daily record.According to the NPHET, 42,484 tests have been carried out in labs across the country. Almost 40 per cent of tests have been carried out in the last seven days.These tests have resulted in 2,374 positive tests. This means 19 per cent of tests are producing a positive result, up 4 per cent in the past week.Analysis of casesAn analysis of the cases up to last Sunday shows 46 per cent were in men and 53 per cent in women the median age of cases is 48 years. There have been 270 clusters involving 1,103 cases.Of these cases, 1,345 have been hospitalised (24 per cent) and of those hospitalised, 194 were admitted to ICU.A total of 1,338 healthcare workers have now contracted the virus.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said this increase was the result of a more sensitive case definition, which meant people who were more likely to have the disease were tested, including healthcare workers and people in hospital.“Given the mass community transmission of Covid-19 across Europe, the European Centre for Disease Control is expected to advise all EU nationals to keep current restrictions in place.“While current restrictions have reduced the number of people becoming infected by one confirmed case, this depends on people staying at home and following public health advice.” Earlier dataNPHET officials criticised new US research published on Tuesday which suggested Ireland had reached its peak, as unreliable.According to the new international modelling data , Ireland has passed its peak of Covid-19 infections but can expect more than 400 deaths by next month.Peak resource use of hospital and ICU beds passed on April 4th, while peak daily deaths passed on April 6th, according to the data published by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington in the US.The research looks at the predicted spread and impact of coronavirus in 29 European countries and assumes social distancing measures will remain in place until August.“It’s not really a model. It just took existing case data and suggested that because things seem to have stabilised over a short number of days that perhaps we’ve reached a peak,” said assistant chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn.“It doesn’t take into account any changes over the coming days or the highest number of deaths reported this evening.”Dr Glynn said Irish modelling being led by NUI Maynooth president Prof Philip Nolan was using a more extensive range of paramenters and people should wait to see what comes out of this work.Placing “undue store” in the US research could lead to complacency, he warned.The research looks at the predicted spread and impact of coronavirus in 29 European countries and assumes social distancing measures will remain in place until August.It predicts there will be more than 150,000 deaths in Europe during the “first wave” of the pandemic.In relation to Ireland, it says there was “no overall bed shortage” on the peak date, with a shortage of 88 ICU beds. A shortfall of 125 ventilators was also forecast.These calculations were based on the pre-pandemic availability of under 250 ICU beds in the State this capacity has since been at least doubled, indicating an ever greater surplus of capacity under these modelling assumptions.The supply of ventilators has also been boosted.Deaths A total of 401 deaths are forecast in Ireland by the start of May but none thereafter to August 4th, the end of the modelling period, according to the report.The study predicts 66,300 deaths in the UK, the highest in Europe. The UK’s use of bed resources is predicted to peak on April 17th and its deaths on April 20th.It says the peak of the pandemic has passed in many European countries, including Spain, Italy and France, where 19,209, 20,300 and 15,058 deaths are predicted, respectively. The model is based on the social distancing measures introduced in New Zealand and also assumes complete adherence to these measures. It also suggests the end of the first wave of the epidemic could occur by early June and says whether a second wave occurs depends on what is done then to prevent Covid-19 being re-introduced. “By the end of the first wave of the epidemic, an estimated 97 per cent of the population of the US will still be susceptible to the disease and thus measures to avoid a second wave of the pandemic prior to vaccine availability will be necessary.”“It is unequivocally evident that social distancing can, when well implemented and maintained, control the epidemic, leading to declining death rates,” said IHME director Dr Christopher Murray.“Those nations hit hard early on implemented social distancing orders and may have the worst behind them as they are seeing important progress in reducing their death rates. Each nation’s trajectory will change – and dramatically for the worse – if people ease up on social distancing or relax other precautions.“To decrease the risk of a second wave in places where the first wave is controlled by robust social distancing, governments would need to consider mass testing, contact tracing, and quarantines for those infected until a vaccination is available, mass produced, and distributed widely.”Restrictions The current restrictions on movement in Ireland, which are due to end on Easter Sunday, will be considered at a NPHET meeting on Friday. Dr Holohan said he wasn’t anticipating any change to these restrictions “at this moment in time”.The team will also consider the public health implications of setting up a childcare scheme to facilitate healthcare workers.The Cabinet is due to meet on Tuesday for an update on the Covid-19 emergency. It is expected to consider a memorandum of understanding with Northern Ireland on dealing with the Coronavirus crisis.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4221960.1586170700!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"it s just stuff doctor leaves all possessions behind in australia to return to work in ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Marianne Hennigan at Dublin Airport on Saturday. Photograph: Ireland’s CallThe world has changed completely since Dr Marianne Hennigan started a four-week holiday in New Zealand in mid-March. Then, governments were waking up to the reality of Covid-19, but it was still a disease mostly confined to China and Europe and not to Australia and New Zealand.Nobody expected the raft of restrictions which would shut down the world in the space of a few weeks. Within a week of her arrival in New Zealand, the bus tour was cancelled and she, along with others on the tour, was forced to self-isolate in Auckland. Dr Hennigan (31), originally from Deansgrange, Co Dublin, was working in Perth at the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital as a locum doctor in emergency medicine. Like hundreds of other Irish newly-qualified doctors she found the opportunities and the climate in Perth agreeable and had spent three years there. Her flight back to Perth from Auckland was abruptly cancelled with no replacement available. In this hiatus, she made up her mind not to go back to Perth at all, but leave her car and her possessions there and return to Ireland to work. “In the end of the day it’s just stuff. I really enjoyed working in Perth,” she said. “It was lovely, the biggest thing that I regret is that I didn’t get to say goodbye to any of my friends when I left. I’m sure I will at some point. Unfortunately, none of us really expected what was going to happen.” Her marathon flight home, first to Doha in Qatar, and then to Ireland was facilitated by the Ireland’s Call Initiative which is not to be confused with On Call for Ireland, the HSE call for healthcare professionals, students and volunteers to help tackle coronavirus in Ireland. The Ireland’s Call Initiative was set up by businessman Neil Sands as a philanthropic enterprise to bring doctors and nurses home from abroad and to pay for their flights and accommodation in self-isolation for a fortnight. Ireland’s Call hopes to bring home 100 Irish medics from abroad in the coming months. She is the first to be repatriated under the initiative and one of more than 50,000 people who have offered their services to the HSE since last month. “We are not the real heroes,” she stressed. “The real heroes are the people who have been there from day one. We are the reinforcements. “I am delighted to be home. I was particularly happy to see my mum at the airport. It is just a relief to be coming home for the foreseeable future and that I won’t be stuck. “The main fear is that working in ICU, where it is high-risk, if I were to get sick, my family wouldn’t be able to come out to see me in Perth. At this time you want to be in proximity with your family and around Irish people.” She will need the next fortnight to register for and find work. Her experience in emergency respiratory medicine in Perth will be invaluable for her and for the HSE as it seeks to cope with the pandemic. There will be other business to attend to and making a will is something she feels is necessary given the risks involved. “I think everybody is fearful at this point in time when you see young healthcare workers getting sick and dying,” she said. “It is obvious that I didn’t intend to do it at this stage of my life. It is our profession and it is something that I want to help out. I would much rather be in the front line helping out than being stuck in another country in an Airbnb.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4223491.1586291011!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"first look spectacular supermoon due in irish skies this week","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA pink supermoon rises over the Rock of Dunamase in Co Laois on Tuesday evening. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA Wire A supermoon will be visible in Irish skies from early on Wednesday morning as it makes its closest approach to the Earth.A full moon is due at 3.35am and will be visible both in morning and evening skies for the coming days. This week’s moon is know as a supermoon because the full m oon coincides with the perigee or its closest approach to Earth. The moon’s orbit of the Earth is slightly elliptical rather than circular, meaning it is closer at certain times.The moon has been large and almost full already this week and if people can’t wait until tomorrow it will appear spectacularly large and bright in skies on Tuesday night from about 8.30pm. However, technically speaking, it won’t be full or a supermoon until early on Wednesday morning.It will continue large and bright in our skies on Wednesday and Thursday night before gradually appearing smaller and less full.On Wednesday morning the moon will be 356,000 kilometres away from the Earth. At apogee, or furthest point away, it is 405,000 kilometres away.Hence the supermoon will be between 12 and 14 per cent bigger than normal.The forecast over the coming days is for mostly dry weather so there is a good chance of seeing the supermoon in all its glory.This particular moon is called the pink supermoon as it corresponds with the spring flowering of the moss pink in North America.The moon before Easter is known in the Christian calendar as the Paschal full moon.The moveable feast of Easter is held on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the spring equinox which occurs on March 21st.On Good Friday morning, April 10th, there will be a conjunction in the morning skies of the planets Jupiter, Saturn and Mars, all of which will be clearly visible to the naked eye.The three bright planets will appear in a line from the horizon."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4222318.1586192995!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eccentric thai king s flying visits ensure a colourful german lockdown","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThailand’s King Maha Vajiralongkorn arrives to pay respects at the King Rama I monument to mark Chakri Memorial Day that honours the founding of the ruling Chakri Dynasty in Bangkok on April 6th, 2020.

Using a full-sized Boeing 737-800 just for himself, the king is reportedly a fan of “touch-and-go” flights in which the plane takes off again after only a brief touch-down. German aviation experts believe the king is flying the plane himself to keep up the minimum number of flight hours required for a pilot’s licence.For years as crown prince, Thais have looked on in amazement and amusement at his antics, in particular his push to suppress an image of himself in a crop top with fake tattoos, enjoying an ice cream in a German shopping centre.Six-hour ceremony He was crowned king last May, nearly three years after his father’s death, in a six-hour ceremony that cost a reported €29 million. Since becoming king, the married monarch took on a royal consort but stripped her of the title again months later for “disrespectful” behaviour to the queen.His current wife, a former bodyguard, is his fourth. He married his first wife, a cousin, in 1977 and they had a daughter together. At the same time he had four sons and a daughter with a mistress but when he filed for orce, in 1993, he accused his wife of adultery. When the subsequent marriage to his mistress collapsed after two years, she fled to the UK and he accused her, too, of adultery.He kept secret his third marriage, to a waitress, until she gave birth to their son in 2005. At the time the prince said he was anxious to settle down and made his poodle, Foo-Foo, a chief marshall in the Thai air force.A former US ambassador, in a leaked cable from 2007, recalled how, during a musical interlude at a state banquet, the chief marshall, wearing full evening wear, “jumped up on to the head table and began lapping from the guests’ water glasses, including my own”.\u0026nbspFoo-Foo died in 2015 and was given a full-on four-day Buddhist funeral.Though a constitutional monarch, the king’s estimated fortune of up to €100 billion, combined with stringent lèse-majesté rules, have kept him largely insulated from criticism or financial concerns.But with Thailand registering 2,220 confirmed cases of coronavirus on Monday, and 26 deaths, reports of the king’s colourful life in Bavaria have seen a Twitter hashtag trending among his subjects: #whydoweneedaking. \u0026nbspEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Donald Trump threatens to cut funding to World Health Organisation as US coronavirus deaths hit daily recordCan I see separated parents or move house during lockdown?

Iceland is doing both.Mr Gudnason\u0027s team of 60 police investigators and healthcare workers act as detectives on each confirmed case, tracking down those they have come in contact with.  Testing is carried out by The National Health Service on those showing symptoms. But on top of this, a biopharma company, deCODE Genetics, has been screening random samples of the population to build the world\u0027s most extensive study yet of how the virus behaves in a population.Early results show 50 per cent of carriers of the virus are asymptomatic. It has also revealed up to 40 \u0027mutations\u0027, or strains, of the disease. They claim to have traced strains back to Italy, Austria, the US, and seven cases in particular to one undisclosed football match in the UK.Crucially, all the testing has meant Iceland has been able to avoid a lockdown or quarantine as cases are tracked, traced and isolated before spreading rapidly - thus alleviating pressure on the hospitals.The data rolling in has meant authorities can more accurately design methods of controlling the virus, Mr Stefánsson says.So far there is a government ban on gatherings of more than 20 people and light guidelines on social distancing.The guidance is imposed not by force but by trust, Katrín Jakobsdottir, Iceland\u0027s prime minister, tells The  .Iceland has a history of socially liberal culture, she says. That means acceptance of differences and minorities, but in this case, it means to trust, not to force. We have no tradition of militarism or an army. We ask for cooperation, rather than force it.  She adds that the science approach allows her to leave the virus policy out of the battlefield of politics.The limited guidelines means business is slow for most shops, but with few exceptions the country is open for business.Icelanders can still get their morning coffee, sit down at local bookshops. Even stop at a local ice-cream parlour.At Reykjavík Roasters, a small but popular independent cafe in Reykjavík\u0027s centre, customers trickle in despite the pandemic. The city\u0027s centre is unusually calm.“Honestly, what I miss more than anything are the public pools” pensioner Auður Styrkásdóttir says apologetically, adding “this is a luxury.”One of the main benefits of Iceland\u0027s system is the school programme has been largely unaffected.Pre-schools, primary, and secondary schools have stayed open while higher education has moved online.Some people have taken to social media asking why children\u0027s safety is perhaps taken less seriously than those of adult students.Mr Gudnason points out that closing down institutions that serve children has a more significant social impact Our study suggests that children are less effective in spreading this virus than adults. We measure every decision with it\u0027s effectiveness and closing these institutions is unlikely to produce meaningful results at this time.Part of Iceland\u0027s success story is it\u0027s readiness.We realised at the end of 2019 that we should prepare for a pandemic, Mr Gudnason says.Our emergency system is clear, it is efficient and importantly frequently in use. Be it storms, avalanches, volcanic eruptions or a pandemic the system is the same. Health authorities step into a well-oiled machine, highly trained infrastructure and years of experience in building communication channels and trust.On Friday the head of Iceland\u0027s response, Víðir Reynisson, warned against drawing too much from the Iceland model, pointing out that the country\u0027s size, strong channels of communication and social cohesion helped.There are many factors that make things easier on us, he said.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus vaccine could ready autumn scientists suggest","story":"A coronavirus vaccine could be ready as early as the autumn,  an Oxford University research team has said.The “best case scenario” suggests scientists are aiming for a much more ambitious rollout than previously thought.However, the Oxford team, one of many working around the clock to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, warned that it was still trying to source funding for manufacturing the potential drug.The Oxford trial, a collaboration between the University’s Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group clinical teams, has recruited more than 500 volunteers aged between 18 and 55 who will begin the tests this month following an “overwhelming” response.Asked about the timescale for a potential roll-out, if successful, the researchers said: “The best-case scenario is that by the autumn of 2020 we have the results about the effectiveness of the vaccine from a phase III trial and the ability to manufacture large amounts of the vaccine.”They acknowledged, however, that such “best-case timeframes” were “highly ambitious” and subject to change. They added: “We are currently trying to source additional funding for the scale-up of vaccine manufacturing to produce enough doses for deployment.”Participants will remain in the trial for six months, attending appointments at the Oxford Vaccine Centre for screening, vaccination with either the new COVID-19 vaccine or a control injection, and blood tests. The team warned that if the peak of disease transmission arrives before the vaccine is ready for trials, the studies will be “challenging”. “If virus transmission has stopped, then it is impossible to assess whether the vaccine can prevent disease,” they said.“At the moment it is not possible to identify who has already been infected, and if the virus is spreading quickly throughout the population it might be difficult to find unexposed people to take part in the trial. Conducting trials after the peak subsides presents another problem, because so many people will have developed a natural immunity by then, and the amount of transmission will have dropped so that those who are still not immune will take longer to be exposed to the virus.”Conducting trials after the peak subsides presents another problem, because so many people will have developed a natural immunity by then, and the amount of transmission will have dropped so that those who are still not immune will take longer to be exposed to the virus. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"allow young people lockdown early get country moving claim business","story":"Allowing young people aged between 20 and 30 out of lockdown early could help get Britain moving again and avoid an extraordinary recession, business experts have said.As the Government\u0027s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, told the daily press conference that the epidemic curve appeared to be flattening off, speculation is growing as to how the UK can escape from its lockdown.Researchers at the University of Warwick calculated that allowing 4.2 million young adults to resume their daily lives would boost the economy by £13 billion, while shielding more vulnerable age groups.Older adults could then be allowed out of lockdown later, through a strategy of staged release using antibody testing to identify those who had already recovered from coronavirus.Andrew Oswald, Professor of Economics and Behavioural Science at Warwick, said: The rationale for lockdown is to save lives in the short to medium term.However, severe damage is being done to the economy, future incomes, unemployment rates, levels of national debt and the freedoms we enjoy as a modern society. Before long, some balance will have to be struck.Earlier this week, it emerged that mass antibody testing – to find out if people are immune – is at least a month away following disappointing trials, carried out by Oxford University, in a setback some experts said would hold up a lockdown exit strategy.Yet scientists say that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests which look for current infections could still be used alongside contact tracing and self-isolation to lift the lockdown when case numbers stabilise.The Government has committed to carrying out 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month, although it is currently only managing 14,000.Jonathan Ball, Professor of Molecular Virology at the University of Nottingham, said: If you can start to get case numbers down to a manageable level, then you can use PCR testing to identify active cases, or at least a sufficiently large proportion of them, to allow isolation and then contact tracing from those points of infection.This will require a much larger testing capacity than we have now.Martin Hibberd, Professor of Emerging Infectious Disease at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said Britain could look to other countries to see how they have successfully managed exit strategies or avoided mass lockdowns. The successful strategies we have seen elsewhere involve very large-scale testing of the population and as much contact tracing as possible to enable the identification of people who are positive for SARS-CoV-2 and so able to transmit the disease, he said.The people identified would need to self-quarantine for two weeks. While this strategy was difficult to achieve at the beginning of the outbreak, because of logistic problems in getting the testing done at such a large scale and our lack of experience at large scale contact tracing, we should now be able to overcome these problems.The chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, said no exit strategy would be considered until we are confident we are beyond the peak. However, he said the Government was aware there may be indirect effects in erting so many resources to fighting coronavirus, suggesting that there could be a tipping point at which lockdown is no longer beneficial for the country.Countries including the US and Sweden are now starting to question whether early modelling from Imperial College was too pessimistic and are revising down the number of deaths expected as well as the amount of intensive care beds that will be needed. Last weekend, Professor Neil Ferguson, part of the team responsible for the figures, said the number of deaths in Britain could now be as low as 7,000.A review published on Tuesday in The BMJ by Oxford University warned that many scientific studies rushed out in the race to understand the virus were of poor quality and should not be relied upon to inform policy or medical decisions.Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, who is deputising for Boris Johnson while the Prime Minister is in hospital, said there are now 1,900 patients in clinical trials in over 100 hospitals. If a treatment is discovered, it could allow the population out of lockdown sooner.Highlighting the benefits of allowing young people out of lockdown, Nick Powdthavee, Professor of Behavioural Economics at Warwick Business School, said: It could allow our society and economy to move forward in the footsteps of the young, while allowing older workers to share the economic rewards by providing supervision, mentoring, and managerial assistance electronically through sources such as Skype, Zoom, and Facetime.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"four stages coronavirus treatment simple oxygen mask thelast","story":"Covid-19 patients whose illness is severe enough to be admitted to hospital face a battery of tests and possible treatment options.The most important tests measure blood oxygen levels, to understand if the lungs are functioning properly, and blood pressure tests, to understand the stress on the heart and wider vascular system.Treatment options are all designed to support the patient in fighting off the virus, rather than cure them, and move through a series of stages, each becoming more invasive and onerous. Those stages are:This is the most basic form of hospital therapy for coronavirus patients who have become breathless and are struggling to get enough oxygen into their blood. Patients are fitted with a simple mask and piped oxygen-enriched air to help them along.For the next step, patients are fitted with an airtight mask and the oxygen-air mix they receive is pressurised to help them breathe. At this stage, monitoring of a patient\u0027s vital signs will become more intense. The patient remains conscious.Next, a ventilator is required to push air in and out of the lungs. This is an invasive procedure for which the patient is put to sleep, probably on their front to take the weight of the heart off the lungs. The ventilator keeps the patient alive, giving their body time to fight the virus.This is the option of last resort. It is used when ventilation can no longer get oxygen through the patient’s lungs and into the bloodstream because the lungs have become too damaged and inflamed.ECMO machines bypass the lungs and oxygenate the patient\u0027s blood outside their body before returning to them. It is similar in concept to the heart bypass machines used during open-heart surgery and is one of the most aggressive forms of life support available.The machines are seen as the “last-chance saloon” of respiratory aid, and Guy’s \u0026amp St Thomas’ is one of five centres in the UK that offers ECMO for adults. Others include the Royal Brompton and Harefield Hospital (London), Glenfield Hospital in Leicester, Papworth Hospital in Cambridge and Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester.The World Health Organisation has issued interim guidelines recommending the use of ECMO on Covid-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — respiratory failure when lungs are so ravaged that ventilation is no longer sufficient.The machines,  which costs about £100,000 each, consist of an artificial membrane lung, a pump and a blood warmer — all of which are connected by plastic tubing.Blood is removed from the body, and pumped through the artificial lung, called the oxygenator.  As well as oxygenating the blood, the ECMO machine removes carbon dioxide and warms the blood before then returning it to the patient.ECMO is used for Covid-19 patients suffering from respiratory failure.The patient is given an anaesthetic and a cannulae is placed directly into the femoral vein on the side of the neck (and internal jugular vein if required), which is then connected to the ECMO circuit.The removal of blood from the body can cause it to clot, so a blood-thinning drug called heparin is used. This can result in bleeding throughout the body and the need for blood transfusions.During the outbreak in China, ECMO machines were used on the most severely ill  patients, and in a mid-March webinar sponsored by the American College of Cardiology, doctors from Wuhan advised the west to start ECMO “sooner rather than later”.But ECMO is not a cure it is a life-support measure used to provide relief for the lungs and is only suitable for a small number of patients who are otherwise fit and well. The prognosis for anyone put on an ECMO machine is by definition poor.One reason for failure is its impact on the immune system. Along with the known ECMO complications of bleeding, infection risk, seizures and possible severe neurological damage due to loss of blood supply (ischaemia), a substantial decrease in the number and function of vital infection-fighting white blood cells - called lymphocytes - is common.An ECMO specialist said: “The procedure is risky in itself, because you’re putting blood through a machine full of synthetic surfaces, something blood normally reacts to and that can cause cellular damage and inflammatory response syndrome. The machine also chews up platelets so there can be damage to red blood cells.”While many studies showing high survival rates among ECMO patients in different scenarios have been published, little is known about its success with Covid-19.A small retrospective, observational study by doctors in China published by the American Medical Association in February showed that five out of six (83 per cent) patients with severe Covid-19 who received ECMO died, but doctors have warned against comparing data between China and the UK.“That figure will be a reflection on the rates in that particular hospital, but local variables play a factor such as how patients are isolated and managed, medical protocols that are being followed,” said the specialist. “It’s difficult to extrapolate any real meaning.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pensioner rejected van gogh masterpiece family clear out has","story":"A pensioner who turned down a Van Gogh masterpiece when her in-laws said it was worthless has admitted she was “very naive” after it sold for an estimated £13million.Gaye Horrell, 76, was offered the painting - entitled Peasant Woman in Front of a Farmhouse - for free in 1967.The painting was sold at the The European Fine Art Fair in Holland last month to a mystery buyer, and although the price has not been revealed, the painting - showing a peasant woman in a blue dress outside a ramshackle farmhouse and completed by Van Gogh in 1885 - was estimated to sell for between £12m-£13m.Speaking after the sale Mrs Horrell - who was married to Tim Holme at the time in Staffordshire - revealed that her in-laws Charles and Molly Holme asked if she wanted anything from their farmhouse before they held a sale.She was offered the Van Gogh - given to the Holme family in 1929 for payment for farm supplies - but was persuaded by her in-laws that it was \u0027not worth having\u0027 so instead chose a brass handbell, worth little more than £1 at the time.Mrs Horrell, who now lives in the scenic Cotswolds village of Ashton Keynes and works with husband Paul as joint-treasurers of the Holy Cross Church in the village, said: In 1967 I was living in Stafford, married to Tim Holme, elder son of Charles Holme.My in-laws Charles and Molly Holme had the sale of household bits and pieces alongside the farm sale and I was told to choose something for myself beforehand.The painting looked old, very dirty and uncared for, and it had a hole in it, but I still liked it.They persuaded me it was not worth having and not to bother with it.The painting was sold in 1967 for just £4 to a local auction house and was next seen in a junk shop in north London, where it was bought for £45 by Luigi Grasso, who spotted the faint signature \u0027Vincent\u0027 on the painting.He then researched the origins of the painting and it was eventually verified as an original by the Dutch master by Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam and in 1970.It sold for almost £100,000 in 1970, then to an American collector for £1.5m in 2001 before coming up for sale this year,Mrs Horrell added: As I was advised not to bother I have seen various articles about its life after the sale, but there was not a lot I could do.Oh dear, how very naive of me.

There is an issue of people not being as observant as they were last weekend.The worst of all worlds is having all this economic damage but not actually having the benefit of people observing social distancing.Simon Kempton, operational policing lead for the Police Federation, said an “emotional” campaign highlighting the deaths of nurses and doctors from the coronavirus as a way to get the minority of refuseniks to “want to comply rather than feel they have to.”There is a cautious optimism among police chiefs that the lockdown may be having an effect. Police abstraction rate - the number of officers off ill or self-isolating - has dropped slightly from 13.1 per cent to 12.8 per cent.Nonetheless, they still believe the lockdown - due to be reviewed at the end of next week - will be extended for at least another three weeks “on the basis that you have it for longer than you need it rather than have to lift it and have a resurgence,” said the source.However, a senior police source said: “Easter weekend will knock it one way or another. There is a real disappointment at what happened on the weekend.“I believe that if Easter weekend is bad and people flout the restrictions again, they will increase the restrictions - that people will have to stay at home, no excuse, no nothing.”Another option is to blitz areas of high non-compliance with police officers and fines. “We should go out there and say that if you are out without a reasonable excuse that you will be fined. We should just lay down the law at the weekend,” said a Whitehall source.It came as Dame Cressida Dick, the politan Police Commissioner, said that people who refuse to leave public spaces when asked to do so will be forced to by the police.We will always try to advise people to explain, to encourage people to comply and if necessary to move on, not to stop and sunbathe - that\u0027s not exercising or travelling to work or shopping,” she said.If we have to we will be very firm in that, if somebody completely refuses - but this is an absolute last resort - it will result in enforcement.” She declined to comment on whether tighter restrictions were needed, but said: The Met will stand by and be ready to assist whichever direction they go in whenever that is.Devon Councillor Frank Biederman has called on his local authority to endorse checkpoints on the regions\u0027 main roads to catch people trying to sneak in from the cities amid reports that many holiday home owners have already relocated to the county.In Cornwall there have been more than 200 reports of properties being rented out to holidaymakers despite Government guidance which states all such activity should have ceased.The council said that a number of AirBnB properties, two glamping sites, guest houses, a campsite, and a holiday cottage letting agency were among those still breaking the rules.There have also been calls for AirBnB to scrap reservations whilst the lockdown measures are in place.Brendan O\u0027Hara, the MP for Argyll and Bute, has written to the online booking site warning: “Hundreds of people in my constituency and other rural regions have raised serious concerns that tourists are \u0027escaping\u0027 the virus by coming to these areas and that Airbnb is continuing to allow holidaymakers to reserve holiday accommodation.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"urban wildlife now diverse many national parks says leading","story":"Urban wildlife is more erse than that in many national parks, a leading naturalist who works with Sir David Attenborough has said.Benedict Macdonald, an author and nature specialist who produces wildlife programmes, said a typical urbanised area in London contains more wildlife than a similar area in the Peak District, Snowdonia or Exmoor.He said these wild places are heavily \u0027\u0027exploited and degraded\u0027\u0027, so life fails to flourish.Areas of habitat in urban London, by contrast, can burst with life because they are largely left alone, he said.Mr Macdonald, who has worked on Springwatch and the Netflix Our Planet series, narrated by Sir David Attenborough, said it is a national disgrace that Britain\u0027s national parks are silent.He believes that the spots are now used largely for non-native timber production, sheep and cattle rearing, and the rearing of grouse and deer hordes for hunting in unnatural densities.Parks, docklands and even industrial estates were found to have thriving or sustainable populations of threatened species on the RSPB\u0027s Red List.These included the lapwing, lesser spotted woodpecker, tree sparrow and marsh warbler as well as adaptable predators such as peregrine falcons and otters - living right within the city.The naturalist said: Walking through a national park, you should expect a deafening ersity of natural life to greet you.Instead, there is little more than silence.If you head to a national park expecting to see animals thriving in their natural habitat, or indeed in any numbers, then you will mostly be sorely disappointed.Speaking generally, our national parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) are little more than green deserts that are being exploited as natural factories at the cost of native wildlife.This in my view is a national disgrace.Mr Macdonald has, for a new book, examined the ersity within an approximate 11-square mile area of the Dark Peak in the Peak District, Dunkery Beacon on Exmoor, Snowdon and its foothills in Snowdonia, and Loch Lomond in the Scottish Trossachs.He then compared his findings with a similar-sized region across the London boroughs of Camden, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth, Southwark, Westminster and the City of London.The results were astonishing and saddening in equal measure, he said.He found that the capital is also a haven for insects such as solitary bees and impressive stag beetles, and that central London is also home to many different types of wildflowers, including orchids, and a range of rare or threatened species from bitterns to water voles and hedgehogs.Most national parks should play host to these species and to many more non-urbanised creatures like golden eagles, capercaillie and wildcats.But the results of his research suggested that, in the regions he examined, many are in fact virtually lifeless.In both Snowdonia and The Trossachs, \u0027tree farming\u0027 has led to the \u0027total disregard\u0027 of native oak woodland in favour of plantations of faster-growing Sitka spruce, he said.Because the spruce is non-native to Britain, it is can only be inhabited by a few species of wildlife, compared to our natural woodlands.All of the parks, to varying degrees, are also used for sheep and deer grazing, and he argued that large numbers of these animals \u0027mow\u0027 the undergrowth as they eat - stripping away the wild flowers and tree saplings that would otherwise grow to provide a natural shelter for wildlife.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/12/16/08/stars.jpg","title":"atlas comet earth sky night space 2019 y4","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Object was likely to become one of the brightest sights in the skyA comet that is hurtling towards Earth, prompting hopes for a blazing flyby, appears to have disintegrated, according to astronomers tracking it.Comet Atlas had been forecast to become really, really stunning within weeks, as it got closer to Earth.Astronomers expected that it could be seen moving among the stars before reaching its closest point to us, in May.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThey spoke hopefully of spotting its greenish hue as it blazed through the solar system, though noted that much was still mysterious about the object, which was first spotted in May.Now, however, the object appears to have broken up and will not make for such a beautiful – or even visible –\u0026nbspsight once it actually arrives.Comet heading closer to Earth and could soon be visibleAstronomers tracking the journey of the comet, which is officially known as\u0026nbspC2019 Y4 (ATLAS), show that it appears to have broken up.Recent images show that there appears to be an elongated pseudo-nucleus that is lined up with the tail.

This is intended to make the cost of an overdraft easier to understand and to compare with other forms of borrowing.In response, many banks raised their overdraft rates to about 40 per cent in order to recoup some of the money they will lose from daily charges. Some banks have now reversed those changes, temporarily reverting to the older fees while introducing interest-free limits.HSBC UK will bring in a three-month £500 interest-free buffer from 9 April for bank account and advance account customers. It will also cut the rate charged above its interest-free buffer from 39.9 per cent to 19.9 per cent.Santander will waive the interest on the first £500 of any arranged overdraft used between 6 April and 9 July and has introduced a temporary discount interest rate of 19.9 per cent.Millions of people have seen a hit to their incomes since the Covid-19 crisis began.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.People were asked about changes to their personal finances, the general economy and whether they feel now is the right time to make major purchases, during interviews between 16 and 27 March.The results produced an overall negative score in the “consumer confidence barometer” from GfK of minus 34, indicating a sharp decline in confidence of 25 points from a score of minus nine in mid-March.Debenhams had been in trouble before the current crisis, which has seen all but essential shops close their doors. A year ago, the chain went through a restructuring process known as a pre-pack administration, which saw lenders take control\u0026nbspand shareholders, including Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct, wiped out.The 242-year-old company is already in the process of closing around 50 stores as it seeks to slash costs and focus on profitable sites. Of those, 22 have shut so far.Debenhams said the new administration would be “light touch”, suggesting it would not involve further, large-scale store closures but some analysts remain sceptical.“This is the first example of a so-called ‘light touch’ administration which has been promoted by practitioners to protect the company from hostile actions during the current crisis,” said David Ereira, a restructuring partner and insolvency expert at international law firm Paul Hastings. “Debenhams has, however, been in financial difficulty for some time now, so how long any new measures can keep it afloat remain to be seen.”Sean Moran, an insolvency partner at law firm Shakespeare Martineau\u0026nbspwarned that other well-known names may be forced to call in the administrators.“The government has stated its intention to facilitate cash injections and other financial assistance to businesses, recognising the imminent threat of insolvencies in many sectors,” he said. “These measures include the temporary business rates relief set out in the Budget which will benefit many smaller retailers in the short term.“It remains to be seen how quickly the processes for accessing other funds and the payment mechanisms promised will actually materialise. Cash remains king at present and those businesses without cash or access to credit lines will have massive problems.”Stefaan Vansteenkiste, the chief executive of Debenhams, said on Monday: “These are unprecedented circumstances and we have taken this step to protect our business, our employees\u0026nbspand other important stakeholders so that we are in a position to resume trading from our stores when government restrictions are lifted.“We are working with a group of highly supportive owners and lenders and anticipate that additional funding will be made available to bridge us through the current crisis period.“With their support and working with other key stakeholders, including landlords, pension trustees and business partners, we are striving to protect jobs and reopen as many Debenhams stores for trading as we can, as soon as this is possible.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The film, which was released in December, ended up losing Universal Pictures close to $100m after struggling at the box office.Speaking anonymously to The Daily Beast, a source who worked on the film’s special effects has now claimed that the high-profile effects errors in the film were the result of a rushed production.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesComparing the experience to “slavery”, the source said that the CGI for the film’s controversial first trailer took six months to produce, leaving just four months to finish the special effects on the actual film itself.“It was pure, almost slavery for us, how much work we put into it with no time, and everything was difficult,” the source said. “We were so rushed on the project that we’d have no time for anything.Cocaine and Michael Caine: Whatever happened to the Britpop B-listers?How Twin Peaks changed television and melted our brains in the processThe cats from Cats, ranked from least to most embarrassing“So when people say, ‘Oh, the effects were not good,’ or ‘The animation’s not good,’ or anything, that’s not our fault. We have no time.“Six months to do a two-minute trailer and four months to do a film of an hour and a half. My math is pretty good... You could figure that doesn’t make any sense.”The source also alleged that Hooper would make unusual requests to the special effects team, including asking to see footage of real cats performing the same dance movements he envisioned for the actors ultimately dressed as cats.They also alleged that Hooper would be “disrespectful”, “demeaning” and “condescending” to the team, adding: “When you go into a conference room, you’re not allowed to speak. And he talks to you like you’re garbage.”The Daily Beast said that neither Hooper nor Universal Pictures would comment on the allegations.The Independent has reached out to a representative for Hooper for comment.Cats featured an all-star cast including Taylor Swift, Idris Elba, Judi Dench and James Corden. On a production budget of $95m, it grossed just $75m worldwide following savage reviews and online mockery.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the maps, for instance, inidual identities are obscured in the hope that nobody in the data could be identified, and the data shows information at a city level but not the behaviour of specific people.Google made similar commitments when it made its data from Maps publicly available to researchers. It published that information for the public to read, too, arguing that doing so ensured the company was being transparent about what data it was making public.For users who are selected to take part in the survey, it will appear at the top of the news feed.

Borrowers would not have to make repayments on their loans but would still accrue interest.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSantander and HSBC have already announced they will temporarily waive overdraft fees on balances up to £500.

This is intended to make the cost of an overdraft easier to understand and to compare with other forms of borrowing.In response, many banks raised their overdraft rates to about 40 per cent in order to recoup some of the money they will lose from daily charges. Some banks have now reversed those changes, temporarily reverting to the older fees while introducing interest-free limits.HSBC UK will bring in a three-month £500 interest-free buffer from 9 April for bank account and advance account customers. It will also cut the rate charged above its interest-free buffer from 39.9 per cent to 19.9 per cent.Santander will waive the interest on the first £500 of any arranged overdraft used between 6 April and 9 July and has introduced a temporary discount interest rate of 19.9 per cent.Millions of people have seen a hit to their incomes since the Covid-19 crisis began.

A separate report from Auto Analysis and Global Data forecast that manufacturers will lose out on $100bn (£82bn) in car sales as their factories lie dormant across Europe and North America.Meanwhile, the UK construction sector suffered its largest job cuts since 2010 after measures to stop the spread of coronavirus halted work and caused a slump in new orders.The closely watched IHS MarkitChartered Institute of Procurement and\u0026nbspSupply (CIPS)\u0026nbspconstruction purchasing managers’ index\u0026nbspdropped to 39.3 for March, from 52.6 in February.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.People were asked about changes to their personal finances, the general economy and whether they feel now is the right time to make major purchases, during interviews between 16 and 27 March.The results produced an overall negative score in the “consumer confidence barometer” from GfK of minus 34, indicating a sharp decline in confidence of 25 points from a score of minus nine in mid-March.Debenhams had been in trouble before the current crisis, which has seen all but essential shops close their doors. A year ago, the chain went through a restructuring process known as a pre-pack administration, which saw lenders take control\u0026nbspand shareholders, including Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct, wiped out.The 242-year-old company is already in the process of closing around 50 stores as it seeks to slash costs and focus on profitable sites. Of those, 22 have shut so far.Debenhams said the new administration would be “light touch”, suggesting it would not involve further, large-scale store closures but some analysts remain sceptical.“This is the first example of a so-called ‘light touch’ administration which has been promoted by practitioners to protect the company from hostile actions during the current crisis,” said David Ereira, a restructuring partner and insolvency expert at international law firm Paul Hastings. “Debenhams has, however, been in financial difficulty for some time now, so how long any new measures can keep it afloat remain to be seen.”Sean Moran, an insolvency partner at law firm Shakespeare Martineau\u0026nbspwarned that other well-known names may be forced to call in the administrators.“The government has stated its intention to facilitate cash injections and other financial assistance to businesses, recognising the imminent threat of insolvencies in many sectors,” he said. “These measures include the temporary business rates relief set out in the Budget which will benefit many smaller retailers in the short term.“It remains to be seen how quickly the processes for accessing other funds and the payment mechanisms promised will actually materialise. Cash remains king at present and those businesses without cash or access to credit lines will have massive problems.”Stefaan Vansteenkiste, the chief executive of Debenhams, said on Monday: “These are unprecedented circumstances and we have taken this step to protect our business, our employees\u0026nbspand other important stakeholders so that we are in a position to resume trading from our stores when government restrictions are lifted.“We are working with a group of highly supportive owners and lenders and anticipate that additional funding will be made available to bridge us through the current crisis period.“With their support and working with other key stakeholders, including landlords, pension trustees and business partners, we are striving to protect jobs and reopen as many Debenhams stores for trading as we can, as soon as this is possible.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

However, she said such restrictions should only be imposed in the right conditions.“The message we are getting is if we don’t take care of nature, it will take care of us,” Ms\u0026nbspMrema\u0026nbsptold\u0026nbsp.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus Podcast“It would be good to ban the live animal markets as China has done and some countries. But we should also remember you have communities, particularly from low-income rural areas, particularly in Africa, which are dependent on wild animals to sustain the livelihoods of millions of people,” she said.“Unless we get alternatives for these communities, there might be a danger of opening up illegal trade in wild animals which currently is already leading us to the brink of extinction for some species.”China temporarily banned people\u0026nbspfrom eating and trading wildlife\u0026nbspfor food earlier this year\u0026nbspas the country\u0026nbspworked to combat the spread of coronavirus.​Humane Society International, an animal charity, has\u0026nbspcalled for this ban to become a permanent fixture across the globe.“The capture and consumption of wild animals is a global trade that causes immense suffering for hundreds of thousands of animals every year, including endangered wildlife species being traded to the brink of extinction,” said president Jeffrey Flocken.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In such a scenario, a huge inflammation storm could inadvertently overwhelm vital organs such as the lungs.None of the theories compete with one another, and aspects of all of them, as well as innumerable other factors, could be at play in an inidual case.\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailDr Edward Parker of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, explained how a high viral load can impact humans. He said: “After we are infected with a virus, it replicates in our body’s cells. The total amount of virus a person has inside them is referred to as their ‘viral load’. For Covid-19, early reports from China suggest the viral load is higher in patients with more severe disease, which is also the case for Sars and influenza.\u0026nbsp“The amount of virus we are exposed to at the start of an infection is referred to as the ‘infectious dose’. For influenza, we know that that initial exposure to more virus — or a higher infectious dose — appears to increase the chance of infection and illness. Studies in mice have also shown that repeated exposure to low doses may be just as infectious as a single high dose.”He added: “So all in all, it is crucial for us to limit all possible exposures to Covid-19, whether these are to highly symptomatic iniduals coughing up large quantities of virus or to asymptomatic iniduals shedding small quantities. And if we are feeling unwell, we need to observe strict self-isolation measures to limit our chance of infecting others.”Professor Wendy Barclay, the head of the Department of Infectious Disease at Imperial College London, said existing knowledge of viral load means healthcare workers can be at greater risk of infection.“In general with respiratory viruses, the outcome of infection — whether you get severely ill or only get a mild cold — can sometimes be determined by how much virus actually got into your body and started the infection off.\u0026nbsp It’s all about the size of the armies on each side of the battle, a very large virus army is difficult for our immune systems army to fight off.“So standing further away from someone when they breathe or cough out virus likely means fewer virus particles reach you and then you get infected with a lower dose and get less ill.\u0026nbsp Doctors who have to get very close to patients to take samples from them or to intubate them are at higher risk so need to wear masks.”Genetic differences between those infectedScientists are currently preparing to scour Covid-19 patients’ genomes for DNA variations that might indicate why some people are more at risk than others.\u0026nbspThe findings could then be used to identify groups most at risk of serious illness and those who might be protected, and this knowledge could then inform the hunt for effective treatments.\u0026nbspA huge effort to pool DNA research from patients around the world is now on, with the ultimate goal being to build a body of evidence from people with no underlying health issues, but who have reacted differently to infection by the virus.One promising strand of research into why some people are more susceptible to the coronavirus is on the gene variation for the cell surface protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), found on the outer membranes of cells, and which the coronavirus uses to enter cells in the lungs and airways.Variations in production of ACE2 could make it easier or more difficult for the virus to enter and infect cells.“We see huge differences in clinical outcomes and across countries. How much of that is explained by genetic susceptibility is a very open question,” geneticist Andrea Ganna, of the University of Helsinki’s Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, told Science Magazine.\u0026nbspAnother fascinating line of inquiry is whether different blood types could lead to differing levels of susceptibility to the disease.A Chinese research team reported in a non-peer-reviewed article that people with type O blood may be protected from the virus, and those with type A blood could be at greater risk.\u0026nbsp“We’re trying to figure out if those findings are robust,” Stanford University human geneticist Manuel Rivas told Science Magazine.The first results from the investigations into genetic differences and susceptibility are expected in less than two months’ time.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It occurs when the full moon is at its closest point to Earth in its monthly orbit.On 7-8 April, the moon will get as close as 356,907km (221,772\u0026nbspmiles) to Earth, making it appear bigger and brighter in the night\u0027s sky.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe time of year means this full moon is known in folklore as the \u0027Pink moon\u0027, as it usually coincides with spring flower blossoms.The best time and date to see the supermoon\u0026nbspis at moonrise on Tuesday and at moonset on Wednesday, when it is close to the horizon.How to take the perfect picture of the supermoon this weekThis is due to an optical illusion that makes it appear even bigger due to its relative size to buildings and objects on the horizon.\u0026nbspThe supermoon\u0027s peak illumination will take place just after\u0026nbsp6pm\u0026nbspGMT on Tuesday, though it may not be visible until after sunset.The term was first coined by astrologer Richard Nolle\u0026nbspin 1979, who defined a supermoon\u0026nbspas any full moon that was within 90 per cent of its closest approach.The coinage and use of the term has been criticised by astronomers, however some welcome it as a way to encourage interest\u0026nbspin astronomy.“Some astronomers complain about the name supermoon. They like to call supermoons hype,” astronomer and EarthSky contributor Bruce McClure wrote recently.Created with Sketch.9 best images of the 2016 supermoon Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016“But supermoons aren’t hype. They’re special. Many people now know and use the word supermoon. We notice even some diehards are starting to use it now... No doubt about it. Supermoon is a catchier term than perigean\u0026nbspfull moon.The supermoon will also have an effect on the Earth’s ocean, Mr McClure notes, with the extra gravitational pull from the moon creating extra-high\u0026nbsptides.People living along the coast will notice them one or two days after the supermoon has passed, though any risk of flooding is unlikely unless the high tides are combined with severe weather.For most parts of the UK, Tuesday and Wednesday will see exceptionally good weather with highs of up to 24C\u0026nbspin the south and east.Clear skies and reduced air pollution due to the coronavirus lockdown means April’s supermoon could be one of the best ever times to view a supermoon.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Here’s how to take the perfect picture of it:Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUse a landmark to get perspectiveEveryone will be taking pictures of the supermoon by itself, but some of the best pictures show the moon next to a land mark or trees and houses, which is what helps to give the picture “a sense of place”, says Nasa’s senior photographer, Bill Ingalls. “Think of how to be creative – that means tying it into some land-based object. It can be a local landmark or anything to give your photo a sense of place.”Created with Sketch.9 best images of the 2016 supermoon Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016Pick the best spotLocation isn’t everything, but it can definitely help with getting a perfect picture of the supermoon if you have time to plan it. You can look up the best monuments or statues in your area to photograph the image of the moon against, like Mr Ingalls does in Washington D.C., where he lives. “It means doing a lot of homework. I use Google Maps and other apps – even a compass – to plan where to get just the right angle at the right time,” he told Nasa.Use an app to find the moonUnless you\u0027re an astronomer, the best way to know where the moon will rise or set is to use a app on your smartphone to locate it. There are several free or cheap options you can choose from, each using your phone\u0027s inbuilt accelerometer to know which way you\u0027re facing.The apps can also tell you what phase the moon is in, while some even give other celestial details, like the location of planets and star constellations. Decent options for iOS and Android devices include Star Chart, Sky Safari and Skyview.Get the right exposureIf you’re taking a picture on your camera, control the light balance by first tapping the screen where the moon appears to get the camera to focus on the object before dragging your finger up and down to play with the exposure. “You’ll usually want to drag it down for underexposure to be sure you have all the highlight detail,” National Geographic photographer Michael Christopher Brown said.Use a tripod for your camera or rest your phone on a solid surfaceDavid Reneke, an astronomer and writer for Australian science magazine told ABC.net that if you’re using an SLR or DSLR then it’s important to play with aperture settings on your camera to photograph the supermoon, but that using a tripod is essential.It’s worth using a tripod for taking pictures with a smartphone too, as any camera shake can compromise the quality of the pictures – but if you don’t have one to hand you can simply rest your phone on a window ledge.For older smartphones that use a digital zoom rather than an optical zoom, it’s generally best not to use the zoom as it could compromise the quality of the image. Instead, take the picture and then crop it.Newer phones like the Huawei P30 and P40 series feature incredible zoom capabilities that can take detailed pictures of far away objects. Other cameras come with special features to improve pictures of the night sky, such as the Google Pixel 4’s Astro mode.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She added her reasons for visiting her second home were “not legitimate reasons to be out of my home” and understood she did not follow her own advice.“While I and my family followed the guidance on social distancing at all times, I understand that I did not follow the advice I am giving to others, and I am truly sorry for that.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I know how important this advice is and I do not want my mistake to distract from that,” added Dr Calderwood.“I have a job to do as chief medical officer to provide advice to ministers on the path of this virus and to support the medical profession as they work night and day to save lives, and having spoken with the first minister this morning I will continue to focus entirely on that job.”When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastThe apology\u0026nbspcomes after The Scottish Sun published photos of Dr Calderwood and her family near a coastal retreat in Earlsferry, more than an hour away from Edinburgh,\u0026nbsplate on Saturday.Days before, the 51-year-old posted a photo of her family at their main residence in Edinburgh on Twitter, as they joined the rest of the nation in clapping for front line NHS workers.In the daily coronavirus press briefing on Sunday, Ms Sturgeon\u0026nbspsaid: “The chief medical officer made a mistake in travelling away from her home. Whatever her reasons for doing so, it was wrong and she knows that.“All of us, including me, will make mistakes in these unprecedented times we are living in.

It is vital that everyone adhere\u0026nbspto these requirements.“Police officers and staff are putting themselves in harm’s way day and night to explain these instructions to our communities, encourage co-operation and, where necessary, enforce them.”In a joint statement, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie and Wendy Chamberlain, the MSP and MP respectively for the area where Dr Calderwood has her second home, said: “It is difficult to see how the chief medical officer will be able to carry the important messages about the virus and the lockdown if she has not even followed it herself.”They added: “If we are going to get through this pandemic we need medical leaders who everyone can follow. It is with great regret that we say that the chief medical officer will need to go.”Scotland’s constitution secretary Mike Russell said there was no doubt Dr Calderwood’s visit was “ill-advised”. The\u0026nbspScottish Government confirmed it was an overnight stay to “check on a family home”.Mr Russell said she would be “answerable” for her decision when she appears at the daily coronavirus briefing with Nicola Sturgeon later today.He added: “I’m saying to everybody... do not go out except in the very exceptional circumstances that are listed, think about these things and remember by breaking them you are risking lives.”Scottish Police Federation general secretary Calum Steele said policing the pandemic had been made more difficult and stressed checking on a second home is not one of the “reasonable excuses” providing an exception to emergency coronavirus legislation.He tweeted: “In defending the indefensible has the Scottish Government not just thrown the CMO under the bus? Checking on a 2nd home is not one of the prescribed reasonable excuses.”Monica Lennon,\u0026nbspMSP for central Scotland, said in a statement on Facebook: “As the chief medical officer for Scotland, Catherine Calderwood beams that message into our homes on behalf of the government every single day, however, she has failed to practice what she preaches. Not only is this hypocritical, it is irresponsible and the first minister cannot accept this conduct.“Hundreds of Scots have died and there is no sign of the spread of the virus slowing. The CMO has undermined Scotland’s pandemic response and if she doesn’t offer her resignation the first minister should sack her.”Reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But we’re committed to working with others groups and organisations who come might along to help meet the needs of the community in different ways as time goes on.”He said the group has a pool of over 250 volunteers and an on call rota who are now getting several dozen calls a day from people in the area in “real need” of supplies.“Whatever help\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspcan give in mapping the support network across the country is a good thing, especially if it means more people get access to the support they need,” Mr Vine added.Many food aid charities have been struggling with a drop in donations and a fall in the number of regular volunteers. Yet the mutual aid groups\u0026nbsphave been able to help them adapt by delivering food to people’s doorsteps.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There are a lot of people are struggling to make rent, struggling with loss of income, struggling to access universal credit, as well as isolating for health reasons. It’s such a wide range of things.”Sam Maher, 44, is working with a mutual aid group of volunteers in Machynlleth, covering the small town in west Wales and its surrounding villages.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastThe group began by putting postcards through people’s doors to try to make sure everyone knows help is available for food shopping and picking up of medicines, and at the end of March they also set up a phone line people in urgent need can call.“It’s really just about caring for your community,” she said. “At the moment I think the vast majority of the need out there is being dealt with by neighbour looking after neighbour, which is essential if local authorities and charities are overstretched.“We’re working to create partnerships with other community groups, voluntary bodies and the council to make sure no\u0026nbspone is slipping through the cracks. It’s terrible to think there are people out there that we’re missing. I do worry the safety net isn’t strong enough.”National co-ordinators at Covid-19 Mutual Aid UK estimate there were 1,000 groups\u0026nbspset up in the week after the government announced vulnerable people would have to be shielded from the virus.

Yet members of the public still able to help are signing up to serve a worthy cause.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMarina Nenadic, 30, is one of a several new recruits at\u0026nbspCity Harvest\u0026nbspin Acton, west London, after the food surplus charity called for more hands to sort through the produce rescued from restaurants, manufacturers and supermarket packing houses.“I’m working from home four days a week, so I had some extra time, and I really wanted to do something useful with it,” she explained. “It’s within walking distance of where I live, so I’m not taking any extra risks with journeys.”How to support our campaignMs\u0026nbspNenadic\u0026nbspis a marketing executive for\u0026nbspKew\u0026nbspGardens, but she now spends at least one day a week creating crates of food packages for the 300 smaller groups – including\u0026nbspfood banks, low-income family projects and homeless shelters – served by City Harvest.“It’s a really positive atmosphere, despite the fact it’s such difficult times. It’s actually quite exciting to see so much food come in, knowing it’s going out to people who need it. It’s been such a rewarding thing to do.”In the first two weeks of the coronavirus lockdown, City Harvest has rescued and redistributed over 130 tons of surplus food. Responding to the enormous scale of the crisis, the group has joined forces with even larger food surplus charities in the capital – our campaign partner The Felix Project and Fareshare – to create the\u0026nbspLondon Food Alliance.In a bid to make sure\u0026nbspfood gets out to those who need it\u0026nbspas efficiently as possible, the London Food Alliance is now co-ordinating with all 32 London boroughs to make sure the new, council-run community hubs are well-stocked with supplies.Liz Taylor, 61, signed up for volunteering work at The Felix Project last week, and is now packing and delivering food at\u0026nbspthe charity’s main Park\u0026nbspRoyale\u0026nbspwarehouse.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s actually a bit of relief to get outside and do something. It’s obviously worthwhile, but it’s good for my wellbeing too.”Mohamed Elmi, 34, volunteering with City Harvest for the past 18 months, says\u0026nbspsome of the Acton-based charity’s few dozen or so new volunteers have recently lost jobs in the hospitality industry.“It’s been a difficult time for them but this gives them a sense of purpose,”\u0026nbspsays Mr Elmi, who also works full-time for a homeless healthcare charity. “It’s really helped us fill in for some of the volunteers who are having to stay at home. Yes, we’re putting ourselves at risk – but this work is really needed right now.”London mayor Sadiq Khan told The Independent: “The altruism of the British people in recent days has been a beacon of hope amid the darkness of the coronavirus.”He added: “You can donate spare food at a series of hubs being set up across the city. If you can afford to, you can donate money directly to help keep the food banks open.

We’ll take any decision when the time is right based on the facts and the scientific and medical advice.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Our number one and our overriding focus right now ... is to remain absolutely focused on conveying the key message, which is that everyone needs to keep adhering to this guidance.”Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, said it was “really important that we get to the point that we’re confident that we’re beyond the peak” before deciding how to scale back the lockdown measures.What powers will Dominic Raab have while standing in for Boris JohnsonSpeaking at the same news conference, the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said the number of new cases “could be moving in the right direction”, though\u0026nbspit would not be clear “for a week or so” whether this was the case.He told the regular Downing Street press conference: “It’s possible that we’re beginning to see the beginning of change in terms of the curve flattening a little bit. We won’t know that for sure for a week or so.“There hasn’t been the accelerated take-off and again it’s possible that we’re beginning to see the start of a change where we might see numbers flattening off.“It does begin to suggest that things might be moving in the right direction in terms of numbers and it’s important that we carry on with the measures that we have got in place in order to make sure that this does go in the right direction.”Mr Raab added: “We’ve got a long bank holiday Easter weekend coming up, warm weather, we understand that people are making big sacrifices to follow this guidance. It is helping ... the worst thing now would be to take our foot off the pedal and risk losing the gains that have been made.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Candidates had effectively suspended their campaigns last month as the infections of Covid-19 started to escalate in the UK.Coinciding with Mr Corbyn’s resignation, Boris Johnson also wrote to the leaders of opposition parties at Westminster, inviting them to a briefing of senior government advisers next week as he insisted “we have a duty to work together at this moment of the national unity”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And we have to remember that every number is a family shaken to its foundation,” he said.He added: “Our willingness to come together like this as a nation has been lying dormant for too long. When millions of us stepped out onto our doorsteps to applaud the carers, visibly moved, there was hope of a better future. In times like this, we need good government, a government that saves lives and protects our country.“It’s a huge responsibility and whether we voted for this government or not, we all rely on it to get this right. That’s why in the national interest the Labour Party will play its full part.“Under my leadership we will engage constructively with the government, not opposition for opposition’s sake. Not scoring party political points or making impossible demands. But with the courage to support where that’s the right thing to do.“But we will test the arguments that are put forward. We will shine a torch on critical issues and where we see mistakes or faltering government or things not happening as quickly as they should we’ll challenge that and call that out.”Sir Keir also said he was “sorry” on behalf of the Labour Party for the “stain” that antisemitism had brought on the party in recent years after allegations that have plagued the party under Mr Corbyn’s leadership. “I will tear out this poison by its roots and judge success by the return of Jewish members and those who felt that they could no longer support us,” he added.Former leader Mr Corbyn, who had appeared with Ms Long-Bailey in her campaigning videos, also congratulated Sir Keir on his election victory. “Being Labour Party leader is a great honour and responsibility,” he said. “I look forward to working with Keir and Angela to elect the next Labour government and transform our country”.In a statement, defeated candidate Ms Long-Bailey said Sir Keir will be a “brilliant prime minister and I can’t wait to see him in No 10”, adding: “I will do all I can to make that a reality and to ensure the Labour Party gets into government with a transformative agenda at the next election.”Who will be in Starmer’s shadow cabinet?The left-wing group Momentum – set up to support Mr Corbyn’s radical, left-wing policy agenda in 2015 – said the organisation looks forward to working with him, but also pledged to hold him to account in the coming months and years.“His mandate is to build on Jeremy’s transformative vision, and this means appointing a broad shadow cabinet who believe in the policies and will work with members to make them a reality,” they added. “In this new era Momentum will play a new role.

Please remain inside and we\u0027ll have more supports in the days to come.”Similar advice about the wearing of non-medical face masks\u0026nbsphas been given to the public in a number of countries, with the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention making the same recommendation.Reiterating the importance of hand washing and social distancing, Dr Tam said their use was an “added layer of prevention” to protect those around you from exposure to the coronavirus, should you be infected, but asymptomatic.Health Minister Patty\u0026nbspHajdu\u0026nbspadded her support to the wearing of non-medical cloth masks, saying: “If there was not a way for me to practice social distancing, I wouldn\u0027t hesitate to wear that.”In her own coronavirus case update, Dr Tam confirmed that Canada now has 17,063 cases and 345 deaths.

On Friday Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced new rules requiring all those in workplaces or markets to wear masks. He later banned the sale of the masks amid accusations of price-gouging.Videos posted on social media showed bus drivers handing out free masks to passengers as they boarded. In an extraordinary moment on Tuesday, Turkey’s parliament in Ankara convened to discuss a coronavirus prisoner release law with lawmakers, journalists and council staff all wearing masks.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“We have enough mask stock and production plans for all of our citizens until the outbreak ends,” Mr Erdogan has been quoted as saying late Monday. “As the state, we are determined to provide free masks to all our citizens.”Covid-19 has killed at least 725 people in Turkey, a death toll second only to Iran in the Middle East.

Our farmers will not leave their land uncultivated.”The ban on sales of the masks potentially kills off a lucrative source of income for pharmacies and medical supply companies which have jacked up prices for the products amid unprecedented global demand. Turkey is one of the world’s leading producers of medical personal protective equipment.Mr Erdogan has also announced the construction of two 1,000-bed hospitals to treat pandemic patients in Istanbul, the city hardest hit by the virus.Opposition figures claimed credit for both the free masks programme and the hospitals, but nonetheless praised the government for taking up the ideas. Canan Kaftancıoglu, head of the Istanbul branch of the opposition People’s Republican Party, wrote on Twitter that the country’s 13,000 to 14,000 postal delivery people weren’t enough to distribute the masks.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I hope they won’t be needed, but we’re building them in case they are.They are an insurance policy in case the surge plans at existing hospitals are not enough.But these new facilities and kit are nothing without the staff that make the NHS what it is today — the institution our nation rightly holds most dear.More than , former nurses, doctors and other NHS staff have heeded the call to re-enlist for the battle against coronavirus.And many thousands of student nurses and medical students will be putting their skills and education into practice early as part of the enormous effort that is under way to save more lives.But the NHS cannot win this war alone. Companies and the Government are now pulling together to get us the extra equipment and supplies the NHS needs. British manufacturers are retooling production lines to turn out protective kit for doctors, nurses and other staff, giving their all on the front line.Commercial rivalries are being put aside as firms co-operate to develop new ventilators and other vital supplies.Labs are expanding their testing capacity, so NHS staff knowthey can safely get back to work.The public are backing our staff at this time of enormous pressure.I know how much it means to the nurses, doctors, therapists, cleaners, pharmacists, paramedics and countless others giving their all to fight coronavirus that the whole nation is behind them in this battle.The support of Sun readers will help sustain them in the days and weeks ahead.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here thesun whocareswinsappealSo on behalf of the NHS, a thank you too to The Sun, for throwing its weight behind the Clap for Carers campaign to give NHS heroes the recognition they deserve.But the practical actions that iniduals and families take in the weeks ahead will also make all the dference.As other countries have shown, no health service in the world could cope with the number of patients who would need treatmentbetween us we failed to slow the spread of coronavirus.That is why the Government’s measures to stop people meeting and passing on the virus are so important.Nobody is finding this easy — whether it is missing a drink with friends in the pub, Sunday lunch with the family or uncertainty over jobs and wages this epidemic has created for so many.There are early signs this is working but this is a marathon not a sprint. What we need to remember is that right now every single one of us can be a le-saver just by following the medical advice.Every time you wash your hands you could keep someone off of a ventilator. Over the coming weeks, by staying at home you save lives. It’s as simple and as profound as that. This is truly a national effort.Each and every one of us has to play our part.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Since Boris Johnson declared the lockdown restrictions on our lives, officers have been accused by some of being overzealous enforcing them.They have tried to stop some shops selling Easter eggs because they consider them non-essential.A cop was also filmed threatening to fine a bakery owner for putting chalk on the pavement outside her shop to maintain social-distancing.Meanwhile, the Derbyshire force dyed black the Blue Lagoon swim spot in a disused Buxton quarry to deter groups from gathering there — and sent out drones to spy on walkers in the middle of nowhere.Road blocks have been set up to check motorists and cyclists are on essential journeys.Last weekend officers were also breaking up groups of more than two people on park benches, and football matches in parks.All of which could seem a tad heavy-handed.So you can see why some people are indignant, especially given the absence of clearer official guidance.Perhaps it is this lack of clarity that is partly the issue.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a recent daily press conference that police should use common sense in applying the rules and that the public should follow the guidance not just to the letter but also the spirit.The real issue, though, is some people’s inability to follow the very basic instruction to stay at home unless they really need to go out.If people were not disregarding this advice, police would not have to enforce it.Officers do need to be careful, though.We are willing to social-distance for the greater good but only as long as it is necessary — and will not tolerate it for a minute longer.We are not a police state and the police must be mindful of being too heavy-handed.So while shouting at someone for buying an Easter egg is ridiculous and using a drone to terrorise a lone dog walker does seem extreme, someone has to break up the cretins who are having barbecues or parties in high-density residential areas, right I do despair over the attitude of those mindless idiots who are still having parties and getting drunk together.Then there are the twits going to DIY shops to buy paint, which is hardly essential.People, this is not an extended Bank Holiday. It is a lockdown.It is being done to save your le or the le of someone you love.The bottom line is that officers have to ensure the guidelines are adhered to, but it is how they go about it that is important.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here thesun whocareswinsappealIn the meantime, police chiefs are urging snoopers to use online hotlines to tell tales about neighbours who are breaching the Government’s lockdown.Humberside has created a dedicated online portal where people can submit tip-offsthey spot gatherings of more than two people.West Midlands, Greater Manchester, and Avon and Somerset are urging the public to alert them to breaches by using online forums, rather than phoning  or .To my mind, this raises ethical questions.hould we really become a nation of snitches Should we not all just concentrate on our own families and trust that others will take care of themselves Is the act of reporting the selfish idiots who disregard the Government advice really community spirit Or is it just the ultimate curtain-twitching exercise — which encourages serious pettiness Apparently, the police have had calls from people asking them to come and arrest a neighbour for going on a second run in one day.In an ideal world we would all just abide by the rules and there would be no need to report others.Sadly, though, needs must.If your neighbour is driving to the seaside when you are stuck indoors at home, they are ruining the purpose of this lockdown for everyone, they are selfish and they should be stopped.If people do not abide by the rules, what choice do you have Butyou do just stay home there will be no need to worry about whether your neighbours are phoning the police about you.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day -

This is nowhere near good enough.As Boris Johnson croaked from his sick bed, mass testing among the general population is the ONLY way out of this national purgatory.But at the moment we do not even have widespread testing among our NHS workers.Right now we are letting down those selfless doctors, nurses and health carers.On Thursday night at pm, my street in North London resounded to the sound of grateful clapping for our carers.But as our frontline health workers start to die, they need more than a weekly standing ovation.They need us to understand that the lockdown rules apply to us all.Lucy Hutchings, , is a nurse caring for coronavirus patients in Southampton.In a Facebook post, shared , times, she wrote it is “devastating” to see so much suffering when there are still people not following simple rules about staying home, staying safe and protecting the NHS.“I’m scared, everybody I work with is scared,” wrote Lucy, her face etched with exhaustion after another gruelling -hour sht.“The quicker people stay indoors, the quicker it will be over.“I’d like to stay at home but I can’t, so for people to go against the rules is so stupid and irresponsible.“I keep myself away from my mum, dad and brother because I don’t want to pass the virus on. It’s a hard thing to do.”Lucy’s face should haunt us all.Remember it every time some thick-as-mince footballer wraps his expensive motor around a lamppost.Remember Lucy’s face every time you see people who think social isolation rules do not apply to them.Remember Lucy’s faceyou want to understand what a long way we have to go before we truly start supporting the NHS.Yes, it is hard for a people raised in freedom to obey these restrictive rules.But NOBODY has a harder job right now than those NHS workers who are risking their lives in under-equipped, overcrowded hospitals that are being pushed to breaking point and beyond.The health crisis is unprecedented in our letime but the Government cannot keep cocking it up.The NHS does not have the kit it needs, the testing it needs, the support it needs.Health Secretary Matt Hancock promises , coronavirus tests a day by the end of April.If Hancock does not deliver, get shot of him.Because right now, that “Protect the NHS” slogan is looking heartbreakingly empty.All foreign NHS workers who are out there now fighting on the frontline deserve British passports.If these foreign heroes are good enough to risk their lives to save our lives, then they have earned the right to stay in the UK for ever.CLAUDIA Schfer tells Elle magazine that at the height of her supermodel glory days she felt like a rock star.

Honesty.She promised viewers it “might be a bit rough around the edges”, and has been utterly faithful to her word, starting last Monday, when Steph went hurtling round her house to show off the remote cameras and then spent the next ten minutes gasping for air.Over the following  minutes, Skype links maled, mobile phones went off and an attempt to kick off a feature about weird dreams, with Keith Lemon, was shut down as quickly as it started.“What did you ask Michael Hutchence in your dream ”“Things he did romantically with Kylie Minogue that . . . ” “OK, let’s move on.”Had you thought day two was going to improve things, you probably banished those thoughts when Steph began with her own epitaph: “If you tuned in yesterday, you’ll know this is the show that isn’t meant to be on yet.”Or any other day for that matter, although Tuesday’s episode was a technical cracker and climaxed when someone rang Steph’s doorbell, mid-episode.

This is the opposite of Covid-.“Data on the benefit of school closures in the COVID- outbreak is limited but what we know shows that their impact is likely to be only small compared to other infection control measures such as case isolation and is only effective when other social isolating measures are adhered to.“Additionally, the costs of national school closures are high – children’s education is damaged and their mental health may suffer, family finances are affected, key workers may need to stay home to look after children and vulnerable children may suffer most.”Prof Viner said policymakers need to be aware of the evidence when considering closures because of the “profound and long lasting effect” they will have on children.He added: “Countries that have closed schools, such as the UK, have to now ask hard questions about when and how to open schools.“Interventions in schools, such as closing playgrounds, keeping students in constant class groups classrooms increasing spacing between students in classes, reducing the school week and staggering school start and break times across years or classes, should be considered,restrictive social distancing policies are to be implemented for long periods of time.”The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealRobert Halfon, chair of the Commons Education Committee, yesterday said he believes there will be staged reopenings of schools when the pandemic begins to ease.The Tory MP said: “We are walking hand-grenades potentially at the moment in the way that we can spread this disease.“And that is what lies I think behind the Government’s decision [to impose a lockdown].

he even handed over pictures of himself in shorts and a vest to a TV channel use for their profile of him.The Foreign Secretary has a poster of Muhammad Ali in his House of Commons office and still trains at his local boxing club in Surrey.Former Brexit Secretary David Davis was more impressed with Mr Raabs karate black belt than his TWO degrees - an undergraduate from Oxford and a masters from Cambridge - when he gave him the job as his chief of staff.Mr Raab has said he turned to karate to help him deal with the grief of losing his father when he was only twelve.His father, Peter, fled to the UK from Czechoslovakia when he was just six-years-old to escape the Nazis, but died of cancer when Mr Raab was a boy.It wasnt the last tragedy to strike a young Mr Raab - his mother later died by suicide.He said last year: Sport helped restore my confidence, and that hugely benefited my attitude to school and le.There were strong role models, camaraderie and an ethos of respect.I take the discipline and focus I learnt from sport into my professional le - and I believe that approach is vital to making a success of the Brexit negotiations and delivering a fairer deal from Brussels.During the leadership campaign he released pictures of his Jewish relatives who were murdered in the Holocaust and paid tribute to his dads incredible story.Peter Raab escaped from his home country, being forced to leave most of his family behind to be murdered for their beliefs.The stand-in PM was born in Buckinghamshire, grew up in Gerrards Cross and went to Dr Challoners Grammar School, before going to Oxford University.The importance of respect he learnt from boxing and karate translated into his political career, and he was upset by civil servants who anonymously described him as a bully when he was the Brexit Secretary.He denied claims by his former diary secretary that he insisted on the same Pret a Manger lunch every day.His daily order was apparently a chicken Caesar salad, bacon baguette, superfruit pot and vitamin volcano smoothie - a meal fit for a boxer.Mr Raab, who is the MP for the seat of Esher and Walton, ran against the PM to be Tory party leader after Theresa May resigned.Hes served in his current post since July .Before that he had a very brief stint as the Brexit Secretary but quit in protest of Mrs Mays plans for Brexit.Altogether hes had just over one year of Cabinet experience - eight months under Mr Johnson, and five for Mrs May.Mr Raab was given his First Secretary and Foreign Secretary gig after he backed down from the Tory leadership.Many politicians and pundits expected him to be given a good spot - but not the second top job.But Mr Raab is a hardline Brexiteer, and his position in Cabinet makes sense given Boris promise to get Brexit done.He was one of the most vocal supporters of leaving the EU and his appointment gave other Brexiteers the conviction in the PM to really deliver on Brexit.But Downing Street made clear the First Secretary would step inthe PM needed him to.Since taking up the post Mr Raab had to wade into the thorny diplomatic controversy over the death of British teenager Harry Dunn.The teen was killed when his motorbike crashed into a car near Northamptonshire in August last year.The young boys parents tried to heckle Mr Raab at a constituency hustings because they felt he hadnt helped get justice for their son by failing to pursuade the US to extradite Harrys alleged killer - Anne Sacoolas.He has also had to manage the controversial issue of repatriation of children of British jihadists.He got himself into hot water in May  when he said that people who use food banks are not typically in poverty but have an occasional cashflow problem.Critics labelled the remarks stupid and deeply offensive.Last year, he threatened to keep open the option of suspending Parliament to prevent MPs blocking Brexit.He was the target of a relentless campaign in his Surrey seat in last years election and was almost ousted.His previous majority of , votes was shrunk to just , -

I have dementia. Am I classed as vulnerable or high risk A. Dementia does not put you at greater physical risk of coronavirus but the way in which dementia might affect you could potentially put you in harm’s way. For example, it might be easier to forget that you should not have visitors or have close contact with somebody making deliveries to your door.Routines like hand washing might not be thorough enough. Stay home, physically distance and make a list of the things you need to do to keep yourself safe.Q. When do you expect people will build up enough antibodies not to catch the virus a second time A. We cannot be sure yet how long immunity takes to be established and how long it lasts because this is a very new virus. It is thought that antibodies will be measurable after about  days. Immunity should be present straight after the acute illness when symptoms have disappeared. Q. Can you catch the virus from hanging your washing out on the line A. No. You should be absolutely safe doing this. The virus needs a human host and fresh air kills it quickly.Q. Is it still safe to cuddle and kiss my cat A. The virus does not easily jump species and I have seen no evidence that cats and dogs have become unwell with this infection. If somebody with the virus sneezed or coughed over your pet there is a slight chance the virus could be transmitted from their fur to you. Frequent hand washing should take care of that and you can safely cuddle your pets.Q. I work on a supermarket checkout and have Achalasia. Am I in the high risk group and should I be working A. You are not in a high-risk group. Your condition is mainly a digestive one. You just need to take the same precautions as everyone .Q. I work for MS. After every sht I shower and wash my work clothes. I have heard that I have to wash my hair too. Is this correct A. The chances of any coronavirus to which you have been exposed living for anyof time on your hair is very remote. Clinically speaking I don’t think there is a need to wash your hair every day.Q. Can you catch coronavirus from people vaping A. The virus is present in the exhaled breath of someone who is infected. The vapour from vaping liquids would neither make ithe virus more transmissible nor kill it off. The same would apply to cigarettes.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Q. I have aches in my neck, a sore throat and a tickly cough. Is this just a normal cold or should I isolate A. If the tickly cough is dry, unproductive of phlegm, persis- tent and not something you have had before you should self- isolate to be on the safe side.Q. I’m suffering bad anxiety and my chest is uncomfortable. I’m scared it’s coronavirus. What should I do A. Many people are very anxious at the moment and that often causes altered breathing. Some people breathe too fast when they feel panicky and others just become overly conscious of what is normally an unconscious activity. In the absence of other symptoms, try to relax, distract your mind from worry, exercise gently and phone a trusted friend to share your feelings.Q. How do I get my monthly prescriptions delivered  I am over , plus have an underlying illness.A. Contact your usual pharmacy, where your regular prescriptions are issued. Many have already set up a delivery service to people in your position and in the last few days the Government’s health and social care secretary has pledged millions of pounds to assist this process for other chemists. You should not need to worry about supplies.Q. I have heard people who have had the virus are being told they canto work after seven days. Is this long enoughthey are still coughing A. The guidance isyou live alone and have been self-isolating for seven days then feel completely well you can resume your normal activities. This is true evenyou still have a dry cough as it is considered you will no longer be shedding the virus when you cough.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A third admitted they were proud when their child made a move toward independence.Nearly a quarterfelt broadsided and didn’t see the moment coming when they realized their child was maturing.Still, for every step forward, there are other moments that leave parents cringing. The average age a child was most likely to embarrass their parents was  years old.From acting like a dog and licking food out of a bowl at a restaurant to running through a fountain at the mall, kids have a knack for creating memorable scenes.Among the most common embarrassing moments for parents were shouting inappropriate things in public , undressing in publicand accidentally taking something from a store without paying for it .Although memorable, these frightful or embarrassing moments, combined with key milestones along the way, can often be forgotten as time goes on, said Leslie Albertson, Director of Marketing at Mixbook.“Capturing these moments in time in a photo book or print allows you to relive them for years to come, likely with a laugh or tear. It’s an incredibly powerful way to maintain your memories.The reign of terror doesn’t last forever though, as the average parent reported seeing their child as a friend by the age of .Parents tend to collect the most keepsakes when their child is about  years old and they’ll store up a plethora of items.The average parent stores up  pictures,  homemade cards,  family photos and  videos of major le events.Some parents even keep some highly personal things from their children like hair and baby teeth.Of course, parents have to find creative ways of keeping their little mementos safe. Over half keep a photo book or album while % have a display on their wall.Forty-six percent have invested in a wall print made of canvas or metal and three in  turn their keepsakes into ornaments.“As parents, we’re constantly receiving kids artwork and crafts. It’s impossible to keep every single piece and you can’t help but feel a little guilty just tossing them and hurting their feelings, Albertson added.Turning all that artwork into more lasting keepsakes like prints or adding them into a photo book are great ways to maintain those little mementos without all the clutter or the guilt.

Peterborough council today announced it was transferring staff from bulky waste collections to black bin refuse and recycling collection to cope with the pressure from Covid-. Councillor Marco Cereste, cabinet member for waste at Peterborough City Council, said: “This is not a decision we take lightly and we are not alone as a city in doing this. At a time when everyone is quite rightly staying at home to protect the NHS, it is essential that we continue collecting people’s bins.

The council said they would revisit the suspension in four weeks.

Black bins food waste are considered high priority. The government says these should be maintained because a build up of rotting waste can pose a risk to human health. Fortnightly recycling services are considered aposmediumapos priority, with councils urged to consider reducing the frequency of collections rather than stopping them entirely.

But the coronavirus crisis has brought the UK’s fuzzy, unwritten constitution into focus - with many people confused about who is actually in charge. And even with Dominic Raab filling in for the PM in cabinet meetings and other duties, it’s unclear how far his powers reach. And it’s far from certain who would replace the Prime Ministerhe dies suddenly or is incapacitated for a long period. In the United States, which has a strict written constitution, there are well developed procedures in place for when a President is incapacitated. There’s a legal line of succession, running from the Vice President, through the Speaker of the House and President pro tempore of the Senate, then right the way through the Cabinet. Currently, some  people would have to die or be incapacitated before Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson became President. In fact, that’s more or less the plot of the TV show Designated Survivor. But in this country, we have neither a strict, written constitution nor a legal line of succession so everything becomes a little more…murky. Here’s what we know. Does Boris Johnson have a deputy   When he formed his first cabinet, Boris Johnson chose not to have a formal Deputy Prime Minister. It’s not a requirement, and most PMs don’t. David Cameron had Nick Clegg as his deputy, but that was mostly to keep the coalition government afloat. Instead, there’s a slightly vague convention that the First Secretary of State deputises for the PMthey can’t do the job. First Secretary of State isn’t really a job - it’s a title someone has to imply seniority over other Cabinet ministers. It’s also worth remembering that even though Nick Clegg was Cameron’s Deputy PM - he named former Tory leader William Hague First Secretary of State. Currently, the title belongs to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. Number  said last night that Boris Johnson had asked Mr Raab to deputise for him “ necessary.” Who takes overDominic Raab becomes ill  This afternoon the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman saidMr Raab became incapacitated, then rookie Chancellor Rishi Sunak would take over from him. The spokesman said: There is an established order of precedence. The Prime Minister has you know appointed the Foreign Secretary as his First Secretary of State. In line with the order of precedence the Chancellor would follow from the Foreign Secretary.Why isn’t there an official deputy  Because - technically - the country is run by the Cabinet rather than the PM alone. The Prime Minister is supposed to be ‘first among equals’ in the Cabinet. Can Dominic Raab reshuffle the cabinet in Boris Johnson’s absence  Apparently not. The PMaposs official spokesman was askedMr Raab could do any hiring and firing of ministers in the Prime Ministeraposs absence. He replied: The short answer to that is no.  Who’s in charge of the nuclear weaponsthe PM is incapacitated  That’s a very good question. In theory, Dominic Raab as First Secretary of State could authorise military action - but he would most likely have to obtain the support of senior cabinet ministers to do so. Boris Johnsonaposs official spokesman said: In relation to national security matters the First Secretary of State and the Cabinet have the authority and ability to respond in the Prime Ministeraposs absence. The UK has robust national security architecture, including the National Security Council , which is designed to be resilient and able to operate effectively under dferent circumstances. Should any NSC be required the Foreign Secretary would chair it. He added: In relation to nationa security decisions are taken by the Cabinet. The Foreign secretary would chair any Cabinet meeting. There’s also the question of the so-called ‘letters of last resort’ - which the PM writes to give instructions to nuclear commanders in case he’s killed in an attack. Number  say Mr Raab has not been asked to write letters of his own, because the Prime Minister remains the Prime Minister. ButMr Johnson is out of action for a long time - orhe stepped down - someone  may be asked to write letters of their own. Will Dominic Raab take over Boris Johnsonaposs weekly audience with the Queen  No. Number  say the Queen and Buckingham Palace have been in constant contact and are getting updates on the PMaposs condition. But instead of Mr Raab having a weekly  meeting with the monarch, as the PM usually does, senior officials - specically Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill and the Prime Ministeraposs Principal Private Secretary will continue contact with the royal household on his behalf. What happensBoris Johnson dies or steps down  In either case, a new Prime Minister would have to be appointed by the Queen. Usually, the Queen instructs the leader of the largest party to form a government - but that wouldn’t automatically be Dominic Raab. It would be up to the cabinet to recommend an immediate successor to the Queen. The Tory rulebook requires the party to hold a leadership electionthe PM dies in office. But there’s no official ‘acting’ or ‘interim’ Prime Minister role. Whoever the Queen approves is full-on Prime Minister. It would be up to them to resign as PM once the leadership election is completed and a new party leader is selected.

According to distraught mum Jade Watson doctors initially ruled Covid- out but tests the next day confirmed the virus, she said. Winter-Rose was placed on a drip and left to fight for her le, as experts told the mum-of-two there was nothing  they could do. Miraculously, within  hours the babyaposs condition had improved so drastically she was allowed tohome, where she remains in recovery now. Jade, , from Burnley, Lancs., said: It was the worst experience of my entire le, I was so scared. To see my baby struggling like that was so painful, I couldnapost believe what was happening. Iaposm so grateful she was able to pull through. Jade is speaking about her ordeal to warn other parents about being vigilant and staying indoors, following reports babies were not as susceptible to the virus. The single mum, who also has a six-year-old son, said: “On Thursday she had a really bad temperature, it was about . degrees. “So I contacted  and they advised me to stay at home.  But at about am on Friday I’d set my alarm to check on her and she’d got really warm, even more than she was before. I didn’t even need to touch her, there was heat just coming off her. She was gasping for breath. I called for an ambulance but it took around three hours to get here. Her temperature had gone down slightly but it was still .. Winter-Rose was taken to Royal Blackburn Hospital. Jade said it was heartbreaking to see her little girl in so much pain but it was made worse by the fact she had to go through the ordeal alone, without the comfort of having her family and friends around her. The single mum claims upon arrival at the hospital with her daughter a senior doctor told her babies did not get Covid- and they would not be testing the  week old. She said: “That really upset me, and they could see that.  A consultant said he still wanted to give her a test though and they put a cannula in her hand and tried to put a catheter in her too, it was heartbreaking.” It usually takes  to  hours for a coronavirus test to come back, so while doctors waited for the results, Jade says they carried out other checks and placed Winter-Rose on antibiotics to try to bring her fever down.She added: They put needles in her spine to check for meningitis and gave her antibiotics, but they didnapost work.And on Saturday morning the doctor came and told me she had tested positive for coronavirus. It was the worst thing in the world to hear. She was on a drip to try to get her fluids back up but there was nothing  they could do to help her fight it. Over the weekend, Winter-Roseaposs condition improved and she was allowed to go back to her home in Burnley on Monday morning, where Jade was told to isolate with the -week-old for  days.  Jade said: Sheaposs still got the virus and I donapost knowIaposve had it or not, as the only symptom I had was a headache that wouldnapost go away, even after taking headache pills. My son was with me a couple of days before Winter went into hospital, but now he has to isolate with his dad at his home as we donapost knowhe could have it too. Itaposs been such a dficult time as Iaposve not been able to have anyone come and visit. Even when I was in the hospital I was on my own, it was hard. You need support at times like this, but with this whole situation, it must be so dficult for people who are in hospital alone, not having anyone to come and visit them.  That was the hardest thing - having no-one to support me at the hospital. I did receive a lot of nice messages from people online though. That was quite overwhelming, and made me cry but itaposs what got me through. Jade said doctors are continuing to check on Winter-Roseaposs condition every day, and family members drop food and other items outside her house. She added: Thereaposs been talk of this virus not affecting babies the same way as others, but it does, and it has affected Winter so much. I had never seen her looking so helpless.  Iaposd only been out of the house really to go to Lidl and Home Bargains but people need to listen to the advice, and stay indoors. Dr Chris Gardner, Deputy Medical Director and Consultant Paediatrician at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: We do not comment on inidual cases but we are pleased to report that no babies or children cared for at the trust have needed oxygen or any respiratory support as a result of Covid- in keeping with the fact that this virus generally causes only a mild illness in children. We are however ready and able to provide all additional support including stabilisation, ventilation and transfer to intensive care and have good links with specialist children’s centres around the country for any future children who may require this. We would also like to reiterate the plea for people to stay at home to protect themselves and others. If you do need to go out please observe social distancing guidelines, and make sure you wash your hands thoroughly and frequently.

The gremlin took hold, he kept saying he couldnapost wait for it to be over and that he wanted to fast forward it all. Kian held a black belt in kickboxing and was a former member of WCKA kickboxing club in Rhigos.

He did have an air of shyness but he was very polite. He thought of everybody and anybody and he loved being out and about. He was just amazing. He was an immense, incredible big brother to Darcey, he had her back all the time. We didnapost expect this at all. We constantly talk and we encourage the kids to talk, we donapost hide anything. Kian knew itaposs okay not to be okay and he didnapost talk. We will never know why. By speaking out after Kianaposs death, the teenageraposs family want to encourage others to talk about their worries and seek support. Jolene said: People have been messaging saying their children have done it or attempted to or people have said they have lost people of the same age when they were young. You know itaposs out there but when it doesnapost affect you it doesnapost hit home. There are gremlins out there and it changes our kids. It has to stop. I just need people to talk, I need them to know itaposs okay not to be okay and that people really really love you and want to talk. Thereaposs numbersyou canapost talk to loved ones.

He pointed out that Italy, which appears to have already experienced a peak in cases, remained in lockdown, and we were about three weeks behind in terms of the trajectory of the virus. This means the UKaposs measures would likely prevail for at least three weeks after Italyaposs are lted. Dr Varneyaposs comments echoed the message from  Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab,  currently at the helm while Prime Minister Boris Johnson is in intensive care fighting the virus.Mr Raab said today the  worst thing the country could do was “take its foot off the peddle”. When the lockdown was announced last month, Boris Johnson said the unprecedented measure would be reviewed after three weeks. But the UK is not in a position where it is safe to reduce the rules, the public was told. Mr Raab said: “In terms of the review, we are not at that stage yet.  “We will take any decision when the time is right, based on the facts and the scientic and medical advice.  “Our number one and overriding focus right now is on conveying the key message which is that everyone needs to keep adhering to this guidance.  “There is a long Easter bank holiday weekend coming up, warm weather and we understand people are making big sacrices to follow this guidance. Hospitals across the country are gearing up for an expected peak in the virus over the next two weeks."},{"url":null,"title":"dad being treated coronavirus heard","story":"NewsDad being treated for coronavirus heard patient crying out for family as he died aloneCraig Farley-Jones, a dad-of-two from Greater Manchester, spent six days in hospital on maximum oxygen battling the virus when he heard the anguished pleas from another patient oppositeShareCommentsByTui Benjamin:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video dominic-raab-the-number-people-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news dad-being-treated-coronavirus-heard-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Craig Farley-Jones listened to the man in his late sixties calling out the names of his relatives for two hours before he passed away at Tameside General Hospital last week. Dad-of-two Craig spent six days in hospital on maximum oxygen battling the virus - at one point texting fiancé Laura Wilson, , to ask why he hadnapost written a will as she had suggested - before recovering enough to be discharged on Sunday. But the -year-old, who was fit and well with no pre-existing health conditions, was left heartbroken at the fate of other patients in his quarantined ward. His heartfelt social media post reminding people still not taking the UKaposs lockdown seriously that the potentially-deadly virus can affect anyone has racked up more than , likes and shares online. Craig, from Hyde, Greater Manchester, said: Everyone in the ward looked like death, but the man in the bed opposite me who was about  or  was relaxed and talkative to start with, despite being on maximum oxygen. Later that day I could see he was struggling to breathe and starting to panic, I could see he was getting distressed so I buzzed the nurses but they couldnapost calm him down. Something had changed - his stats went off the scale and it was past the point offor him. They gave him something to calm him down and called for his kids, as this was obviously his final night. His children were at least able to come in in masks and gowns and say their goodbyes, but he still hung on for another few hours after that. I will never forget those next two hours for as long as I live. He was shouting out, calling for his family by name, over and over while struggling to breathe. It had me in tears, it was so hard to listen to.  I buzzed the nurses, but they told me there was nothing more they could do for him. So I lay there listening to his breathing turning into a death rattle, he continued calling out into it stopped and was quiet - he had gone. I know he wasnapost in physical pain at that point, but he was definitely in emotional distress. I wouldnapost have let a dog die like that. Itaposs not the fault of the doctors and nurses at all, they were doing everything they could, but in some cases it isnapost enough. People need to know when you go into hospital with coronavirus, all the NHS can do is remove any infection that accompanies the virus to give you the best chance to fight it yourself. They canapost treat the virus itself - soyou end up in hospital you have to fight for yourself, or sink. So please, stay at home and hold onto your loved ones - Iaposm one of the lucky ones.  Craig and Laura both noticed symptoms on the same day two weeks ago but are not sure where they caught the virus. As soon as the UKaposs lockdown came into force last month their family adhered to the Government advice but both began to a suffer a high temperature, nausea and exhaustion about three days afterwards. The couple both also developed a loss of smell and bad cough but when Craig began struggling to breathe last Tuesday he called NHS  and was rushed to via ambulance to hospital, where it was discovered the illness had spread to his lungs, causing pneumonia. At am on his third night in hospital, Craig was taken from one of the main wards to a dferent quarantined coronavirus unit by wheelchair after testing positive for Covid-. The businessman, who was treated with antibiotics for secondary infections during his hospital stay, was unable to eat for a week during his ordeal, losing a stone in weight.  Craig said: When I got to hospital, I thought I was safe. But I still felt like I couldnapost breathe, and when I realised that was still the case when the oxygen was on maximum full pelt, that was a scary moment. I just couldnapost breathe, and thought I could be that close. The feeling of claustrophobia and panic that sets in is frightening - even a few days later when I was feeling better and due to be discharged, I still had a nagging doubt I might not make it.

Linda, , and Alan Price, , from Upminster, Essex, started documenting their daily adventures after the global pandemic of Covid- put them into home isolation for  weeks. The couple, who have been married for  years, choose a new theme each day, and upload photos to their Facebook page called aposKeeping Up with the Prices Isolation Adventuresapos. So far they’ve enjoyed a game of cricket and a romantic meal in the kitchen, taken their china dog for a walk while wearing crash helmets, and battled dragons in a Game Of Thrones-inspired duel. Mrs Price said they are currently mourning the loss of Alan’s sister Eve, who died after contracting Covid-, but they are thrilled to be bringing a smile to people’s faces. She said: It started off as a laugh between the family so my daughter decided to share it with her Facebook friends. We had so many comments and likes encouraging us to make daily adventures to uplt people and give them a laugh! My daughter thought it would be a good idea to set up a page for us so we could bring a smile to even more people’s faces plus it keeps our spirits up when we read the wonderful comments.  Mrs Price said: Our most sentimental day was last nightaposs isolation adventure as it was dedicated to my sister-in-law who has just lost her le to Coronavirus. The couple shared a post dedicated to their loss, writing on Facebook: As many of you may know we lost our dear Auntie Eve last night to Coronavirus, she was a mum, nan, sister-in-law and Alan’s sister. As our family grieves, Alan and Linda want to continue to make you all smile and this is their way of dedicating and keeping Eve’s memory alive and for all the people who have lost their le to this terrible virus. So Boris let us shout out there will always be an England and it’s not goodbye it’s until we meet again. The former retail assistant and retired site manager, who fans saw celebrate Eve’s le with a British-themed afternoon tea, have their daughter Nicole Adams to thank for creating their social media page. She joked she now feels like her parents’ PA and secretary after thousands of comments have made them local celebrities. The Facebook page so far has more than  followers and includes snaps of how the retired elderly couple are maintaining their high spirits during the crisis.  Fans of the page have seen photos of the couples dressed in their wedding day attire, as well as with Elvis records, wearing bandanas, holding blow-up guitars and with flowers in their hair. They’ve also taken a virtual flight to the Caribbean and home-schooled each other with a geography lesson. Mrs Price: We cannot put into words just how amazing people have been and what a dference we have made to people’s lives. Especially to key workers who have had a particularly bad day to come home and see what we have been up to and bring a smile to their face. It goes to show just how lovely and kind the British public is. We are having a laugh with each other and know it’s not forever and we are counting each day until we get to see our family again. The couple said they wake up every morning and discuss the day’s theme over their morning coffee.  Mrs Price said: We sit and discuss what we should do. One morning, we realised we had our grandson’s toy dragons here from when he was little so we decided to do a Game of Thrones day. We didn’t know much about it so we went on the internet for research. It makes our days go by so much quicker and keeps us entertained for hours.  The Prices’ documented their Game of Thrones day on their Facebook page, writing: ‘Day  of isolation. Well Boris, it’s a kind of Game of Thrones type of day featuring the mother of the dragons Queen Daenerys Targaryen aka Linda and her nephew Jon Snow aka Alan fighting off the dragons...Keep safe everyone!’ Some of their other adventures include a ‘ Netflix  Chill’ day in bed, taking photos as they pretended to complete a two-mile jog around their garden keeping their social distance with a homemade two-metre stick and a day of cooking Gino DaposCampo style.

Bridget, from Wavertree, Merseyside, had been widowed decades ago and never had children. Her heartbroken niece, -year-old Sakina Ali, was unable able to visit her before she died. So Bridget told a hospital worker to deliver a final message to her niece: Tell Sakina. I love her. Sakina said: She was in the rehab centre and she was getting ready to come home. She had pneumonia but she was on the mend, as much as a woman of her age could be. But then we got a call saying she had been taken to Aintree. They told us she would probably not last the night but she ended up hanging in there for around  days.  She was a very formidable woman, she was still a whizz kid on the computer before she died, she had been doing all research on her family history. Sakinaaposs daughter, who did not wish to be named, said her family were desperate to see Bridget, but knew the risks were too great. She said: That was the heartbreaking thing really. My mum was devastated. My son said aposshall I just go and see herapos but his partner was pregnant. Just before she died she asked the occupational therapist to apostell Sakira I love herapos. At that point I think we knew.  Bridget left school at the age of  without a formal education, but managed to self-publish two books in her later years. She moved to London in her youth where she married Lason Richards, a Jamaican native who died decades ago. Even with the pain of losing her Auntie, Sakina has been determined to do her bit to aid the fight against coronavirus. With her shop, which sells jewellery, crystals and spiritual and religious trinkets, forced to close, Sakina and her daughter decided to help tackle the widspread shortage of Personal Protective Equipment . Using her sewing machine and fabric from her shop, Sakina began crafting home-made face masks for NHS staff, other key workers andtheir families. Her daughter spread the message on Facebook and Instagram, and within days Sakina was bombarded with requests.She says by the morning she will have posted out  self made face masks. She said: The stories we have heard are heartbreaking. We have heard from doctors and nurses and ambulance drivers. They just donapost have enough, and eventhey have some for themselves there is nothing for their families. There are people who suffer with anxiety and depression and sometimes the mask just gives them that bit of confidence to go out and have awalk.Her daughter added: She has boundless energy and decided to put to use her sewing and manufacturing skills. At the age of  she started working in sewing factories in Liverpool so had a wealth of experience and a room full of fabric.She put a notice on her Facebook and Instagram page for a free Cotton mask thinking that she would make about  masks and pay to post themherself."},{"url":null,"title":"google paid uk staff 1bn","story":"NewsGoogle paid UK staff £bn last year - but just £m in corporation taxThe workforce for the web giant jumped from , to , in , taking its outlay on salaries, share-based rewards and other staff costs to £billionShareCommentsByGraham HiscottHead of Business:,  APR NewsGoogles stated corporation tax bill fell from almost £million to just under £million \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

However the company paid less UK corporation tax last year, despite a near £million leap in revenues. The US-based company’s stated bill fell from almost £million to just under £million, after profits at its main UK-based firm dropped from £million to £million. That was partly because it went on a hiring spree, including taking on nearly  extra staff in research and development, and handed out more in share-based rewards to employees.Meanwhile, Google UK’s revenues rocketed from just over £.billion to almost £.billion.The money comes from Google UK providing “marketing services” and research and development for other parts of the online heavyweight. It does not include the bulk of Google’s business – lucrative advertising sales – which have traditionally been booked in Ireland. Paul Monaghan, chief executive of the Fair Tax Mark, said: “Once again, it seems like Google are writing their own rules in the UK. “Income is up in , but corporation tax charges are down. That’s before the ongoing puzzle of how they get away with booking so little of their UK advertising revenue through their UK subsidiary. “Advertising analysts estimate the revenue raised in the UK is four times greater than that booked by the UK arm of Google, at £.billion.The UK’s proposed % Digital Services Tax on income barely scratches the surface of what is a fair tax contribution.” "},{"url":null,"title":"host who didnt believe coronavirus","story":"NewsParty host fined for birthday bash tells police I dont believe in coronavirusDerbyshire Police attended an th birthday party after receiving noise complaints, but say officers were greeted by a guest telling them he did not believe in the coronavirusShareCommentsByJosh PayneJamie Hawkins:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsPolice are cracking down on Brits who are breaking social distancing measures \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Elena Sotiriou, , who lives in Upminster, east London, claims she was told by the manager of her local Iceland she would have to leave the store during the Covid- lockdown. The mum-of-two, who was shopping with her children Georgia, seven, and Ioannis Marino, four, says she was told ‘kids are not allowed’.She added that she would use online shopping except that when she last checked, the next available slot wasnapost until the end of April. However, Iceland have told the Mirror that the employee must have misinterpreted their rules as there is aposno ban on bringing children into stores where parents have no alternative but to bring their children with them.aposWriting on Facebook, Miss Sotiriou said: I went to collect my medication from Boots as Iceland is just a few doors away and I have always done my shopping there as the charity shop I work at is just a few shops away and itaposs so convenient.I am a regular customer and had no bread or milk and some other stuff I needed.

Iaposm a single mum, we have no relatives here at all in the UK - their grandparents, aunties and dad are all back in Cyprus - so it is just me and them. Miss Sotiriou, who is a charity shop volunteer, said she kept her children as close as possible as she entered the shop and started doing her food shopping. She said she responded ‘kindly’ after she was approached by a member of staff from Iceland and told she was not allowed to do her food shopping. She said: I tried to explain to her, first kindly, that I have no one  to help me with food shopping as Iaposm a single mum and can’t leave my kids home on their own as they are both under age.  Her reply was that she doesn’t make the rules and there is a clear sign at the front of the shop saying children are not allowed. Miss Sotiriou said she was left ‘annoyed’ and felt the rule was unfair on single parents. She said: I have always done my shopping there before and I was good enough before but now in situations like this instead of helping us out they have shut the doors to us. I was angry and told her I wouldnapost be shopping there again and she replied that it’s aposmy problemapos. Despite being told she couldnapost shop there, Miss Sotiriou grabbed her food essentials and went to the till to pay. She said: I complained to the lady working on the till and she said the same thing - that they donapost make the rules and told me to speak to the manager. She pointed to the manager and to my disbelief, the lady I had the argument with was actually the manager. I could not believe it! The lack of customer services. I work on tills myself in the charity shop, so I know what Iaposm talking about and the importance of being nice to customers.’ Miss Sotiriou said she has still not received a response after complaining to Iceland customer service and went home to write a post on her local community group on Facebook.  She said: I then went home - angry and puffing! I found out that I wasnapost the only one complaining. I did some more searching and found out that other shops are doing it too. I think it is unfair and discriminatory.

Miss Sotiriou added: ‘People couldnapost believe how single parents are supposed to feed their kidswe canapost get into the shops.’Supermarkets across the UK have introduced strict rules over the past few weeks to deal with an outbreak of panic buying amid the coronavirus pandemic.Iceland’s opening times have changed, items have been rationed and two-metre distancing has been outlined on shop floors.

Wildle struggles to flourish in the Peak District, Snowdonia and Exmoor as they are so heavily “exploited and degraded,” according to naturalist Benedict Macdonald. Yet areas of habitat in London boroughs such as Peckham burst with le as they are largely left alone. Benedict has worked on some of the UK’s favourite wildle shows, including Springwatch. He said: “Walking through a national park, you should expect a deafening ersity of natural le to greet you. Instead, there is little more than silence. With few exceptions, such as the largely unspoilt New Forest, only small oases of wildle exist within our national parks.” An area comprising three of the capital’s most urbanised boroughs was found to be home to more native birds, mammals, insects and plants.  Parks, docklands and even industrial estates were found to have sustainable breeding populations of threatened species on the RSPB’s red list. The peregrine falcon, a species completely absent from many wild grouse moors, is thriving in cities. Central London is also home to wildflowers, including orchids, and a range of rare species from bitterns to water voles and hedgehogs.

This is a signicant loss for the council and the town, but is nothing compared to the loss her family, close friends and community are feeling right now.

Our death rate seems set to peak imminently. At the weekend, Government advisor, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, suggested it could be within the next seven to  days. Understandably, the questions about what happens when that dreaded curve flattens, are building. Boris Johnson initially said lockdown would be reviewed after the Easter weekend, but foreign secretary Dominic Raab has insisted it is too early to discuss an “exit strategy”, and health secretary Matt Hancock has agreed. And England’s Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty has stressed it is not yet possible to “call the point” at which we start to relax lockdown. A Senior Whitehall source said: “If you talk to the Treasury, they’ll tell you we can do this for another month, two months tops, before we start doing damage to the economy that we won’t be able to undo. “But Health and Downing Street are holding firm – this will last as long as it needs to last until we think we can keep the deaths as low as possible.”  But our appetite for greater freedoms is being whetted by the tempting noises being made by our European neighbours. Austria looks set to become the first EU country to publicly announce plans to lt some restrictions from April , with a second phase from May . In Denmark, there are plans to start reopening nurseries and primary schools from April . Spain has suggested some economic restrictions could be lted after Easter. France has hinted at the possibility of easing lockdown in phases, region by region, “subject to a new testing policy – depending, possibly, on age and other factors”.  And Italy, scene of such horrying scenes, has suggested a “phase ” would have testing at its heart. Further afield, China, too, has highlighted testing and contact tracing – tracking all those with symptoms and anyone they have been in contact with. Strategies here y widely. One is a phased relaxation and civil servants have been asked to draw up options for this kind of segmented release.This could pivot on a region-by-region approach or the gradual expansion of workers regarded as key, or the slow reopening of certain businesses. Prof Andrew Oswald, of the University of Warwick, believes age would be the safest and most effective indicator to use. His suggestion is to initially “release” only  to  year olds from lockdown, as they are the “safest among us”. This would mean . million people – only those who don’t live in the parental home and wouldn’t pose a risk to older people. They are also the group hardest hit by a loss of livelihood. He explained: “It’s quite a simple idea, but it might make a good first stage in an exit strategy... We could restart a fth or a sixth of the economy in this way.”Prof Paul Hunter, of the University of East Anglia, outlines four more “strategies” for leaving lockdown. But none is quick and he can’t see any relaxation being introduced until the end of May. . The herd immunity model The first is reliant on knowing the percentage of herd immunity in the country. Once that has reached  or %, he says – not necessarily the height needed to stop infection spread – he believes lockdown could be reduced. But, critically, he said, “only testing will allow us to know that data.” And the antibody test being promoted by the Government about a week ago, which checkssomeone has recovered from Covid-, looks to be nowhere near ready for roll out. None checked so far has met “the criteria for a good test”. . The tracing model Prof Hunter outlines a second strategy as following China’s tracing model – seemingly also preferred by Germany. But this first depends on numbers reducing considerably and, again, testing availability. He explained: “You keep the lockdown until there are few,any, cases and this is followed by rigorous contact tracing and isolation of cases, and their contacts when they are identied.” "},{"url":null,"title":"parents love mums magical jar","story":"NewsParents love mums magical jar to keep children happy in lockdownKatie Eborall wanted to find a way to say yes to the things her children Max, five, and Evie, two, wanted to do during the coronavirus lockdown - so created a bucket list jarShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsAudience Writer:,  APR NewsKatie says her son is struggling with missing his friends and weekly activities \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

When all this is over this will be our bucket list and we’ll work our way through the jar and be more grateful than ever for the little and lovely things in our lives.

CPAP uses pressure to send a blend of air and oxygen into the mouth at a steady rate, thereby boosting the amount of oxygen that enters the lungs. But Prof Hill said many Covid- patients eventually #xCprogress to invasive ventilation#xD. This is for people whose illness is so severe they are struggling or unable to breathe for themselves. A mechanical ventilator either does all the breathing for the patient, or assists the patient#xs own breathing. The patient is heavily sedated while a device called an endotracheal tubeis guided through the mouth into the windpipe. Heavy sedation is then continued because having a tube in the throat can be very uncomfortable. Patients can be fed at the same time through a tube going into their stomach via their nose. \",\"author\":[,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news uk-coronavirus-pandemic-live-advice-\",,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news uk-coronavirus-pandemic-live-advice-\",,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news uk-coronavirus-pandemic-live-advice-\",, said that many patients suffering from Covid- need help breathing. Ventilators can be invasive, which involves a tube being put down the patient#xs throat, or non-invasive - such as breathing through a specialised mask. Mechanical ventilation tends to be recommended for coronavirus patients, Prof Hill said. - Who will lead the Government  The Prime Minister#xs official spokesman said that Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab would take overMr Johnson was unable to work due to illness.

Maggie Ilsley issued a warning to others in a scathing post online - adding that the ordeal had left her sickened beyond words.  She said her mother Margaret Emerson, , had been contacted by her doctor out of the blue last week and taken through a questionnaire. It wasnapost until the end she realised she had just agreed to waive emergency treatmentshe contracted Covid- and die at home instead. Mrs Emerson already suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseso has been classed as vulnerable and is self-isolating. Daughter Maggie claims that the decision was framed for her mother as a choice between dying alone in hospital or at home. She added that it was also unclear whether Mrs Emerson had signed her le away regardless - askingan ambulance would arrive for a non-coronavirus incident. The call was placed by her motheraposs doctor at a surgery in Yate, Gloucestershire. She said: She had no warning about the call, and no idea what it was really about until it began to dawn on her from the questions the doctor was asking her. It was about what kind of care would she receive, and she signed that sheaposs not going to have an ambulance called out. It was framed for her as a choice between dying alone in hospital, or dying at home with her family there. Maggie first raised the issue on Facebook in a y post. She wrote: My mumhad a phone call late today when she was on her own from her GP. Sheaposs too upset to talk about it at the moment BUT has unwittingly with no time to think answered a whole realm of questions resulting in her medical records being updated to state that were she to get Covid  she will NOT go to hospital and will NOT be receiving any treatment !!!! The GP even confirmed that her responses were being entered onto the system and that the hospitals and ambulances would have access to them and know not to attend to her. How on earth   Iaposm sickened beyond words. Why are our GPs phoning our elderly vulnerable loved ones unannounced with absolutely no forewarning, no time to think, no time to talk things through with loved ones, no breathing space to make sure they understand the implications of what theyaposre being asked..with a list of questions aimed at them going on record there  then to refuse treatment and even an ambulance in the event they get Covid    How can that be morally right and allowed to happen ! What has our society come to   How can they phone vulnerable people out the blue and asktheyaposd rather die at home than alone in hospital   Wtaf ! Are they trying to guilt trip or trick our extremely vulnerable loved ones, who may have no idea and be totally alone and caught off guard, into sacricing themselves for those they deem more worthy  This is so wrong.

Dr Lucy Morgan has been working as a respiratory physician at Nepean Hospital in Kingswood, Australia, and has been screening and caring for people who have contracted Covid- for the past few months, as reported by News.au. Dr Morgan appeared on ABCaposs QA show to explain how, in the most severe cases, the virus can begin to aposshut downapos the body and lead to what was described as aposa very lonelyapos death.She wanted to give a stark account of what some coronavirus patients experienced to show that the implications of the illness are aposvery realapos. For patients whose symptoms deteriorate to the extent they require hospital treatment, Dr Morgan said: What happens is they become breathless - they canapost breathe. Every breath that they take is increasingly dficult, and so when you canapost breathe, everything gets more dficult. As the illness progresses, the patient needs more and more oxygen to help their lungs to work properly. At this point, she explains that those getting apossicker and sickerapos find their oxygen levels continue to drop and they require aposmore and moreapos support - which canapost be provided on at the ward level of hospitals. A rapidly deteriorating patient with coronavirus is then taken to an intensive care unit, where all the effort of breathing is taken by a machine.  You have a tube put into your airways and a machine breathes for you, Dr Morgan continued. Then, as this Covid- infection progress, all parts of the body start to shut down.Peopleaposs hearts donapost work properly, their blood pressure doesnapost stay up, their kidneys donapost work properly so medication and machines are used to support those processes.She says when patients have machines breathing for them and keeping the blood pressure up, they are not conscious.  Their family cannot talk to them and often canapost be with them at all. When askedit could result in a aposvery lonely deathapos, she said: Thataposs an absolutely devastating part of this illness.

I was free to talk to clubs.“I spoke to Mark McGhee at Motherwell and Gus MacPherson at St Mirren.“The chance to go to England and play for that club [Coventry] came up and it was a no-brainer really.“My agent and I sat down…we didn’t need to think about it.“There were other reasons why it was more beneficial for me – you’re trying to make a living in your career.“I had three top-flight teams up here who I had the chance to go to.“Lee Wilkie was at Dundee United at the time.

I was desperate to just get in and experience it.“But it got to the point that Michael O’Neill heard I could play with Northern Ireland [through a Coleraine-born grandparent].“He called Allan Preston [football agent] and Alan called me.“I said, ‘Can you ask Craig what the chances with Scotland would be ’ To be fair to Craig, he said, ‘I’d never say it’s a definite no buthe’s got the chance to play international football then I’d take it’.“Without saying ‘definitely no’, he definitely did say no!“I’ve still got mixed emotions about it. My dad wasn’t too sure, he didn’t want me to do it.“Other people advised me to do it and I had some great trips. I got one cap but I was in the squad seven or eight times.“Getting to train with people like Jonny Evans, Steven Davis…I loved the training and I loved the trips.“I would’ve liked to get more game time but it was causing a problem to my back and ultimately that’s why I stopped.”He made his Northern Ireland debut in a - hammering at the hands of the Netherlands on June , , just weeks after his Hibs side were beaten - by Hearts in the Scottish Cup Final.McPake – who came up against Dutch stars Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder and Robin van Persie – said: “It wasn’t like a normal friendly, it was mayhem.“The Amsterdam Arena was packed. I’m looking at it and going, ‘Wow’.“I think in that two weeks, with the Scottish Cup Final and then that game, I got beat - on aggregate.“I had a week in Dubai between that so I suppose that makes up for it.”McPake is approaching six years at Dens Park, after initially joining as a player in May , and he didn’t envisage such a long spell at the club.He said: “If I did, I’d be living in Dundee or somewhere around about there. I often say that to Dawn [we]. I love it up there.“In terms of players, Cammy [Kerr] was there – he was only a young boy.

We have often said that the club is a family and that remains true throughout this situation.In addition to our insurance coverage, we have also sought to access ious sources of support offered by the League, the Association, Government agencies and our associates.  All that have been involved have been extremely helpful in our solidication of the club as a business.  I would like to personally thank John Bennett for his very generous and selfless gesture of suspending rent on the stadium. His call, on day one of this crisis helped to set the tone for all that followed throughout this shutdown and is the epitome of showing how we are all in this together.The UK Government and its agencies have also been extremely helpful in the offering of grants loans and providing relief through the Job Retention Scheme.  That includes HMRC. It is our experience, thus far, that this country’s handling of the crisis exceeds others in the mitigation of losses for businesses as well as iniduals.  In the coming days we will be implementing elements of the job retention scheme in respect of our staff and it is our intention that all are looked after fully throughout this crisis. This includes our football players, football staff and administrative staff receiving full pay while they are on furlough for the foreseeable future.We also think it is right to give credit to the dedicated workers at the SPFL and SFA. They have been working in an ever-changing landscape throughout this unprecedented event. They have continued to keep us informed and provide us advice on how to best navigate this predicament. They have freely shared the advice and guidance they are receiving from the government and UEFA as we all feel our way through these weeks. We continue to take advice and express our opinions on what football should look like when football resumes. Although none of us know yet what will transpire with this season, it is clear that football will be back.We’ve been inundated with requests on how people can help the club.  It’s truly been heart-warming. The one way to helpyou can – and onlyyou can # is to purchase season tickets and merchandise online.  We still have limited availability of this year’s Third Strip, which may become a collector’s item as it may never be worn.This supports the club as well as SSAFA and The Black Watch Association charities.  We will soon be launching our - kit in the upcoming days and we know it’s not enough to completely fill your appetite for football, but keep an eye on the social media sites for Dundee FC and DFC in the Community, which will provide some entertainment while we all do our part to save lives by staying home.We wish we had something more definitive to say, but we hope this brief update will provide some reassurance that we are still here and will remain here when this crisis is over. So from all of us at Dundee Football Club, please stay safe, keep your families safe, that is the most important thing and know that we are all in this together and we will come through this together!"},{"url":null,"title":"george cran coronavirus scottish football dundee united dundee fc","story":"The coronavirus pandemic has hit society with a hammer blow but there is a silver lining to be gleaned from any dark cloud.Le as we knew it has completely changed.My le currently revolves around sitting in my flat coming up with stories to keep football fans entertained during these miserable times, walking my dog and avoiding my we when she tries to get me to do the odd jobs I’ve been putting off for years.I’m sure people reading this will be in a similar boat – day after day, it’s tough to keep going with good cheer.What the situation has given me is a chance to look back and think about all the good times I’ve had since moving to Dundee six years ago.Don’t worry, I’ll not bore you with all the soppy personal stuff but, on the football pitch, there have been some great moments to be witness to.Scottish football is rich with crazy stories on the field – I’m thinking of Wato Kuate totally losing the rag at Tannadice and a rampaging Sofien Moussa picking up two yellow cards in  minutes after coming on as a sub.As much as they were funny looking back, there are a few big wins I covered for both city clubs that stand out to me.Dark Blues might be surprised at my choice for the best performance I’ve seen in recent years.It was February  at Motherwell.Paul Hartley’s team were struggling after losing Greg Stewart, Kane Hemmings and Gary Harkins and that’s why it stands out so much.This was a team without creativity but, a week after beating Rangers, they smashed ’Well - and I can’t remember a better attacking performance I was witness to from a Dundee side.By half-time, a Zak Jules own goal had been added to by two from Marcus Haber and singles from Craig Wighton and Mark O’Hara.Before that game, Dundee’s top scorers in the XI were Haber and Paul McGowan on four which tells you how astonishing it was to see them rip Mark McGhee’s Motherwell to shreds.They would lose the next seven matches and Hartley his job. Looking back, that only makes the win all the more remarkable.For United, it was a far grander venue and harks back to the good old daysof regularly competing for big trophies.The  League Cup semi-final win over Aberdeen was my first experience of covering a big club game at Hampden. It was a great day with a huge Tangerine following rewarded with an amazing comeback victory thanks to Callum Morris and Nadir Ctci headers.Everyone has their own favourites and this stoppage is a great time to reminisce – hopefully, we won’t have to do that for too long.Uefa are due to meet via video conference today to thrash out some sort of plan for sorting how the current season ends.I’m glad to hear that’s because it’s pretty much certain their initial hopes to get club football completed by the end of June won’t be coming to fruition.August seems to be the consensus and it sounds fair enough.What I expect to come out of this virtual get-together is some sort of rational plan to sort out player contracts and technical issues like that.That’s what Uefa is there for. What I don’t expect them to do is grant the SPFL’s wishes by making tough decisions on how to end this season.I can’t help but think Neil Doncasterand SFA chief Ian Maxwellare desperate for Uefa to make a sweeping decision so they can avoid any sort of responsibility when people moan.My gut feeling is the European chiefs will have a plan to get the campaign finished in the autumn and roll straight into the new one. I would dearly love our set-up to be restructured to bigger leagues, however.After watching the  Scottish Cup Final on Sunday it made me think ‘where have all the cup finals gone’ It’s been five long years since Dundee United were last in a major cup final and  for Dundee. The end of my first season at the Tele saw the Tangerines in the Scottish Cup Final and then the League Cup showpiece a year later.It just shows how quickly things can fall apart – thankfully, both seem to be putting the pieces back together.To keep me amused I’ve been watching the Leeds United documentary on Amazon. I love these shows but think they are missing a trick not doing Scottish football – imagine all the bonkers stories they’d get up here!LEE WILKIE: I have sympathy for Neil Doncaster and Ian Maxwell but they need to grab the bull by the horns and show leadership\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-neil-doncaster-ian-maxwell embed # secretBXEngLa\" data-secret\"BXEngLa\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.5984089-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.5984089-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.5984089-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.5984089-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"jordan mcghee is determined the coronavirus lockdown wont knock dundee off course","story":"Dundee defender Jordan McGhee hopes they are able to pick up where they left off before the coronavirus lockdown.Scottish football has been shut down for almost three weeks now after the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic put the Dark Blues’ Championship season on hold.The Dee had been in a rich vein of form, with a six-match unbeaten run seeing them rise to third, well-positioned for a place in the Premiership promotion play-offs.The waters remain murky as to how the current campaign will find its resolution. However, former Hearts and Falkirk man McGhee hopes it’s with Dundee having success.“We want to pick up where we left off because before the shutdown we started to hit a bit of form,” the -year-old said.“We knew that what would happen it was just about getting the right balance in the team.“I think we’ve got that now so we’re just raring to go again and finish the season as strongly as possible.”McGhee insists the squad are working together remotely to stay motivated and fit for a potentialto action.“I think some people will struggle but you don’t have an option right now other than to motivate yourself,” he added.“The way the world is at the moment you’ve either got the option to sit and watch TV, lying about doing nothing or you go out and exercise yourself.“Everyone in our changing-room will be going out to stay fit. I know the boys well enough to know everyone in the team is motivated to be successful.“Running and making sure they’re ready to go when football resumes is a big part of that.“We’ve got a few WhatsApp groups – one with the coaches and one with the players.“The coaching staff keep on top of us with our fitness stuff but everything is up in the air at the moment.“No one knows what’s happening so really it’s just a guessing game at the moment for us.“The manager’s been good, though, in keeping us going. We’ve been given tasks like a weekly challenge on a Friday.“Last week it was to do a k under  minutes on top of our programmes which have been tailored and specically set out.“With regards to the manager I think he trusts us all to go away and do it ourselves butwe don’t we know we’ll be found out when we go back.“It’s dficult because, normally, you’re building up towards a weekend where you’ve got a game coming up.“We’ve not got that now so it’s dficult to stay prepared for what may or may not happen physically and mentally.“The fact you’re not with the boys as well makes training dficult. The mental aspect is hard for everyone at the minute, in all walks of le.“We just need to get on with it and see what the outcome is then take it from there.”On top of everything , McGhee is working his way back from surgery on an ongoing wrist problem he’d carried for most of the season.His progress, however, has been good as he attempts to step up his rehab in the coming weeks.“I was in Dundee two weeks ago to get my cast off but ever since then I’ve been at home in East Kilbride,# he said.“I’ve just been staying in the house apart from my training programme. I’ve been out running and I managed to get myself a set of weights – that’s all I can really do right now.“Having broken a bone in my wrist it’s been dficult. Obviously, because I can’t get in to seeGerryto do movements on it.“He’s sending me stuff out, though, now I’ve had my cast off for a bit.“I’ll crack on with that and, hopefully, by the time football comes round again it should be strengthened and ready to go.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5bfd1a4bab8fb-535x564.jpg ","title":"lee wilkie claudio caniggia dundee fc scotland","story":"Former Dundee defender Lee Wilkie has recalled Argentina superstar Claudio Caniggia’s colourful spell at Dens Park.Wilkie was a -year-old breaking into the first-team when Diego Maradona’s close friend shocked Scottish football by signing for the Dark Blues in .The centre-back – who also played for Dundee United and won  Scotland caps in a career cruelly cut short by injury – says the capture of Caniggia marked a surreal time at the club.Although he sometimes clashed with the Italian management duo of brothers Ivano and Dario Bonetti, Wilkie was in awe of Caniggia and his fellow marquee signings including Temuri Ketsbaia and Fabrizio Ravanelli.“It was very dferent,” he told the Tele#s Twa Teams, One Street podcast. “It was such a change for the players in the day-to-day normality we had at Dundee.“It was a majority of Scottish lads and then suddenly half the team are foreign.“They felt a bit weird coming into a dferent club, a dferent country but the biggest shock for them was probably the weather.“We were used to it being Baltic most days but boys like Ravanelli couldn’t cope – he had thermals on in August and everything.“We used to train at the Michelin and lots of other dferent places with Dundee struggling for training facilities.“It was any place we could find. Riverside was a shock for them on a December morning and certainly not what a guy like Caniggia was used to!“Caniggia, Ravanelli, Ketsbaia, all the top names that came into the club were brand new. They were great lads, they really were.“It was a bit surreal training against these boys. I was a bit stand-offish because I had a reputation of being a little rash and I wasn’t going to smash Caniggia in training!“He was just left to do his thing and you gave him the respect he deserves.“He basically got to do whatever he wanted around the club. Nobody was going to tell Caniggia he couldn’t do something!“We’d be at training and his five-year-old son would be up with us. We’d be doing a shooting exercise and running out of balls because Caniggia’s son had six at the side kicking them about!”Wilkie also revealed Caniggia’s free reign didn’t stop there and the Argentine was known to enjoy a pre-match cigarette in the Dens Park dressing room.He said: “We had the one cubicle in the changing-room and I used to like my pre-match toilet to just chill out and read the programme to get my mind ready for the game.“I’d always have to wait on Caniggia coming out the toilet because he’d be in there smoking a rolly-up.“He used to just come out with a wee smile on his face, shrug his shoulders and walk past you but that was just the kind of guy he was.“The Italians and the Argentines were horried the British boys would drink beer but they would smoke asit was the healthiest thing going.“They were really fit, though. Caniggia was probably the fittest guy I played with and fans could see that when he scored his first goal against Aberdeen and took his top off.“He was so strong for his age and looked after himself really well.“He was one of the biggest players in the world and it was amazing he was at Dundee.”It was a crucial time in Wilkie’s career but bust-ups with the Bonettis led to him going on loan to Plymouth Argyle, Notts County and Falkirk.But he found his way back to Dens, impressing then-Scotland manager Berti Vogts enough to get a call-up to the national team.“It was dficult for me because I was young and fiery and they were exactly the same,” Wilkie said of clashing with the Bonettis.“I had a couple of fall-outs with them that really came from nothing. It’s disappointing how it ended up because I really quite liked them.“Dario really knew his stuff as a coach and, as an ex-defender, he used to take us away to do bits and pieces in training.“I really enjoyed that. The two times I fell out with them were from silly little things in training that shouldn’t have happened.“My loan moves then came from the fall-outs but I got called back from Falkirk because they’d fallen out with Marco De Marchi and Fan Zhiyi.“When I was on loan at Notts County I’d pretty much given up. I was close to deciding I was done with football because I was fed up.“I was in a bad place. I got injured down there in my first or second game, sat stuck in a hotel and I thought that was me done.“I was only  so I was just a bit naive and immature I guess. Getting back to enjoying the game was about  per cent luck.“I was playing for Falkirk, doing OK and enjoying it in a young team in the First Division with boys like Mark Kerr and Lee Miller.“My head was still pretty much gone from the previous couple of months. But with the Bonnetis falling out with almost all the centre-halves at Dundee bar one, I was back in.“I got on well with [former Dundee owner] Peter Marr and he liked me as a player so persuaded Ivano to bring me back.“I went back and played about six games towards the end of that season and Berti showed up to watch me put in two man-of-the-match displays.“Next minute I’m called up for Scotland.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.5984089-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.5984089-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.5984089-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.5984089-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"lee wilkie dundee fc dundee united out of contract","story":"I have to say I feel for players at Dundee and United right now – especially those out of contract this summer.It’s a horrible situation for a lot of people in their jobs right now with no real knowledge of what is going to happen and footballers are no dferent.It is a job at the end of the day, a good one and one a lot of people would love to have.But, just like everyone , players have families and bills to pay. That goes for the clubs, too.That’s why I’m not surprised both the Dark Blues and the Tangerines have opted to use the government’s furlough scheme – they are businesses and they have to do what is right to ensure they stay afloat during this time when there’s no income.Like a lot of people in the city right now, that will bring a whole lot of worry to workers for what the future holds

finished rehab on my knee and wasn’t even sure I’d be able to play on anyway.Thankfully, Dundee United gave me a chance, though the uncertainty continued even so.I wasn’t sure my knee would hold up and they gave me a contract from September to June on £ per week – a far cry from the million-pound lestyle people associate with some footballers.There was an appearance fee on top but spending time on loan at Ross County meant I couldn’t get that and it was a really tough time in my career.Right now, there are worse things going on in the world with people’s health but adding the stress and worry of work problems just piles on top for a lot of people.I think the move to furlough staff for the time being is a sensible one for both city clubs.What the players are desperate for now is some sort of certainty from the powers-that-be.The UK Government has gone to town on footballers this week completely unfairly.They are an easy target right now.I understand why people think players should front up and take pay cuts to either help non-playing staff at clubs or the NHS or whatever.However, they all seem to be lumped in the same bracket when only a small percentage of professional footballers earn millions of pounds.Boys playing for clubs like Dundee or United or St Mirren, Hamilton etc are not earning fortunes and they have bills to pay like everybody .I think everyone should be doing their bit to help during the coronavirus pandemic, whether that’s through paying taxes or some sort of voluntary work, but it seems like footballers have been called out because they are an easy target.There are plenty of people across the country earning big bucks but not getting hammered.A better way to go about it would have been to say to players exactly what their club needs to save and to give an option to donate part of their salary to the NHS.It seems a weekly occurrence at the moment that we see an SPFL meeting as the time decisions will finally be made.I’m not holding my breath too much for this one tomorrow but you never know.I saw Celtic put out they want to finish the season but they are in a position where they can take the high ground.Everyone has their own agenda but what we really need, what clubs and players need, is some idea of how Scottish football will continue.Cheering on the Virtual Grand National over the weekend was about as close to sporting

rumour and speculation since the last update we had from the SFA and the SPFL.What that radio silence hammers home most to me is a lack of leadership and decisiveness.Don’t get me wrong, I have sympathy for Ian Maxwell, Neil Doncaster  Co.This is a very complicated situation where you are unlikely to please everyone because so many doors could open up in dferent directions for clubs in terms of the current season and ongoing league structure.It melts your mind a bit when you start thinking about all the possibilities and how it could affect people but there needs to be a decision made soon.Uefa won’t do it for them, nor will Fa or English football, they need to grab the bull by the horns and show a bit of leadership.The resolution for all of this starts with them so it’s important they’re clear with their message.There’s no way they could possibly keep everybody happy but they must do something decisively and quite quickly to protect clubs and their incomes.I think most football people, myself included, would like to see the season played to a finish – eventhat is behind closed-doors.However, it’s beginning to look like we won’t see that happening at all given the current health guidelines from the UK and Scottish Governments pointing towards a longer lockdown being put in place across the country.August has been touted as the date for ato domestic football and, like I have said before, although it will be a long four months, it could be a good opportunity to restructure our gamedone correctly.It’s definitely an option and, depending on how it looks, I might even prefer that to closed-doors games.Reshuffling the leagues and increasing the number of teams will be refreshing and I think most fans would back that.Most of the clubs would be fairly happy, too, with no relegations across all four isions and promotion for the top two sides in the lower leagues.There may be some disputes about the tighter leagues and promotion play-offs but you’d like to think most would understand the extraordinary nature of the situation.Dundee would probably have been able to push Inverness right to the end and might feel a bit hard done by but it’s a really dficult one.I don’t envy the high heidyins but they’re paid to make these calls.The biggest thing that needs to be cleared up as soon as possible, for me, is the financial aspect of the shutdown.Clubs have been left in limbo by the powers that be for too long already.Many don’t have any income at all while there are still so many question marks about how they will access adequate monies from the SPFL and the SFA.It’s really important they decide what’s happening as soon as they can because clubs need to move on and plan for, what looks like, months ahead without any football.There’s so much work to do, it’s a bit of a head spinner.At this stage we’re not even taking into account the transfer window where, Dundee United in particular may be able to raise cash.I’m sure there will already have been plenty of enquiries about Lawrence Shankland.It’s probably a huge worry for a club like United. Of course, all clubs have dferent worries financially because they’re all in dferent situations.The least they deserve is clarity.Even in the summer it doesn’t take long for players to be itching to get back to football.The current situation with the coronavirus shutdown is a dferent kettle of fish entirely, though, and poses heightened mental health risks.For that reason, I was delighted to hear Tony Asghar say Dundee United are using a sport psychologist to help players stay positive.Clubs are far more equipped to deal with these things than when I started  years ago.My son Jack and I have been out on our bikes to try to break the boredom of lockdown this week.He’s been doing a lot of running as part of his training programme from Dundee but somehow I think I’ll stick to the pedals!"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/5e43c7674cc1a8.50317842-795x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street dundee boss james mcpake on his life in football","story":"This week Tele sports reporters Calum Woodger and George Cran are joined by Dundee manager James McPake to talk through his career on the pitch and le since taking up the Dens Park hotseat.The coronavirus lockdown means we are working from home, over the internet, to produce Twa Teams, One Street at present.We hope to continue to bring you podcasts in this uncertain period, eventhey#re with a slightly dferent flavour.Thank you for listening and call the Twa Teams, One Street fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about anything Dundee, United or from the wider world of football.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-memories-old-shipyards-factory-floor","story":"Shops are closing.

And the study sets out a vision for an “Energy Coast” around Tullos, Balnagask and the coast road.A report into the plan reads: “Aberdeen is well placed to capitalise on this energy transition and has already seen signicant investment in the sector. In this plan we have identied our first energy transition zone, a land-use zoning and supporting policy specically aimed at supporting the delivery of low and zero-carbon technologies, placing Aberdeen at the forefront of this emerging industry.“The energy transition zone has been placed adjacent to the South Harbour extension and rail line to maximise development opportunities.”The report states the site would help meet national emissions goals, with the target of Scotland having net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by .It has been supported by a host of organisations including Opportunity North East, Oil and Gas UK, Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce and Scottish energy minister Paul Wheelhouse has also given it his backing."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/dab9e9eb-a882-4e9d-b0f7-e4f185060291-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/dab9e9eb-a882-4e9d-b0f7-e4f185060291-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/dab9e9eb-a882-4e9d-b0f7-e4f185060291-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/dab9e9eb-a882-4e9d-b0f7-e4f185060291-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"aberdeenshire council continues to tackle poverty amid coronavirus pandemic","story":"A north-east council is taking coronavirus into account as it works to tackle poverty and inequality.Aberdeenshire Council#s communities committee was updated on the work of the council#s poverty and inequalities strategic group.The meeting came amid concerns of more people entering poverty for the first time as a result of Covid- leading to job losses.It highlighted the Grampian Coronavirus Assistance Hub, which is available for those facing dficulties as a result of the pandemic.The committee also quizzed the group on the impact of additional childcare costs and the importance of ensuring all children have access to computers and the internet.Communities committee chairwoman Cllr Anne Stirling said: “We really are in unprecedented times with the challenges being faced with Coronavirus but the work being undertaken to tackle poverty and inequalities is quite exceptional.“Underpinning all of this is the partnership approach being taken by a wide range of groups and organisations, all of whom are finding ways to deliver services dferently at this dficult time.”Vice chairman Councillor Michael Roy added: “A lot of excellent work has been undertaken over the past year and we know it’s a particularly challenging time for a lot of people.“Various support mechanisms are already in place, and it’s important that we all continue to work together to ensure everybody has access to the support they need.”Poverty is defined as being where a person#s household income is less than % of the national average income, with factors such as health, housing, education, employment and access to services taken into account.Currently, the threshold is £, for a single person with children aged between five and , and £, for a couple.Aberdeenshire Council#s child poverty action plan, which was approved a year ago, aims to reduce the number of children affected in the north-east.The overall level in Aberdeenshire is % , compared to a national average of % # although the figure fluctuates between areas.A final draft of the Aberdeenshire Local Child Poverty Action Report  will go before the committee in June."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 31 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEver since it was #temporarily# closed to new admissions around two years ago, there has been the suspicion that plans were afoot to close Knapdale Ward completely.The HSCP claims to have consulted widely on the future of the ward, yet patients# relatives, front-line nurses and medical professionals say they were never asked for their views.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"a83 slip recovery work ongoing","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEssential work to make safe the area of hillside that slipped and blocked the A earlier this yearis forging ahead.Taking care to maintain social distancing and to observe all current NHS and government health advice, a team of experts has been carrying out extensive operations to stabilise the slope and construct a back-up catch-pit.Led by Forestry and Land Scotland, the team includes the geotechnical engineers and consultants involved in resilience works where on the Rest and Be Thankful, and partners Transport Scotland and BEAR.FLS Planning Manager, John Hair, said: #We’re channelling a lot of resources into this and are working on it seven days a week to make this area safe.#Over , tonnes of debris landed on the road back in January. It took a lot of clearing up but that loss of material from the hillside presented other problems as well. We’re currently underpinning a -metre stretch of the forest road to strengthen it and prevent any further major collapse.#The landslip channel has been stabilised but, in the event of future extreme weather events potentially affecting this part of the slope, we are constructing a catch pit that aims to prevent debris from reaching the road surface.#Traffic management will be in place for approximately a further two weeks to allow us to complete the catch pit. We will be working on stabilising the forest road for another four weeks after that but will not require any more traffic management.#Currently only one lane of the carriageway is in use.The area of hillside affected is land that FLS looks after but is well away both from those areas that have slipped in the past and from areas where previous mitigation work has been carried out.Engineering assessments indicate that the incident was the result of exceptionally heavy rain causing a section of hillside above the forest road to slump and block a drainage culvert. This resulted in water damming up, overflowing the forest road and reaching the downhill slope, carrying surface material downhill and also creating a channel for more water to travel down at a faster rate.John, added: #This event arose from a very particular set of circumstances that are unlikely to apply to other sites and situations. However, aware as we are of the increasing occurrence of prolonged spells of heavy rain, we have already reviewed and adapted our inspection process to include checks on other forest roads set in similar landscapes.#We are also developing climate change adaptation actions to make the forests and land more resilient and mitigate such risks.#"},{"url":null,"title":"ferry services cant stay afloat forever msp","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFerry operators are facing #signicant losses,# but cannot stay afloat forever without help, the country#s transport secretary has warned.Michael Matheson MSP has added his signature today to a letter from the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments warning that some routes could sink unless there is intervention.It has been sent to UK Secretary of State for Transport Grant Shapps to sound the alarm bell over the future of services in places like the Western Isles.Ferry companies have faced signicant losses since the outbreak of COVID- and the crackdown on travel, restrictions on movements and some freight.Politicians are warning that ferry companies will need to make #decisions# on #loss-making routes# in coming days as carrying on with reduced passengers and staffing numbers may not be sustainable longer term.It comes as CalMac, which offers  vessels serving  routes, has revealed its passenger numbers have dropped by  per cent since new rules on essential ferry travel were put in place.The company has carried just , passengers compared to , for the same period last year, although company MD Robbie Drummond welcomed the fact the public is paying attention to government advice not to travel.The company, he said, remained committed to running #leline services# to the islands.Some of the asks of the UK government include an #immediate and temporary# relaxation of the competition regulations and a confirmation that seafaring companies will qualy for the employee support scheme.Mr Matheson said: #My officials and I have kept in touch with ports and ferry operators over the past few weeks and they have expressed substantial concerns with their operations over this dficult period.#I believe that without further intervention operators will need to take dficult commercial decisions which could be avoided, and that it will be extremely dficult to recover from that after we make it through this crisis.#Current reductions in freight traffic are also a serious issue in their own right.#There is a strong case for the UK Government to do more to support this vital sector during these unprecedented times and I look forward to their response on this important matter.#"},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

People wouldnt have to isolate unnecessarily at home for  days, because yoursquoll be able to tell very quicklypeople have cleared it or not.Currently, itrsquos only patients who have been admitted to hospital who are being routinely tested for the virus.When will the tests be available Today , Professor Sharon Peacock, director of the national infection service at Public Health Englandtold the Science and Technology Committee that . million of these tests have been purchased, and would be available in the ldquonear future.Before the tests are made available, they will first need to be validated in Oxford, to confirm that they are working as expected - this validation should reporedly happen this week.Once this has happened, they will be made available to test healthcare workers, as well as the general public.Peacock said: ldquoSeveral million tests have been purchased for use. These are brand new products.ldquoWe have to be clear they work as they claimed to do.When askedthey would be made available in days, rather than weeks or months, Peak said: ldquoYes, absolutely.How will they be distributed Online retail giant Amazon has agreed to carry out distribution of the tests, which will also be available to purchase in chemist shops as well, such as Boots.Peacock said: ldquoOnce they have been tested this week and the bulk of tests arrive, they will be distributed into the community.It was also revealed that the UK is not the only country that is ordering these tests.ldquoTests are being ordered across Europe and where and purchased in south-east Asia. This is widespread practice.

then feeling isolated.We were very conscious of not going anywhere busy, and the need to avoid close proximity for ourselves as well. It was so strange not being able to give each other a hug, as we have always done over the past  years of our friendship.I chose a walk in which I hoped we would meet nobody , and we walked two metres apart. Despite our plan not to talk about the virus, we inevitably ended up doing just that, although not all the time.The walk took us to the site of the old Byres Kirk, just beyond Ormiston. As hoped, it was deserted, and so we entered.The eeriness of current events affected my behaviour. I walked around with my friend, carefully ensuring I touched nothing. The original kirk built here in  is long gone. It replaced an even older kirk, the remains of which are hidden in private woodland next to nearby Ormiston Hall not far from this site.The first kirk at Byres was eventually demolished and replaced by a neo-gothic building in the s. But after the opening of a new church in Ormiston in the s, Byres Kirk was finally abandoned and eventually demolished in the s.But the graves remain, including war graves, and there is also a headstone erected by Isabella Burns, sister of the famous poet, to the memory of her children.It was this headstone I had come to see. Isabella was the youngest sister of Robert Burns and she lived in Ormiston and Tranent for a while. In  she was widowed, with nine children, three girls and six boys. She set up a village school to help make ends meet.Itrsquos dficult to imagine what her le must have been like, but I think the fact she was part of Robert Burnsrsquo immediate family may have given her a status and a degree of respect most women were denied.I found the stone and was intrigued by it. Two of Isabellarsquos children are mentioned one of them, Edward, died at the age of  in China.ldquoChina  I said out loud to myself, wondering what he was doing there. I saw the date of his death: November , .Then it dawned on me: the Opium Wars! He must have been a soldier. I quickly Googled it on my phone and sure enough he was serving in a regiment there.I stood for a moment, thinking about the story behind this scant piece of information. The Opium Wars are not usually a prominent part of our history curriculum, although they should be. The British state went to war with China to safeguard the ability of British traders to sell opium to the Chinese, which resulted in  million addicts there. Itrsquos a dark part of our imperial history, and the fact that a nephew of Robert Burns ended up dead in China defending state-sponsored drug smuggling by Britain seemed horribly ironic and sad. But it also gave me a sense of the connectedness we all have. The decisions people make, especially those in power, affect the lives of others in ways we will never know or predict.The memorial headstone also had a later inscription which recorded the death of Isabella herself. She lived until she was  and died in . She isnrsquot buried in this graveyard, however, as she spent the last years of her le in Ayrshire and was laid to rest in Alloway Kirkyard.Such a web of le and connection, now mostly long forgotten, revealed by this one memorial stone.As I left, I noticed the trees: oak, sycamore, beech and yew. They seemed to grow out of lost human memory, asthey were now s of forgotten stories.On ourjourney to the car, we passed another memorial stone, this time to the Polish soldiers who had been based in Ormiston Hall in the s during the war. This too is now a time of memory fading, but not forgotten, as the flowers someone left revealed.We had succeeded in a walk seeing almost nobody, except a passing cyclist at the end. Next time we go on such a walk, spring will have arrived undisturbed by human footprints. Keeping people safe must be the priority.Although it was an unusually sombre walk, we found time to laugh and see the funny side of things too.

You should not be driving to a location away from home to carry this out.With the police now being granted powers to arrest those who ignore lockdown rules, driving to a separate location to walk your dog or do some exercise is inadvisable.Are parks closed In the list released by the government, it stated: ldquoParks will remain open only for iniduals and households to exercise once a day.ldquoCommunal spaces within parks such as playgrounds and football pitches will be closed.The National Trust also announced that they are closing all of their gardens and parks as well due to the spread of coronavirus.Their statement said: ldquoWe have now closed all of our gated gardens and parks as well as our houses, cafes and shops to help restrict the spread of the coronavirus, and by the end of Tuesday  March, we will close all our car parks.ldquoWe believe it is important that people do not travel, and instead stay at home and observe social distancing measures.What is essential travel You should be aware of what the government defines as ldquoessential travel.After releasing the guidelines on social distancing, the government also said that people should avoid travelling unless itrsquos essential.The statement reads: ldquoEssential travel does not include visits to second homes, camp sites, caravan parks or similar, whether for isolation purposes or holidays.ldquoPeople should remain in their primary residence. Not taking these steps puts additional pressure on communities and services that are already at risk.Coronavirus: the facts by the World Health Organisation and the NHSCOVID- is a respiratory illness that can affect lungs and airways. It is caused by a virus called coronavirus.The outbreak started in Wuhan in China in December  and it is thought that the virus, like others of its kind, has come from animals.As this is such a new illness, experts still arenrsquot sure how it is spread. But, similar viruses are spread in cough droplets. Therefore, covering your nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing, and disposing of used tissues straight away is advised. Viruses like coronavirus cannot live outside the body for very long.The NHS states that the symptoms are: a dry cough, high temperature and shortness of breath - but these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness. Look out for flu-like symptoms, such as aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose and a sore throat. Itrsquos important to remember that some people may become infected but wonrsquot develop any symptoms or feel unwell.Washing your hands with soap and water thoroughly. The NHS also advises to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleevewhen you cough or sneeze put used tissues in the bin immediately and try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell. Also avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth unless your hands are clean.As of Monday,March , the prime minister has put the UK into lockdown and instructed all citizens to stay at home. People can only leave their homes to exercise once a day, go shopping for food and medication, travel for medical needs or to care for a vulnerable person, and travel to work onlyessential. Police will be able to enforce these restrictions.All non-essential shops will close with immediate effect, as will playgrounds, places of worship and libraries. Large events or gatherings of more than two people cannot go ahead, including weddings and celebrations. Funerals can only be attended by immediate family.Children of separated parents can go between both parents homes.Anyone with a cough or cold symptoms needs to self-isolate with their entire household for  days.The government has now instructed bars, restaurants, theatres and non-essential businesses to close and will review on a lsquomonth to monthrsquo basis. Schools closed from Friday,March ,for the foreseeable future, and exams have been cancelled.The over s or anyone who is vulnerable or living with an underlying illness are being asked to be extra careful and stay at home to self-isolate. People with serious underlying health conditions will be contacted and strongly advised to undertake \"shielding\" for  weeks.For more information on government advice,check their website.You should now avoid public places and any non-essential travel. Travel abroad is also being advised against for the next  days at least, and many European countries have closed their borders.Donrsquot go to your GP but instead look online at the coronavirus service that can tell youyou need medical help and what to do next.Only call you cannot get help online.Only call NHS you canrsquot get help online and feel very unwell. This should be usedyou feel extremely ill with coronavirus symptoms.

support developers are already seeing applications for public meetings lodged without a date or venue for exhibiting future proposals.And Tony Thomas, director of APT Planning  Development in East Linton, says ensuring the building industry is ready to resume as soon as possible may mean future consultations have to be carried out on websites.Mr Thomas revealed that one consultation had already begun online as Queensberry Properties launched a website inviting feedback on its proposals for Finance House in Edinburgh.The website was launched after a planned second public consultation this month had to be cancelled and gives people a chance to view the plans to turn the former office building into residential accommodation with associated commercial and leisure facilities.And it could be the way people are consulted in the future as more companies look at ways to engage with the public without face-to-face gatherings.The first public stage of planning applications for large developments is lodging a pre-application noticewith a council informing them that public consultation meetings are being held.The meetings, which usually take place in town halls or community centres, give local residents a chance to see the proposals for the first time, talk to developers and give their views.However, that crucial stage is on hold for some developments after the lockdown, which prohibits gatherings of more than two people.At Millerhill, Midlothian, a pre-application notice for housing at Wellington Farm on land known as Dukersquos Field has been lodged with no date or venue for the public exhibition.In a note to the council, the developers have said: ldquoIn light of Governmentadvice which seeks to minimise the spread of coronavirus, non-essential contact is limited at his time.ldquoWe are therefore awaiting the advice of the Scottish Government before making any formal arrangements for pre-application public engagement.Mr Thomas said it was vital for the industry that companies were ready to resume work as soon as possible.He said: ldquoThe approach to all aspects of the planning process is very much an emerging issue.ldquoThe authorities are working hard to continue lsquoas normalrsquo whilst working remotely and this is hugely appreciated.ldquoIt will be important that as and when restrictions are lted the development industry is ready to respond quickly.ldquoFrom a workload perspective, most clients are looking to progress with projects that are already in the pipeline and to be fair the alternative would be catastrophic for a sector that feels peaks and troughs very quickly.ldquoWhere public consultation is still proposed programmed, the only way to achieve this will be to set up a dedicated website with the ability to post

Almost nobody has been untouched by it, although for some it has been more cataclysmic than others. But we are in this together, and it will be together that we pull through it.One of the real heartbreaking consequences of the lockdown has been the separation of families. Many grandparents now cannot see their grandchildren, or even their own children. Family of people who are ill cannot visit their loved ones. Each story has its own set of circumstances and sadly more is to come before it gets better.While we do need light-heartedness at this time, itrsquos also really important to acknowledge peoplersquos struggles. It was with gut-wrenching despair I realised a number of weeks ago that the arrival of Covid- in Europe was going to seriously affect so many families, my own included.I have five children, but my middle child, who is now  years old, has for the last eight years shared time between Scotland and Sweden.She went to school here until she was seven, when she began to attend school in Sweden. It was then that I had to adjust to the painful reality of less time with her, although I was still able to maintain regular time with her in Scotland and of course keep in daily touch.Itrsquos been an emotional rollercoaster, in which I have stories of me sleeping at airports, travelling through Scandinavian landscape at ungodly hours, and along the way meeting people who have helped and made a real dference. But itrsquos been worth it as it meant our blended family remained connected and my daughter hasnrsquot felt ided between two families but rather a full part of both.We were due to travel to Sweden this Friday andlater, but of course the flights were cancelled a couple of weeks ago. Explaining this to my daughter, and then not being able to say when we would be together was heartbreaking. I felt so helpless, unable to comfort her. Wersquod all counted down the days and now it seems it may be weeks, even months, before any reunion will be possible.I know that there will be families in similar or worse situations. My heart goes out to them all. My initial response to my situation was to close down with despair. The idea of not being with my child, for whom I was the equal main carer until recently, feels unbearable. Some friends have said, with good intentions: ldquoAt least shersquos safe.Yes she is, and I give thanks for that. But any loving parent facing long-term enforced separation from their child will understand the grief that such separation creates. It seeps into your being and makes it dficult to get through the day without having really dark moments. I tried to hide my emotions, but my loving and understanding we knows me too well yet she too felt helpless.There are moments in our lives when we are just overwhelmed by the impossibility of a situation and we just want to curl up and close down. I recently reached that point.Then my daughter asked me while we were talking online: ldquoI wish we could get a magic flying carpet or something dad, or ask the faeries to make a portal. She understood this wasnrsquot possible, but it was the wake-up call I needed. It made me realise I needed to get out of the pit of despair and, for her sake as well as mine, use my creativity to make that magic carpet, and that portal, to help us stay closely connected during this awful time.And the magic ingredient is stories. My daughter has always loved stories, and we have made many up together some of them have even been printed on this page. Now these stories help keep us connected and ease the pain of separation for us both.And so, with the help of technology, and, crucially, a good relationship with her mother, stories have begun to create a vital space for my daughter to be with her Scottish family, even when separated. We can all be together, even my grown-up daughters, who I miss even though they are isolating close by.We storytell to each other, make stories up and even share them in short films. Wee sister Skye, who is six and misses her sister like crazy, holds the tablet which she uses to speak to her, so they can be together while I tell stories and share riddles. We draw and add to the stories together, make fun dramas in which we film ourselves on phones acting out stories like Cinderella, and I have learnt to put wee films together which we can then watch together.Sharing stories like this has given extra meaning to our online communication. It takes us away from just asking ldquohow was your day  or ldquowhat did you do today  questions that often just seem to emphasise our current disconnection. Later, after this crisis is over, the wee films, the artwork and written stories will be memorabilia of this time our evidence that we remained close, even when forced apart.I write about this because I know there are parents and children out there in similarly dficult situations to say you are not alone in this and letrsquos be kind to each other and share the ways we keep ourselves connected. I also know others will have discovered better solutions, as Irsquom no technical wizard.Children are resilient, often more than their grown-ups are, but we need to help them manage this time emotionally, and when we canrsquot give them a hug or be physically with them in hard times, an inheritance of stories they can access can be a real support.I have often been less than enthusiastic about social media in the past, but right now people are discovering in this crisis it has become a leline in many ways.If you, or someone you know, are in a similar situation, please do get in touch.

When we first trawled the area in search of a home, the number of towers and turrets dotted among the hills or peeking from treetops was immediately apparent. They werenrsquot clustered, as in San Gimignano, but inch for inch they matched those on Tuscanyrsquos peaks.Itrsquos a reminder, were it needed, that murderous feuds were once a universal problem, not something dreamt up by Mediterranean dynasties or Scottish thugs. But the Borders saw more than its fair share of violence, and few parts of the country were as heavily fortied in the Middle Ages. While many of these strongholds now lie in ruins, their presence injects an undercurrent of menace to an otherwise idyllic scene.These past few days I have been thirled to my desk, writing about Mary Queen of Scots, who was frequently in these parts. Sometimes she was going about royal business ndash presiding over law courts in Jedburgh for instance ndash but often she was socialising, as when she was one of a hunting party at Traquair. Whatever their purpose, few of her visits passed without drama of some sort. On one particularly memorable occasion she was seeking refuge.

Keeping people at a distance was sometimes essential to save your skin. No government edict was required to make these escapees haul up the portcullis or bar the gate. In fact, especially around here, it could be the governors of the day from whom they were retreating.When pestilence swept through communities, those who could afford to flee towns and cities for the countryside did so, for as many weeks as it took. No doubt the fortied dwellings around here came in useful in those circumstances, but itrsquos not what they were built for.

A friend who lives in a th-century house in Italy always unlatches the kitchen window, on the first floor, and calls out ldquoFriend or foe  when we arrive. There are no windows at ground level.Borders keeps donrsquot have the space or allure of castles ndash I canrsquot see a series called Escape to the Peel Tower ndash but they are brilliantly designed for splendid isolation. Admittedly those with mobility problems or serious underlying health issues might have trouble reaching the bathroom under the rafters. Nor are they for the very tall, who risk concussionthey sit up suddenly in bed.Generally therersquos one room on each level, and the stairs from cellar to rooftop are a vigorous workout. Just bringing lunch from kitchen to dining table burns calories. The turnpike stair between floors is wide enough for one person only, presumably so you could single-handedly fight off anyone who got inside, skewering them inidually as they appeared. The walls are thick enough to withstand fires intended to smoke you out, the windows too small for any but a sniperrsquos aim, and the parapets heaven-sent for tipping boiling water or tar on to those below. Cannon balls could do fearful damage and eventually bring the household out waving white flags, but that would take time. The most pressing worry for anyone besieged in a keep was lack of ale and hunger. In that respect things arenrsquot so dferent for us.Fleeing from her rebellious lords in June,  Mary Stuart escaped to Borthwick Castle with her disreputable Borderer husband the Earl of Bothwell. Shortly after, the army of those who wanted to depose her set up camp outside. Bothwell managed to nip out the back door, leaving the queen to rail at her besiegers from the battlements. Apparently her language was so foul the ambassador who reported the scene quickly redacted it.Borthwick is built to withstand siege for months on end, but one night Mary was lowered out of a window on to a horse, and rode through the dark to Dunbar. The castle there was all but impregnable. Arguably the biggest mistake she ever made, some days later, was to leave this safe haven. Anyone searching for parallels between those days and ours need look no further."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-orange-order-plan-glasgow-parade-thank-tory-government","story":"Jim McHarg, Grand Master of the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland, said Boris Johnsonrsquos government had stepped up to provide a ldquopackage of support unlike anything we have ever seen before.In a statement posted online, Mr McHarg called for a parade in the city in September as a way of thanking frontline NHS workers and politicians for their efforts during the disease outbreak.:Care home staff prevented from accessing masks as residents died in outbreakIt came as the Order confirmed the annual July  march commemorating the Battle of the Boyne had been cancelled in both Northern Ireland and Scotland.Mr McFarg said: ldquoAs a Union of nations, the Chancellor has ensured that the support measures he has introduced is there to support all parts of the UK.

We have to, in our exit strategy, balance all of these dferent elements, which can be in tension,\" he added.At the daily No  briefing, Professor Dame Angela McLean, Chief Scientic Adviser to the Ministry of Defence, suggested social distancing was having an effect on slowing the virus and noted how the growth in admissions was ldquonot as bad as it could have been had the lockdown not been put in place.\"It is working but the big question is: is the virus spread slowing down enough to make hospital admissions stabilise and then even fall \"Dame Angela said the hospital admissions data by region had risen \"very steadily\" until April  and then showed a \"more complicated behaviour, starting we hope to slow down\".She added: \"But it really is too soon to see the effects of the big changes weve all made to our lives from March  onwards because thats only two weeks ago and it takes several weeks after youve become infected for you to realise youre ill enough that you really need to be in hospital.\"Were all watching these numbers very, very carefully and were very much hoping whats going to happen next is they will at least stop rising.\"Meanwhile, in an open letter addressed to the G, the group of former leaders, who included British prime ministers Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and John Major, called for the speeding up of the search for a vaccine, cure and treatments as well as reviving the global economy.They urge global collaboration and commitment to funding ldquofar beyond the current capacity of our existing international institutions.Their statement says: ldquoThe economic emergency will not be resolved until the health emergency is addressed the health emergency will not end simply by conquering the disease in one country alone but by ensuring recovery from Covid- in all countries.The ex-leadersrsquo plea is for agreement within days for:  billion to rapidly hasten the global effort for vaccines, cure and treatment bn to support health systems, from ventilators to test kits and protective equipment for health workers and bn for developing countries to fight the medical and economic crisis, prevent a second wave of the disease flowing back into countries as they come out of the first wave.This would mean waiving debt interest payments for the poorest countries, includIng bn due this year from Africa.

Worth holding onto, everyone agrees.:In Calderwood scandal Sturgeon had to prioritise public health over personal excusesI said as much on Twitter, during the  hours between the breaking of the Sun on Sunday story and the resignation of Dr Calderwood as Chief Medical Officer, and again yesterday morning on BBC Radio Scotlandrsquos Good Morning Scotland programme.Admittedly, however, I have had a fair amount of flak from a lot of people whom I both like and respect, and who profoundly dispute my analysis and feel that the First Minister badly mishandled the matter.Furthermore, to be fair, opinions on Nicola Sturgeonrsquos handling of Dr Calderwoodrsquos indiscretion are not entirely aligned to whether the holder of the opinion ticked a Yes box or the No box six years ago, as is depressingly common. On the contrary, I have spoken to, and seen comments from, many nationalists and SNP supporters who agree with unionists that Ms Sturgeon bungled Sunday in its entirety. That matters.They see Dr Calderwoodrsquos actions as having been indefensible, a case of one rule for her and another rule for the little people, and clearly deserving of an immediate sacking. They see Ms Sturgeonrsquos failure to do so as a failure of her leadership, even a case of her keeping a crony in post in defiance of all known political and PR gravity.I understand this viewpoint, and the genuine anger Dr Calderwoodrsquos actions provoked amongst the general public. And, even as someone who despairs at the political culture of calling for resignations, I think that the opposition leadersrsquo call for her to be removed was not unreasonable. In any normal time, theyrsquod be right, and this would be an open-and-shut case.However, I think the knee-jerk ldquoSturgeon screwed up analysis is missing two critical factors. The first is an understanding of how politics and PR work during the fastest-moving news environment we have ever seen. The conventional political and PR gravity to which I referred are not present during coronavirus. There are no rules. Thatrsquos why a government can lock us in our homes and still poll at over %. Thatrsquos why a government can shut down an economy and retain the confidence of most people that it is doing a good job. Thatrsquos why a government can tell people not to see their nearest and dearest and be listened to. There really are no rules.By observing the conventional rules of politics and PR, and immediately sacking Dr Calderwood, Ms Sturgeon would have taken every other option off the table. Instead, the CMOrsquos inclusion in the lunchtime press conference was not so much a vote of confidence as it was a buying of some time to see how the story developed, and to ascertain whether the CMO could be saved.This may not have made for a pleasant few hours on social media, but I would contend that it was a good few hours of leadership .\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Scotlands chief medical officer resigns for not adhering to social distancing advice\",\"description\": \"Scotlands chief medical officer resigns for not adhering to social distancing advice\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media efihlhu poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests efihlhu.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Ms Sturgeon has plenty of political capital, and her team will rightly have judged that her personal handling of this is likely to be a -hour lsquobubble storyrsquo. We are enduring, or enjoyingyou prefer, an unprecedented volume and scale of news.Criticism of Ms Sturgeonrsquos management of the matter has PR competition with the Queen making an extremely rare address to the country, the UK Government Health Secretary suggesting that outdoor exercise might be banned, the election of a new leader of the Opposition, and the Prime Minister being admitted to hospital with the virus.In other words, she could afford to take a hitthere was even a scintilla of a chance of keeping Dr Calderwood in post. Because good people are worth holding on to.This first factor is connected to the second factor, that whilst Nicola Sturgeon the politician will have seen the attractiveness of a decisive sacking, Nicola Sturgeon the First Minister will have wanted to hold on to her coronavirus CMO by any means necessary.Dr Calderwood is very well respected amongst the medical profession. In a former le I was employed in that world, and I know from those to whom I have spoken that they consider her medical leadership to have been invaluable in preparing for the looming peak in cases. They genuinely worry about doing this without her, and they question whether her shoes can be adequately filled.And I suspect that, just as Professor Chris Whitty has become a crutch for Boris Johnson, Dr Calderwood will have become one for Ms Sturgeon. She is in the middle of a once-in-a-century crisis and sitting next to her at all times is someone who understands how to manage it. Irsquod argue that, far from being a failure of leadership not to sack her, it would have been a failure of leadership not to do everything possible to keep her.This has been a sorry episode for everyone. It is a problem for everyone reading this column, because it is at least a distraction from the fight against coronavirus, and at worst a setback against it.But it is perhaps also a lesson. A select group of doctors and scientists across the UK have effectively been co-opted by governments. They are now, to every degree, under the same scrutiny as politicians.What we have seen exposed, in a brutal  hours, is that the ldquodo as I say, not as I do approach which often characterises the medical profession can work in a clinical setting, but leads to disaster in a political one.Andy Maciver is Director of Message MattersShops across Scotland are closing.

His experience of winning in Scotland and his understanding of the constitution will be vital for our partyrsquos future, with Holyrood elections just over one year away.ldquoI look forward to uniting our party and working with Ian, Richard and Jackie so that Labour stands up for the interests of the Scottish people, their public services, their well-being and their prosperity.Other familiar faces ed to the partyrsquos top team, including former leader Ed Milliband, who will take up the role of shadow business, energy and industrial secretary, and David Lammy who is covering the justice brief.Sir Keir , who won the leadership contest on Saturday, said the line-up showed the ldquobreadth, depth and talents of the party and presented it as a ldquogender balanced cabinet.There are  women and  men, including seven members from black and minority ethnic backgrounds .It was announced on Sunday that rival leadership contenders Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy would be given leading roles also, as shadow education secretary and shadow foreign secretary respectively.Anneliese Dodds, who won her seat during the  general election was given the Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer position - becoming the first woman ever to hold the role.The MP for Oxford East said it was ldquoa surprise when she received the phone call from the new leader of Opposition and was ldquodelighted to accept her promotion.She said it was a ldquostrange kind of celebration for her and her supporters due to the current coronavirus crisis.Former leader Ed Milliband, who also served as climate and energy secretary under Gordon Brown, wrote on Twitter that he was ldquolooking forward to servinghellip alongside such a talented team.He said everyone must ldquofocus on playing our part to tackle the virus outbreak, adding: ldquoWe cannot go back to business as usual after this crisis.Angela Rayner, who was elected as the deputy leader at the weekend,w as named chair of the Labour party while Emily Thornberry, who ran against Sir Keir in the leadership race, is the new shadow international trade secretary.Last night Ms Rayner paid tribute to departing colleagues, saying: ldquoThank you to all those who have left the front bench for your hard work, which will no doubt continue on the backbenches and in select committees.

The party itself has made great noises about the fact that more than halfof the roles in the new shadow cabinet are taken up by women, while  are held by men, and seven members are from a BAME background.Inviting Ed Miliband back into the fold is also a brave, but clever move.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/670/-1/true/GN4_DAT_3062254.jpg--.jpg?1586164184000 alt=Thumbs up for our key worker stars says Council  width=670 /\n","title":"advice for consumers as major retailer appoints administrators","story":" The news that Debenhams have announced plans to enter administration may have left many of their customers in the Ballymena area who have gt vouchers wondering what their rights are.Debenhams, which has a Ballymena outlet, announced that it will file for administration for the second time in a year.John French, Chief Executive of The Consumer Council said: “At the moment Debenhams is still accepting gt vouchers online but this may change.

And this year, pregnant women also have to worry about Covid-, a virus that can affect a person’s lungs and airways.Last week, the UK government announced that pregnant women were at an increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus.However, the advice to pregnant women was described by Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty as “a precautionary measure” because “we are early in our understanding of this virus and we want to be sure.”So how does the coronavirus crisis affect youyou are pregnant or have just had a baby This advice was compiled with the help of Dr David Glenn FRCOG, a Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at Kingsbridge Private Hospital and Clinical Director for Women and Child Health at Ulster Hospital.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr David Glenn FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr David GlennWhy are pregnant women in the high-risk category Pregnant women do not appear more likely to contract the infection than the general population. Pregnancy itself alters the body’s immune system and response to viral infections in general, which can occasionally be related to more severe symptoms and this will be the same for Covid-.Can a pregnant woman pass coronavirus on to her baby Transmission from mother to baby during the pregnancy or delivery is probable, although the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs, placenta swabs, genital fluid and breastmilk samples from Covid- infected mothers have so far tested negative for the virus. However, a new report describes a case in which the baby born to a Covid- positive mother was found to have antibodies in their blood at birth. This is thought to represent a baby’s response to infection within the womb.Is there a greater chance of miscarriageyou test positive for Covid- There is currently no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or early pregnancy loss in relation to Covid-.Moreover, there is no evidence that the virus damages the baby. Despite recent evidence that the virus can be passed from mother to baby, the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined.What symptoms should pregnant women be aware of, and what should they dothey are experiencing any of them If you are infected with Covid- you are still most likely to have no symptoms or a mild illness from which you will make a full recovery. Most women will experience only mild or moderate cold flu like symptoms. Cough, fever, shortness of breath, lack of smell taste and even gastrointestinal symptoms are other relevant presentations.For women who have had symptoms, antenatal appointments can be deferred until  days after the start of symptoms, unless symptomspersevere.For women who are self-isolating because someone in their household has possible symptoms of Covid-, appointments should be deferred for  days.If women develop more severe symptoms or her recovery is delayed, this may be a sign that they are developing a more signicant chest infection that requires enhanced care. In this situation you should contact your maternity care team.Are all antenatal appointments going ahead as normal in Northern Ireland If you are well at the moment and have had no complications in your previous pregnancies arrangements for your care may be altered but they are still important to attend.If you have a routine scan or visit due in the coming days, you will still need to attend but the appointment may change due to staffing requirements. Maternity care is essential to reduce complications in mothers and babies. Even in the context of coronavirus, it is important that pregnant women continue to attend their scheduled routine care when they are well.Pregnant women will be asked to keep the number of people with you to a minimum. This will include being asked to attend maternity appointments alone.There may also be a need to reduce the number of routine antenatal visits.If women have an urgent problem related to the pregnancy but not related to coronavirus, they should get in touch using the same emergency contact details they already have. They should not contact that number unless they have an urgent problem.If women have symptoms of coronavirus, they should contact their maternity service and they will arrange the right place and time for the visits. They should not attend a routine clinic.What risks are there of an expectant mother contracting Covid- on a trip to hospital for an antenatal appointment Maternity care is essential and has been developed over many years with improving success to reduce complications in mothers and babies. The risks of not attending care include harm to mother, her baby or both.Many provisions have been put in place to reduce risk to mothers. These include reducing the number of visits to the hospital to a minimum, advice to mothers on reducing the number of people travelling with mothers to the hospital, attending the appointments alone, keeping numbers reduced in waiting rooms, spacing patients in waiting areas, staff taking additional protective efforts to reduce transmission in clinics with hand washing, cleaning equipment etc.How prepared are hospitals to deal with pregnant women with the virus Very signicant changes have been occurring in hospitals over the past weeks to deal with pregnant women with Covid-. Signicant changes have been made in all areas of the hospital, from clinics to wards and including delivery suites. Practice drills are being run frequently to train staff, additional resources have been brought in to help and a huge effort has been made by all levels of non-clinical, clinical, administrative and management staff.If the mother of a baby has symptoms or tests positive for Covid-, should she isolate herself from the baby Given the current limited evidence, we advise that women and healthy infants, not otherwise requiring neonatal care, are kept together in the immediate post-partum period.A risks benefits discussion with neonatologists and families to inidualise care in babies who may be more susceptible is recommended.Can a new mother with the virus breastfeed The main risk of breastfeeding for infants is the close contact with the mother, who is likely to share infective droplets. In the light of the current evidence, it is advised that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breastmilk. Precautions should be taken to reduce spread to the baby such as, hand washing before touching the baby, avoiding coughing or sneezing on the baby while feeding, and considering wearing a face mask,available, while feeding or caring for the baby.Can a pregnant person be accompanied by a partner or have visitors A person in labour can be accompanied by one birthing partner, according to the new guidelines. No visitors are permitted in ante-natal or post-natal ward areas.Will babies continue to be delivered in all Northern Ireland hospitals No, not at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine. Antenatal services will continue but it is not possible to deliver babies in the hospital during this surge period.This is due to a lack skilled paediatricians available to provide emergency care to a baby born in distress throughout the  hour period. To protect the wellbeing of mothers and babies, women booked to deliver in Causeway will be contacted and have their delivery transferred to Antrim or Altnagelvin Hospital.Should parents introduce their newborn to friends and family Current government guidance is that you should not meet with people outside your household, so no family celebrations are permitted at present.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She of course refused. She said she wanted to live, he said.The following day pressure was put on her again to sign the DNR. The doctor told her that evenshe disagreed with this, in the end it would be a doctor#s decision, said Mr Grundle.But a spokesperson for the Northern Health Trust said the current circumstances around Covid- mean that doctors have to take all appropriate action, and that the issues around #do not resuscitate# orders will always be sensitive.It has always been considered best practice to have appropriate and realistic discussions with patients and,felt necessary, their next of kin about their wishes for cardiopulmonary resuscitation,this is deemed clinically appropriate, the trust spokesperson said.This should be done in a sensitive and compassionate way and usually happens on admission to hospital.A #do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation#decision should then be documented on the appropriate trust form. The wishes of the patient are always clearly documented in the patient#s notes and will generally be respected.The trust#s policy in relation to this provides guidance for all relevant staff working within the trust regarding the process of making, recording and reviewing DNACPR decisions. We do appreciate that they are very sensitive discussions which can result in upset and even anger for patients and their families. We apologise to this lady and her family for any anxiety caused. Meanwhile, paramedics have asked the Fire Service for support in tackling the coronavirus pandemic. Ambulance chiefs are braced for a wave of cases over the next fortnight which may require the transfer of many patients to hospital. Interim chief fire officer Michael Graham said he was finalising plans, adding that ensuring adequate protective equipment was available was his main priority. We have committed to working with Northern Ireland Ambulance Service colleagues to scope out this work and by the end of this week we should be in a position to communicate what this may look like. He told his staff: I am fully aware that any such support relies on you volunteering for these roles. He also asked members planning to retire within the next six months to consider postponing their arrangements.

However, social distancing during these troubled times meant there could be no hugs or handshakes. After leaving the eggs volunteers from Tamhi, one of Northern Ireland#s biggest mental health charities, rang the doorbells and ran away in traditional #knick knock# style.

The decision has been taken in consultation with Grand Masters in England and Scotland and is in line with government health advice on self-isolation, social distancing and restriction of gatherings. Grand Master of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, Wor. Bro. Edward Stevenson said the decision was taken in the best interests of members, their families and the wider community.

They will have lost loved ones. “The Orange Family has already lost members to this terrible virus whilst others are currently in hospital.

Parades had been due to take place at  locations across the province, including the annual parade in Rossnowlagh, Donegal, but the Order will look at alternative ways of marking the Twelfth in . The Grand Master added: We look forward to the day that we can parade in celebration once again, however in the months ahead it is more important we work together to fight this terrible disease.

Like a B-rated sci-fi movie, our world is being ravaged by a killer virus which will affect tens of thousands, maybe millions. No-one knows. The experts disagree. Politicians do too, though that’s less of a concern. Worst, there is no certainty of a happy ending, with a superhero with special powers and a shiny suit to sort it all out. In a world where for almost all illnesses, we have effective diagnosis and treatment, and international experience and research to guide management, this Covid  lark is beyond our comprehension.We people who are accustomed to a pill for every ill must readjust to a new set of paradigms. googletag.cmd.push The prospect of arbitrary illness and possible death, without the presence of loved ones at the bedside, and for those of faith, the comfort of the sacraments, is terrying. For families, being unable to have the beautul and peculiarly Irish ritual of farewell, a wake and funeral to grieve and offer thanks, compounds the dread. We know that the young and healthy are likely to come through this, and that it is our elderly who are likely to succumb. Many of the sacrices we make are to protect the vulnerable and those who care for them. But there are no guarantees that any of us is safe. googletag.cmd.push Prince and pauper are vulnerable-tho it’s fair to assume that the prince isn’t coping from a homeless shelter or wracked with worry about how the bills will be paid. As with all human endeavour, there is goodness in abundance. People are delivering hot meals from their own resources to the isolated and vulnerable. Supermarket staff are stocking shelves, scanning tins and packets and smiling through the fear. Council staff empty bins, clean the streets and work from home to keep the wheels of this city turning. Bus drivers, mechanics, what we used to call lorry drivers but are now logistics operatives, all are at their posts, so that we can eat and stay healthy. Mammies and daddies, facing their own worries are reassuring their children that all will be well, putting them over their lessons and trying their best to keep them occupied and safe.So many people who have left work are offering their skills and experience to help in whatever way they can. Machinists skilled from years in Derry’s factories are working at home making masks to protect their neighbours. An incredible , people have volunteered to help the beleaguered NHS. A friend confided regarding her own health worries that she wasn’t concerned so much about herself, but about what might happen her mother with dementia, for whom she cares at home. This is love in action. Our postman came this morning, our usual chat done at two metres distance. We still managed to cover our usual repertoire of politics, weather, health and families, while keeping two metres part. My washing machine packed in. Well I think it’s a vital service, so I rang the man, fully expecting him to tell me to get lost. He told me he would look at it, but wanted to work alone, as his son is immunosuppressed. He came in the back door, I left the money in an envelope, and my clothesline now flutters with clean sheets. I feel especially for our young people, the unique, primal, mad impulsive joy of teenage springtime pulsing in their veins with the first sunny days. They are staying indoors, chatting online, putting in the days, making mad memes for the craic and to keep sane. My niece, doing her Leaving, and with no prospect of exams, is still doing a bit of study, and helping her daddy plant spuds.Her school days ended without the rituals of parties and goodbyes. Even our wee Fionnuala, my four year old grandchild, who lives with us and is the light of our lives in these dark days, knows that school is now at the kitchen table, because of the bad germs which and might make people sick. She washes her hands hourly - and the floor and walls - with enthusiasm and great care. Everywhere, people are doing what they must, often at great personal cost, while struggling with their own worries about work, bills and what the future will bring. They do these things cheerfully and in the best way they can. Superheroes don’t always wear fancy costumes, they are all around us. In these surreal times, we see our old certainties and values exposed as worthless. They seem to have been replaced by an older and more tried and tested value system, less about rights, and more about what is right. Let’s hope that these lessons stick when Covid  is a distant memory.

Slaughtneil, Ballinderry and Craigbane have emerged since , before going on to take provincial honours. There has been a new breed coming knocking at the door in recent years in the form of Glen, Lavey and reigning champions Magherafelt. Over the coming weeks, the County Derry Post will select a series of Derry club teams from the last decade. Up first is Michael McMullan, who delved through the ious players on the club scene to select his team of the decade, from  to .  – Antoacutein McMullan  googletag.cmd.push Began his knock-out championship career with a man of the match performance in the  quarter-final against Glenullin. McMullan was forced to successfully change his kick-out strategy when Mickey Moran introduced a more fluid central spine. Was immense in  against Kilcoo and Kilcar as Slaughtneil won a third Ulster title.  – Oisin Duffy  Despite failing to break into the Derry minor team in his final year, Duffy went on to play at senior level for the county. He was the driving force at the heart of Foreglens drive to two intermediate championship titles and their stint in senior football. At home as a marker or initiating attacks from his role at centre back. googletag.cmd.push  – Dermot McBride  McBride was one of the best man markers in the red and white of Derry during the early part of the decade. In his club colours, he carried on this level of consistency and has played anywhere in the back six – helping them to the  county final. He has defied a series of injuries to extend his playing career to this season.  – Karl McKaigue  The Emmets defender has been one of the main reasons behind Slaughtneils watertight unit. In , he held his direct opponent scoreless in all eight games on their way to the Ulster title. He is not just a maker, he is comfortable on the ball and has often been a receiver of short kick-outs to help his side build from the back.  – Brendan Rogers  Made his name as a full-back, but has excelled anytime he gets let loose on the wing. Ballinascreen tried to pull him out in a county final and he went on the rampage – building attacks. He attacked Ballinderrys Ryan Bell last season and when the Emmets were defeated by Glen, Rogers almost reeled them back in.  – Connor Nevin  Won a championship medal in this first season in  and went on to pick up another three, including an Ulster title as captain five years later. Has played everywhere from full-back to midfield. In recent years, when Ballinderry have been away from the top table, he still puts his shoulder to the wheel. A tough, yet quiet, character.  – Chrissy McKaigue  Made his debut while still in the minor grade, McKaigue spent a brief spell with Sydney Swans at the start of the decade, but ed to be spiritual leader of Slaughtneils golden era. He has played at full-back, but is more at home in the centre where he can dictate the terms of the game. Will regularly get forward to chip in with a score.  – Patsy Bradley  Was his debut as a high-fielding wing-back  years ago, but it was only a matter of time before he became Slaughtneils midfield general. Patsy may lack the height of many other midfielders but certainly made up for it with his salmon-like jump and hang time. It was inspirational and he often popped up when Slaughtneil needed him most.  – Niall Holly  Had he not picked up a nasty shoulder injury at the vital conjuncture against Scotstown, two years ago, Coleraine may well have pushed on an picked up an Ulster title. Can play at full-back but a colossus at midfield and his absence from the county team has been a huge void. Tall, mobile and tough. The perfect midfielder.  – Sean Leo McGoldrick  The number on the jersey is irrelevant for Sean Leo, giving his possession game from wing back to wing forward. He has to be every managers dream. Busy, comfortable on the ball and always takes the right option. When Lavey threatened to stage their late comeback in the  final, it was Sean Leo at the heart of their insurance point.  – Enda Muldoon  Made his senior debut as a goalkeeper in the  McGlinchey Cup. The following season, he spearheaded Ballinderrys attack on their way to his first championship. It was the start of a stellar career of arguably the best club player of his generation. A chief scorer, a target for kick-outs and can pass the ball with effortless accuracy.  – Enda Lynn  Some county players fade away in club football. Enda Lynn is not one of them. Despite being kicked from pillar to post, as Greenloughs talisman, he led the Wee Reds from intermediate football to being seconds away from a senior county final. Handles the ball more than most and is potent as an inside forward.  - Raymond Wilkinson  Crook has played in a number of roles for Ballinderry. His two goals sank Kilrea in the  final and he found the net the following year to break Banaghers resolve in the semi-final. He has played both as busy link man in the half-forward line and inside for Shamrocks. He also made a comeback to play in recent years.  – Mark Lynch  Came to prominence as a  year old, in Derrys last All-Ireland minor win. Was always destined for greatness. Played up front for Banagher and led the line to perfection and his six points almost shot them into the county final. Switched to midfield when they won the intermediate title and last season, they were touching distance from the senior decider.  – Conleith Gilligan  Was Derry minors penalty scoring goalkeeper in . Three years later he led Ballinderry to All-Ireland sevens success as the fly keeper, but came to the fore as the playmaker for their All-Ireland club win. In his later years, he reinvented himself as an inside forward, where he carried their scoring mantle until he eventually retired.

The new system will be operational from Monday next, April , to assist in dealing with increasing requests from the public regarding excess refuse that has been accumulated as a result of the current emergency situation. Karen Phillips, Director for Environment and Regeneration with Derry City and Strabane District Council, told councillors yesterday that the new service would include a dedicated helpline that would be manned, Monday to Friday from am to pm, with a team of staff to process and categorise all calls. googletag.cmd.push The calls would be fed into a central system, that in turn will co-ordinate each request for collection by district ward, with each area being served on specic allocated days of the week. It was outlined to members that only excess residual, green and garden waste would be collected, with no provision being made for bulky waste collections, which unfortunately cannot be collected during this emergency situation. Collections would be carried out by area and on specic days of the week and only directly from domestic premises that have made pre-arranged collections with Council, with no kerbside waste being permitted. It was reiterated to members that this service is an emergency response to assist in resolving the increased pressure on waste services and the public will be strongly advised that they must continue to fully utilise the existing refuse collection services that continue to operate as normal. googletag.cmd.push The council said they will continue to put a strong emphasis on the recycling message, re-enforcing the need for the public to continue to maximise the use of their blue and brown bins. It is hoped that this additional service will assist in providing support to vulnerable members of the community and those with specic issues with medical or additional residual waste, such as larger families and will prevent fly-tipping. She reassured members that refuse collection staff providing this service would be adhering to strict social distancing guidelines and health and safety measures. She said checks to identy members of the public who are self-isolating would be done by staff prior to the collection being arranged. Members were informed that messaging and advice on double bagging also be communicated to those availing of the service, adding that the council would review the service on a daily basis and had the capacity to put additional resources in place according to demand. It was also outlined to members that the new service, while being operational from next week, would take a number of days to roll out and the public would be encouraged to be patient and co-operate with council during this process.

The helpline will assist in providing advice and assistance to the public with excess waste as a result from staying at home during the current pandemic. The new helpline number –    – is operational from today and will deal solely with the increasing requests from the public regarding excess refuse. It will be manned by a dedicated team of Council staff, Monday to Friday from am to pm, who will process and categorise all calls. googletag.cmd.push The calls will then be fed into a central system that in turn will co-ordinate each request for collection by district ward, with each area being served on specic allocated days of the week. Members of the public using the helpline are advised that the new waste service is for excess residual , recycling and garden waste ONLY, with no provision being made for bulky waste collections, which unfortunately cannot be collected during this emergency situation. Collections will be carried out by area and on specic days of the week and only directly from domestic premises that have made pre-arranged collections with the Council’s waste team, with no kerbside waste being permitted. googletag.cmd.push The public are advised that this this service is an emergency response to assist in resolving the increased pressure on waste services and they are strongly advised they must continue to fully utilise the existing refuse collection services that continue to operate as normal. Conor Canning, Head of Environment with Derry City and Strabane District Council, appealed for the public’s co-operation and understanding at this time saying it will take the service a couple of days to get up and running and fully operational. He said: ““We have been getting an increased number of calls from the public who have additional waste and following the Government directive to close our household recycling centres, have nowhere to take additional waste. We appreciate that many are spending more time at home and accumulating more waste however, we would encourage people to do all they can to reduce waste by reducing, recycling and reusing where possible. “Our refuse collection services are operating as normal and we feel that most people have adequate provision through this service. For those with larger families, or specic medical needs, we understand this is a dficult time and are keen to help. We hope that this new helpline will assist us in doing that and reach out to the people in our communities who need additional help and support.” He added: ““It is important that people note that we are dealing with a pandemic emergency situation therefore this is not the time to do a major spring clean and expect the Council to come pick up large pieces of furniture, mattresses or white goods. We do not have the capacity to do this during this time and would encourage the public to refrain from this type of work or to store it within their garages or sheds until our bulky waste service is operational again.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Behind his boyish grin, he is consuming the fading remnants of county final Sunday. Its all about savouring the scene where unforgettable memories were made. Every last second. In his interview with the County Derry Post, the Rossa forward confesses to not having attended many county finals. They were a dficult watch, like running your eyes over the dream you may never have. Now its real and over the hours and days which follow, Magherafelt would deservedly celebrate like never before. The clubs senior famine was over. googletag.cmd.push Three days later, McElhone would be back in the inner sanctum of a dressing room on final day, this time as a part of Enda Quinns U management team. In the midst of Monday nights celebrations, he had one eye on Lavey. They were going to be a tough assignment, he admitted. Any team with Matthew and Callum Downey on board was going to be a serious proposition. But, theyd give it a lash. When game day arrived, conditions were dficult, but it was Magherafelt who prevailed, adding to their senior, reserve, U , U and U championships. Their U, U and minor leagues were also added, on the back of being the current U champions – before withdrawing to concentrate on preparations for an Ulster clash with Kilcoo. googletag.cmd.push “The negative was, theydidnt get their proper nights sleep the few days before a vital championship game,” states Enda Quinn, who doubles up as the clubs current Youth Officer. They were amidst the celebrations, looking on as their heroes brought home the John McLaughlin Cup. “At the same time, you cant tell them to go home, because you may never see this in your letime again,” said Quinn, who had a son on the U squad. “The positive was that it gives you the ammunition to go again, after seeing what success had done. The show of senior players at thefinal...to a man they were all there. “They were coming down onto the field and they were making heroes out of our Us for winning a championship, it was unbelievable.” Eoin McEvoy and Aaron Murray picked up the Downey cousins. Earlier in the season McEvoy would anchor Ciaran Higgins minor defence from number six. He has a huge future ahead of him. Magherafelt went into the final without the services of Luke McCann who sustained a serious concussion in their drawn semi-final with Dungiven. “He was our full-back, he is a serious player and, last year, was playing on Derry Us,” Quinn added, tipping him for this years Derry minor team. Before a ball was kicked, Magherafelts chief rivals were Bellaghy and Lavey. However, Dungiven turned out to be the secret assassin after making progress during the season. WATERSHED MOMENT “When you saw the quality in the forward line, I wasnt overly surprised at it,” Quinn admits. “The highlight of our season was the replay against Dungiven. We were six points down, a man down, we were without Luke McCann and went on to beat them by six points in extra-time. To me, that was the watershed moment.” At minor level, Magherafelt won the league and pushed eventual Ulster champions Lavey every step of the way in the championship. From that squad, Eoghan Hawe and Johnny McErlain, along with players like Aidan McCluskey and Shea McGuckin - who are still eligible for club minors in  - will stepinto senior football next season. “We had a wide with the last kick and theygot a goal with a minute or two to go and us two points up. It couldve went either way and they went on to win Ulster, so at least you know you are there or thereabouts.”  Derry U champions Above the minor grade, Quinn hailed their U crop that would add to Adrian Cushs senior plans. Some of them had won Ulster minor medals with Derry and helped bring the MacRory Cup to St Marys Magherafelt for the first time. Below, at U level, Magherafelt lost to Dungiven in the Feacuteile final, but ed to clinch the league and championship double. “That was a big achievement there,” said Quinn, who spent countless years with Magherafelt youth teams. After chatting to a handful of Dungiven Gaels, they came to an agreement. Magherafelt were unlucky in the Feacuteile and lucky in the championship. It balanced itself out. Though they had to win the championship without one of the best U players in the county, Cahir Spiers, who was dismissed in their convincing semi-final win over Bellaghy. This seasons Feacuteile has since been cancelled, but Magherafelt wouldve be front runners again after winning the U championship at the tail end of last season and sharing the U AB competition, one for clubs who can field a second team.  Magherafelt won the U ladies championship It was also a year to remember for the clubs U ladies. In , they joined the boys in bringing home All-Ireland Feacuteile. “The girls came through after a really tight ding-duster with Ballinascreen. They have put in savage work and the year before had won the All-Ireland Feacuteile as well as the boys.” LEGACY Their season had a positive impact on all ages of club activity, but it was the manner of their senior football win that will leave the greatest legacy and a winning culture. Enda Quinns thoughts rush back to the start of the story. The championship draw was made on a Thursday night and for the second year in a row, they were pulled out to face the county champions, this time it was Coleraine. “On the Friday night we lost our best player, Michael McEvoy, to a cruciate injury,” Quinn adds. “I dont care what anybody says, your championship draw is everything. When you draw Slaughtneil or Coleraine, it is a downer.” He doesnt buy into needing to beat the best in the first round, it is all about getting a favourable draw. Aside from a comfortable win over Ballinascreen, the Rossa won their other three games by a point “The Coleraine game, they were reasonably in control of it until Emmettscored the goal. The Banagher game,it had went on a another five minutes, they couldve won it.  Magherafelt reserves also won the championship “We were playing champagne football for the first  minutes and going six or seven points up, we looked like we couldve won convincingly. At that stage, I thought wed win this game and really be in a position to compete with whoever came through the other semi-final. “Until we beat a Slaughtneil, Coleraine or Ballinderry, somebody like that, in the championship we werent serious contenders. “We dominated the final and we will be a better team for that. Plus, the fact you have Michael McEvoy back, as well as Peter Quinn and Ryan Ferris coming in.” During his own playing career, Quinn played at corner back up through the ranks before getting to senior. By that point, the spine of his team had drted away. Now, breaking onto the senior team is a dferent proposition. “Our retention of players is excellent at the minute, but it is now a case of how we get them all football that we need to look at.” Every year their senior squad has grown, bit by bit. Quinn looks back to their  All-Ireland Feacuteile winning team. Fergal Duffin, Antone McElhone and Shane Heavron have graduated to senior level, while another - were on the this year’s reserve winning team. “In  a good chunk of that team won a minor championship and were beat in the final at St Pauls. We have won four out of the last six Feacuteile titles.” Quinn still ranks Slaughtneil as the bestteam in Derry and refers to them doing so without a plethora of underage A titles. Beating Coleraine last season should be the beginning of a regular Magherafelt assault on the senior championship and something like  players at the first senior meeting of the season radiates the enthusiasm. Some will drt, but most will stay. “Nearly every one of our senior team has won something at underage, be it a Feacuteile, an U or a minor championship. When you are producing player after player, it gives you a better chance. “Like a lot of clubs, we have put a huge effort into our underage structures over the years and this is now starting to pay off.” Away from the pitch, coronavirus – like in all clubs – has put a stop to all activity. “I know the word is overused, but the buzz around the club was unbelievable . We just hope when the whole thing is back up and running again, that the buzz is still there. It was a fantastic opportunity for us to really push on from there.” Magherafelt had  tickets sold for last Saturdays Champions Dinner, which had to be postponed. It was ignited as a night of celebration for the senior and reserve team. It wasnt like the average gala with tables being sold for outsiders to wine and dine a table of strangers, in a fundraising capacity. It was a Magherafelt night for their own. “This was going to be the biggest ever gathering of Magherafelt people,” Quinn said. Getting a new date is the clubs plan. Its not that easy. When the current pandemic ends, fixtures will take priority, though the club are really determined to hold theat some point during . The recent upgrade of the clubs gym shows the commitment placed in the senior team. There is a thirst for more success. For the underage talent to have their glory days at a packed Celtic Park. “We are in a good place,” Quinn begins to conclude. “ was a fairytale. At the start of the year, you wouldnt dared to dream as high as that, in my opinion. “You have to lap it up and you have to enjoy it. In  you could win nothing and you may not win a senior championship for another  years. Who knows...but youd sincerely hope not. “We are in a good place, from a footballing point of view and from a club point of view this has been a huge gelling experience. You are a town club and it is hard to have the same level of camaraderie because it is so spread and there are so many things going on, but  has done an awful lot for us as a club.” The year was capped off when the Gerry Crossan Memorial Trophy was awarded, as Derry club of the year, at the annual Derry GAA presentationin Tullyglass. Not a single soul in theroom could disagree. It was the icing on the cake. RELATED - The year that changed a club. Click here...

They were amidst the celebrations, looking on as their heroes brought home the John McLaughlin Cup. “At the same time, you cant tell them to go home, because you may never see this in your letime again,” said Quinn, who had a son on the U squad. “The positive was that it gives you the ammunition to go again, after seeing what success had done. The show of senior players at thefinal...to a man they were all there. “They were coming down onto the field and they were making heroes out of our Us for winning a championship, it was unbelievable.” Eoin McEvoy and Aaron Murray picked up the Downey cousins. Earlier in the season McEvoy would anchor Ciaran Higgins minor defence from number six. He has a huge future ahead of him. Magherafelt went into the final without the services of Luke McCann who sustained a serious concussion in their drawn semi-final with Dungiven. “He was our full-back, he is a serious player and, last year, was playing on Derry Us,” Quinn added, tipping him for this years Derry minor team. Before a ball was kicked, Magherafelts chief rivals were Bellaghy and Lavey. However, Dungiven turned out to be the secret assassin after making progress during the season. WATERSHED MOMENT “When you saw the quality in the forward line, I wasnt overly surprised at it,” Quinn admits. “The highlight of our season was the replay against Dungiven. We were six points down, a man down, we were without Luke McCann and went on to beat them by six points in extra-time. To me, that was the watershed moment.” At minor level, Magherafelt won the league and pushed eventual Ulster champions Lavey every step of the way in the championship. From that squad, Eoghan Hawe and Johnny McErlain, along with players like Aidan McCluskey and Shea McGuckin - who are still eligible for club minors in  - will stepinto senior football next season. “We had a wide with the last kick and theygot a goal with a minute or two to go and us two points up. It couldve went either way and they went on to win Ulster, so at least you know you are there or thereabouts.”  Derry U champions Above the minor grade, Quinn hailed their U crop that would add to Adrian Cushs senior plans. Some of them had won Ulster minor medals with Derry and helped bring the MacRory Cup to St Marys Magherafelt for the first time. Below, at U level, Magherafelt lost to Dungiven in the Feacuteile final, but ed to clinch the league and championship double. “That was a big achievement there,” said Quinn, who spent countless years with Magherafelt youth teams. After chatting to a handful of Dungiven Gaels, they came to an agreement. Magherafelt were unlucky in the Feacuteile and lucky in the championship. It balanced itself out. Though they had to win the championship without one of the best U players in the county, Cahir Spiers, who was dismissed in their convincing semi-final win over Bellaghy. This seasons Feacuteile has since been cancelled, but Magherafelt wouldve be front runners again after winning the U championship at the tail end of last season and sharing the U AB competition, one for clubs who can field a second team.  Magherafelt won the U ladies championship It was also a year to remember for the clubs U ladies. In , they joined the boys in bringing home All-Ireland Feacuteile. “The girls came through after a really tight ding-duster with Ballinascreen. They have put in savage work and the year before had won the All-Ireland Feacuteile as well as the boys.” LEGACY Their season had a positive impact on all ages of club activity, but it was the manner of their senior football win that will leave the greatest legacy and a winning culture. Enda Quinns thoughts rush back to the start of the story. The championship draw was made on a Thursday night and for the second year in a row, they were pulled out to face the county champions, this time it was Coleraine. “On the Friday night we lost our best player, Michael McEvoy, to a cruciate injury,” Quinn adds. “I dont care what anybody says, your championship draw is everything. When you draw Slaughtneil or Coleraine, it is a downer.” He doesnt buy into needing to beat the best in the first round, it is all about getting a favourable draw. Aside from a comfortable win over Ballinascreen, the Rossa won their other three games by a point “The Coleraine game, they were reasonably in control of it until Emmettscored the goal. The Banagher game,it had went on a another five minutes, they couldve won it.  Magherafelt reserves also won the championship “We were playing champagne football for the first  minutes and going six or seven points up, we looked like we couldve won convincingly. At that stage, I thought wed win this game and really be in a position to compete with whoever came through the other semi-final. “Until we beat a Slaughtneil, Coleraine or Ballinderry, somebody like that, in the championship we werent serious contenders. “We dominated the final and we will be a better team for that. Plus, the fact you have Michael McEvoy back, as well as Peter Quinn and Ryan Ferris coming in.” During his own playing career, Quinn played at corner back up through the ranks before getting to senior. By that point, the spine of his team had drted away. Now, breaking onto the senior team is a dferent proposition. “Our retention of players is excellent at the minute, but it is now a case of how we get them all football that we need to look at.” Every year their senior squad has grown, bit by bit. Quinn looks back to their  All-Ireland Feacuteile winning team. Fergal Duffin, Antone McElhone and Shane Heavron have graduated to senior level, while another - were on the this year’s reserve winning team. “In  a good chunk of that team won a minor championship and were beat in the final at St Pauls. We have won four out of the last six Feacuteile titles.” Quinn still ranks Slaughtneil as the bestteam in Derry and refers to them doing so without a plethora of underage A titles. Beating Coleraine last season should be the beginning of a regular Magherafelt assault on the senior championship and something like  players at the first senior meeting of the season radiates the enthusiasm. Some will drt, but most will stay. “Nearly every one of our senior team has won something at underage, be it a Feacuteile, an U or a minor championship. When you are producing player after player, it gives you a better chance. “Like a lot of clubs, we have put a huge effort into our underage structures over the years and this is now starting to pay off.” Away from the pitch, coronavirus – like in all clubs – has put a stop to all activity. “I know the word is overused, but the buzz around the club was unbelievable . We just hope when the whole thing is back up and running again, that the buzz is still there. It was a fantastic opportunity for us to really push on from there.” Magherafelt had  tickets sold for last Saturdays Champions Dinner, which had to be postponed. It was ignited as a night of celebration for the senior and reserve team. It wasnt like the average gala with tables being sold for outsiders to wine and dine a table of strangers, in a fundraising capacity. It was a Magherafelt night for their own. “This was going to be the biggest ever gathering of Magherafelt people,” Quinn said. Getting a new date is the clubs plan. Its not that easy. When the current pandemic ends, fixtures will take priority, though the club are really determined to hold theat some point during . The recent upgrade of the clubs gym shows the commitment placed in the senior team. There is a thirst for more success. For the underage talent to have their glory days at a packed Celtic Park. “We are in a good place,” Quinn begins to conclude. “ was a fairytale. At the start of the year, you wouldnt dared to dream as high as that, in my opinion. “You have to lap it up and you have to enjoy it. In  you could win nothing and you may not win a senior championship for another  years. Who knows...but youd sincerely hope not. “We are in a good place, from a footballing point of view and from a club point of view this has been a huge gelling experience. You are a town club and it is hard to have the same level of camaraderie because it is so spread and there are so many things going on, but  has done an awful lot for us as a club.” The year was capped off when the Gerry Crossan Memorial Trophy was awarded, as Derry club of the year, at the annual Derry GAA presentationin Tullyglass. Not a single soul in theroom could disagree. It was the icing on the cake. RELATED - The year that changed a club. Click here...

The health trust is also enhancing care at home packages for the vulnerable and elderly in the community.Mr Hazzard said the local community will be understandably concerned about the ldquodramatic changes to the hospital and that some may even be angry.ldquoDuring this global health emergency, we must put our faith and support in the expert health practitioners who are best placed to take these decisions, he continued.ldquoI welcome the public commitment from the South Eastern Trust that these are strictly temporary measures to meet the unprecedented challenges represented by the coronavirus pandemic and will not become a permanent reality.Mr Hazzard said that in the days ahead, many queries and issues will arise from the health trustrsquos decision, both from the public and those who work in the health and social care system.He declared: ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to engage with the health trust and other agencies to ensure there is public confidence in this radical approach.ldquoWith this in mind we have written to the Ambulance Service to ask that they urgently reassess their capacity to meet the subsequent needs of our local community on the back of this announcement.Mr Hazzard also appealed to the community to do all in its power to help and assist health and social care workers who find themselves at the frontline in the battle against COVID-.He added: ldquoThey are doing an incredible job in the most challenging of circumstances to keep us all safe. We must demonstrate real social solidarity in order to help and support them in the unprecedented crisis ahead..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 A\u0026E.jpg","title":"A%26E shut in Downe  ","story":"THE Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department has been temporarily closed as part of sweeping changes implemented by health chiefs preparing for the expected surge in coronavirus cases.The department closed on Monday morning with critical care staff and some equipment relocated to the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as part of a radical overhaul of services to cope with the global pandemic.The day procedure unit, outpatients department and minor injuries service at the Downpatrick hospital have also been closed, but the critically important GP out-of-hours service remains operational.Inpatient wards and acute mental heath and psychiatry services for the elderly remain open, as does the hospitalrsquos midwery-led unit, but no births are being allowed to take place for the time being.The South Eastern Trust said that as the organisation prepares ldquofor the biggest challenge it has ever faced it needs to reshape its hospitals and other services on a temporary basis to maximise its ability to ldquomanage the surge in demand for services due to COVID-.While local politicians have reluctantly accepted the closure of several key services at the Downe as part of a reconfiguration plan, they say public and private assurances from senior health trust officials that the changes are temporary must be honoured and all services fully restored when the crisis is over.News of the closure of the Downersquos emergency department and other services came ahead of confirmation that the Downpatrick hospital is one of  locations across the Province which has been designated as a primary care COVID- assessment centre which is expected to open before the end of the week.The new centre mdash designed to help manage the expected increase in coronavirus cases in the community mdash will allow patients who are showing symptoms of the virus to be separated from those with non COVID- conditions.Health chiefs insist that the new service is ldquoessential to ensure that vital GP services can be maintained over the coming weeks and months with minimum disruption.The new centre is not a testing facility and is only there for patients who are unwell and suspected of having the virus and require medical attention. Patients will not be able to report directly to the centre without being referred by their own GP or the Downersquos out-of-hours service.In addition, patients attending the centre will receive appropriate treatment, assessment and,necessary, onward referral to hospital.The new centre is designed to allow GPs and health and social care staff to work together in a suitable clinical environment and to plan what is best for the inidual in terms of treatment and any additional care they need.Defending the decision to close a number of services at the Downe Hospital, the South Eastern Trust says that each of its hospitals and services has a vital role to play in the fight against COVID-.ldquoWe must now make changes to some services in all of our hospitals to prepare for the additional critical care services needed and to achieve the best possible outcomes for our patients, it said in a statement.ldquoWe must deploy our staff and resources to best position us to provide the critical care which will be required for our local populations and to give our staff the essential training they need in order to equip them as much as possible for the challenge ahead.The health trust says that it needs to ensure that its staff can be as prepared as possible to help fight the impact of COVID-.The statement continued: ldquoRetraction of the most acute services from some sites, in a planned manner, is the best way to support our entire patient population and gives our staff the best chance to prepare for and manage the challenges and pressures upon us.ldquoThe Downe Hospital will play a vital role as part of the hospital network in responding to this crisis, particularly through the provision of inpatient services and through working alongside primary care to enable as many patients as possible to be cared for at home.Health chiefs say they believe it is imperative to respond now to provide the local community with the best possible outcomes and also to support staff as best it can.The health trust says it recognises the importance and value of all its sites and services within its communities.The statement adds: ldquoThe Trust would like to assure the community that changes made over the coming weeks and months are solely part of the effort to meet and manage the challenges presented by COVID-, the scale of which we have never faced before.ldquoAll service changes will continue to be reviewed and monitored, with the intention to fully restore services to normal as soon as possible. Every one of us has a role to play in the fight against coronavirus. We urge the public to help us protect themselves and others by staying at home and following all advice.Health chiefs say that with the situation rapidly changing plans must continue to be flexible and have asked for everyonersquos commitment and support ldquoduring these most dficult times..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Call on public to tidy up dog mess  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has called on dog owners across the district to clean up after their pets.Rowallane politician Kathryn Owen expressed particular concern about the issue in Saintfield, describing the area between the townrsquos health centre and pharmacy as ldquodisgustingrsquo.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, particularly to children, as the faeces includes roundworm eggs which become infectious after about three weeks and can remain so for up to two years.Just one pile of dog dirt can contain a million roundworm eggs and can lead to stomach upsets, throat infections, asthma and, in some cases, blindness in humans.Given the ongoing battle to contain the deadly coronavirus, Cllr Owen said the last thing needed is a battle against another disease.She said that with many more people at home and likely to remain so for the next few weeks, the number of dog owners taking their pets for a walk will increase.ldquoWe donrsquot have the same level of street cleansing being done at the moment as Newry, Mourne and Down Council is operating with skeleton staff, explained Cllr Owen.ldquoI am appealing to dog owners to take waste bags with them and please clean up after their pets. We are trying to fight onedisease, we donrsquot need to fight another one.Pointing to the disgusting state of the footpath which links the health centre at the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield with a pharmacy in nearby Main Street, Cllr Owen appealed to dog owners to be more considerate ldquoso everyone can enjoy thewelcome breath of fresh air with the pets.Her concern comes two weeks after another Rowallane councillor, Billy Walker, urged the local authority to press ahead with a plan to arm enforcement staff with body cameras in a bid to help address the districtrsquos dog fouling and fly-tipping issues.The move mdash along with using CCTV cameras to help identy offenders mdash is currently being examined by local authority officials.Last year, an enforcement action plan to tackle the dog dirt problem was agreed by the local authority which is also working with the Dogs Trust to promote responsible pet ownership across the district to reduce dog fouling.Cllr Walker said elected representatives have been ldquoinundated with complaints from ratepayers about the dog fouling issue and reaffirmed that he is keen for existing legislation to be strengthened to deal with offenders.He also cautioned against painting all ratepayers with the same brush as there are many who clean up after their pets.ldquoWe clearly need an action plan to deal with issues which are a blight on our district, he declared.ldquoI have consistently called for law breakers to be lsquonamed and shamedrsquo and council officials are seeking legal advice on such a move and any implication doing this would have on data protection legislation, said the Rowallane councillor.He added: ldquoEveryone has a responsibility and a duty of care to make sure they clean up after their pets. Dog dirt is not only unsightly but poses a health risk to young children in particular.ldquoIf people break the law they should be heavily fined and named and shamed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Singer.jpg","title":"Castlewellan singer becomes online sensation  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN grandfather has penned a song in praise of the selfless effort made by NHS workers during the COVID- pandemic.Terry Cowan has become a Facebook sensation during the lockdown with his performances of popular Irish songs.The traditional musician and singer wrote the song, Our Teamrsquos Thatrsquos Dressed in Blue, with one of his daughters very much in mind as shersquos a nurse.So far the ballad has racked up more than , views on social media.Terryrsquos Facebook fame began when he performed several songs on St Patrickrsquos Day ndash and itrsquos been growing ever since.The -year-old businessman says therersquos a growing demand for emigration songs from people who are apart from their sons and daughters.Terry, who runs Financial Directions and Property Directions in his home town, said his new found fame came about due to feeling bored on St Patrickrsquos Day when he was self-isolating at home with his we Patricia.ldquoThis has blown out of all proportion, to be honest, I did not understand the power of social media, said Terry.ldquoI was bored out of my brains on St Patrickrsquos Day and my we, Patricia, suggested that I record a couple of songs on Facebook and thatrsquos what I did. I chose Three Leafed Shamrock and If We Only Had Old Ireland Over Here because they mentioned shamrocks and I got , views in  hours. Irsquove got comments from America, Netherlands, Europe, Australia.ldquoNormally our St Patrickrsquos Day consists of going to mass in Castlewellan, then heading to the Lodge and entertaining the community until lunchtime where everybody comes in for a bit of craic. Then we take the grandkids around ious venues where they all play and then itrsquos back home at about pm.Terry is the father of three daughters, the eldest being Slieve Croob councillor Roisin Howell, whose son Ruaacuteiriacute is currently the youngest ever over- All-Ireland Uilleann piper.

He plans to perform songs with an emigration flavour such as Song For Ireland, My Fatherrsquos House, Boston Rose and a medley of Rambles of Spring The Old Dungarvan Oak.ldquoThe songs are touching a chord with people who are far away from family at home so Irsquom getting a lot of requests, nearly too many to do all of them. I have people who are telling me that they are in tears at forwarding on a song to their son or daughter whorsquos where, added Terry.ldquoIrsquom getting - comments a time, I feel humbled. A lot of people are thanking me for lting their spirits and taking their minds of the situation now. The reason Irsquom keeping it going is for the health and wellbeing of the people in the community. The response Irsquove got from people in Downpatrick has been amazing.ldquoSadly, Irsquom very conscious that I hope that the people who are listening to me now will still be listening to me in six monthsrsquo time.Like many other people who are in self-isolation now, Terry is thinking of better days ahead.ldquoWouldnrsquot it be great to go on to a football field and host a massive concert after this is all over to say thank you to all those NHS and key workers who are looking after us all, he said.ldquoWe donrsquot know how long this is going to last, so in the meantime Irsquom going try and continue to sing an odd old song.

All of the centres are monitored by CCTV.While all council meetings have been cancelled, it is understood that the permanent closure decision was taken after talks between council officials and the leaders of the local authorityrsquos main parties.In February, the Recorder revealed that the local authority was considering closing sites in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch on a Sunday, traditionally one of their busiest days of the week, with staff trade union representatives consulted on the issue.It is understood that a number of reasons were cited by local authority officials considering a Sunday closure, including the fact that the other civic amenity sites in Camlough, Crossmaglen, Kilkeel, Newry, Newtownhamilton Warrenpoint and Hilltown already close on Sunday.They were previously under the management of the former Newry and Mourne Council, while civic amenity sites in Down District have always been open on a Sunday.Council officials also revealed recently that they discovered that ratepayers in other parts of the district whose local amenity site is closed on a Sunday were using the sites in Down District.There are also reports of ratepayers in the Ards and North Down Council area using the Downpatrick and Ballynahinch sites on Sundays.The temporary closure of all civic amenity sites comes after it was announced recently that the district is recycling just over  per cent of its waste, passing the Northern Ireland average for the first time. The total amount of waste being recycled locally has increased by five percent.In relation to the recycling centre in Downpatrick, local council officials are working to have mains power connected to the Flying Horse Road.They were forced to hire a generator at a weekly cost to ratepayers of pound to power lights, staff accommodation and some specialised skips and containers which are capable of compacting materials.Council officials are asking ratepayers who have any queries to visit recycling@nmandd.org and they will endeavour to respond to you as quickly as they can..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar child wants people to have Faith as she offers advice  ","story":"A LITTLE Crossgar girl has become an internet sensation with her public safety plea urging people to fight the coronavirus outbreak.Four year-old Faith McGreevy was captured on video by her mother, Lisa, last week repeating the public health warning to combat COVID-.ldquoYou have to stay in the house for two weeks or maybe  weeks, says Faith in her message. ldquoAnd when you stay in your house and stop going everywhere, like SuperValu, then the bug will go away.Faith, who attends the nursery at Cedar Integrated Primary School, adds thateveryone does what they are told ldquothe bug would go away soon and then we could go everywhere again.Faith says that when she grows up she wants to be a doctor because she likes to make people well again, or maybe a cleaner because she loves helping her mum tidying the house ndash she canrsquot decide yet.Her mum says she has a ldquoterric grasp of current affairs and is never short of an answer.Describing her daughter as being ldquono mug, she said: ldquoWhen me and her dad Robbie wanted to wean her off the dummy we told her she should give it to Santa.ldquoShe agreed saying it was a great idea, but could she have the other dummy that was in the kitchen drawer.Faith seems to be coping well with not being at school over the past few weeks due to the lockdown.Lisa said: ldquoSometimes Faith would ask me why canrsquot she canrsquot play with her friends, but in general she is coping very well with the nursery closure.ldquoIt is a great opportunity to bond more with her little brother, one year-old Eoin.

Some have even been threatened with detainmentthey remain here without a visa.ldquoThe embassies understandably have never faced such demand for aid here, and yesterday [March ] were unable to advise on shelter or food water, which meant people were left with no lelines or hope.

They say anyone who needs assistance of this kind should contact other agencies.Downpatrick foodbank co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said the organisation regretted the changes it has had to make.When referrals are made, the name of the person, size of their family and address will be logged, alongside other helpful information including locations, post codes and details including the colour of their front door and what local landmarks they may be close to.Mrs Lennon said that the food parcels will be left outside the clientrsquos door and volunteers will not be entering peoplersquos homes.In addition, she confirmed that deliveries will be made every Wednesday and that as food supplies may be limited, the volunteers can only distribute what they have.Under the new guidelines, food donations can only be made at dedicated collection points at the Asda and Supervalu stores in Downpatrick at the Ballydugan retail park and Ballymote shopping centres respectively.Mrs Lennon said donations could no longer be left at Downpatrick Presbyterian Church.She said volunteers continue to be grateful for the support of many people to help needy families at what are challenging times for everyone.Two weeks ago, the foodbank launched a new drive through facility in response to the coronavirus epidemic but has had to abort this to comply with Public Health Agency advice.Volunteers will still be relying on peoplersquos generosity to help them cope with demand in what are unprecedented times and have been pleased with the publicrsquos response to help them continue helping families in need.The foodbank hopes that shoppers will continue to think about the charity when they are shopping and leave items at the dedicated collection points in local stores as they are expecting increasing demand on the service.The Fountain Foodbank contact details are  , email fountainfoodbank@gmail or visit www.downpatrickpresbyterianchurch.org.The Pantry Foodbank in Newcastle has also implemented a home delivery service to ensure the health and safety of volunteers, with all deliveries taking place on Thursday.Further information about Newcastle deliveries is available at   or via the foodbank Facebook page.

These measures do seem to be working, but they have to be maintained.“Complacency can be our biggest enemy at this minute in time. Your actions today will affect where our health service is in two weeks’ time. That’s why it’s crucial to maintain the measures that are in place.”Obeying the restrictions is the best way to thank the NHS, he said. He also told reporters there will be a beefed-up police presence over the traditional Easter holiday period, ensuring that people are travelling for “essential” reasons.Dr McBride went on to add: “We are far, far too early to even begin contemplating – as the minister said – stepping back or stepping away from these measures. Because this virus is out there and will come straight back at us.”Meanwhile today, Dr McBride explained why the death toll currently being used may not be entirely reliable.He said: “What we are reporting at the minute are hospital deaths. There will always be a lag time in terms of the official reporting of deaths, official statistics through the registration of deaths.“And it is possible there are other deaths in the community which, when we see those official statistics come through, may be attributed to Covid-.”However, he also indicated that the reported death toll from Covid- could also be over-estimated, saying their current approach is to be “ultra inclusive” when providing fatality figures.“There are many people who will die with Covid-... but not necessarily directly as a consequence,” he said.“I think that it’ll be probably many months before we’ll be able to tell the full picture.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It being clear that their behaviour surrounding Covid- has shown that they are not to be trusted to act as team players. An issue which must provoke unionists to decide how much longer they can be expected, despite the coronavirus challenge, to tolerate Sinn Fein as genuine partners in the executive. It goes a lot deeper than that for unionism. People want to see the joint unionist leaderships toughen up and assert themselves in restricting the perceived Sinn Fein dominance in the executive.David McNarry, Ex UUP and Ukip MLA, Comber\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have the facemasks and the visors but we were walking around with our normal unorms and just using the sleeveless aprons and gloves for looking after the patients when we were closer to them.”She said showering and changing facilities aren’t up and running yet but staff were doing their best to avoid cross-contamination when travelling to and from work and washing clothes at home.She said it was a “real challenge” and added: “Craigavon are doing their best at this time of crisis to get everything up and running, they’re looking after staff as well as they can.”She said hot meals were being provided and canteen staff greeted them with a smile: “They’re doing their best to look after us.”She said it was dficult to update because things are changing every day.Closing her remarks she finished with two readings from the Bible, from the Book of Proverbs, read in the form of a prayer: “I pray that you would trust in the Lord completely and not rely on your own opinions. I pray that you would rely, with all your heart, on Himto guide you.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
