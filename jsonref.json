However, in all the time that I’ve been immersed in music in its many different forms, I’ve never attempted to make my own. I had a keyboard when I was nine or 10, but that was as far as it went. The closest I came to getting into music production was when I worked at a music school and I was allowed to take a production course for free. But, sadly, I had to drop out because I had so much going on in my personal life. But the hunger is still there. I’ll often play tunes on my 21-month-old daughter’s musical toys. However, when it comes to trying my hand at music production, I struggle to know where to begin. There is an abundance of information available online, from simple beginners lessons, all the way up to advanced masterclasses for those wishing to brush up on their engineering skills. With the advancement and democratisation of music production technology over the past couple of decades, bedroom producers are commonplace and many of those who’ve become adept at making music kindly share their experiences online. Finding something relevant to meet my needs proves a tad overwhelming, however, and I get lost in a sea of waveforms, EQ tips and info on achieving a decent level of dB. So I turn to TikTok, using simple hashtag searches. The hashtag #MusicProductionBeginners brings up a host of user-generated videos that really help cut through the noise, so to speak. One of the producers I encounter is Kade, who posts TikTok videos under the handle @musicbykade. He manages to break down how music production works in perhaps the simplest way I’ve ever heard, hailing the convenience of loops – little repetitive clips of music that can be used as the foundation for myriad genres. For me, I was angling to try my hand at a bit of “doof doof” – loud electronic music centred on a bass-heavy kick drum. Kade’s video uses GarageBand, free software for Apple Mac users, but I use another free platform called Waveform. The basic premise and layout for most production software is the same, so I follow his succinctly delivered tip to download some loops, put them into Waveform and get started. He recommends a site called cymatics.fm, where there are free loops and I start downloading house music samples to finally take my first baby steps into the world of production. Another TikTok creator, Mikey C, drops a gem in his own series of production tips: “Here’s my best advice for first-time producers – your first songs are not going to be hits, so don’t spend forever on them,” he says. Nothing technical there, but it’s solid gold for anyone who has lofty ambitions and feels frustrated when they can’t match up to their favourite artist. Learning the basics is about exploration and experimentation, not relentlessly overworking your very first attempt at a track – Mikey C’s video was less than 30 seconds long, but his tip probably saved me hours and hours of fruitless tinkering. Another of his videos suggests reaching the chorus of a song within 45 seconds. “Anything later is going to be too long of a wait and you’re going to lose listeners,” he says. While I’m nowhere near making a song yet, it’s incredibly useful to have an experienced producer share a key tip that’s easily remembered. On my hashtag travels, I stop off at Sarah Maddack’s account. Maddack has more than a million followers and describes herself as “the silliest rapper you know”. Her comedic approach is immediately disarming. Not afraid to laugh at herself, she explains how to create the sound of a “crowd” screaming by recording different types of screams with your own voice, and then layering them to create a multi-scream, group effect. I have a microphone, which I usually use to record podcasts and radio shows, so I decide to put it to use in my new producer “lab” and record my own voice. Another video I find incredibly helpful is a demonstration of how to make field recordings from TikTok creator Arthur Caplan. “You’ve reached sound design TikTok,” says the text on his video. There’s no talking, just text explaining what he’s doing. So I take my dictaphone outside to get some recordings of the trains going past on the local line, birds chirping in the trees, and the trusty sounds of people running. The simplicity of the tips I discover on TikTok have helped me take the plunge into a world that I had always felt some trepidation towards. I’ve learned that music production doesn’t have to be this grand expedition, where you spend hours meticulously arranging and creating sounds. It can be as basic as recording the sound of leaves blowing in the wind, grabbing some premade loops and basslines, talking into a mic, uploading it all into your production software and simply having fun with it. Just don’t ask me to play any of the “music” I’ve made so far. "},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown is lifting could tiktok help you re learn how to socialise","story":"The reality was, as much as I longed to see my friends and my family, the thought of getting back out there was a daunting prospect. Feelings of self-doubt and a sudden lack of confidence consumed me. Like many people, I’ve been wondering how to actually socialise again. My anxiety levels have skyrocketed. Lockdown has played tricks with my ego and confidence. The question has been what to do about it. As a busy mum-of-three, I don’t exactly have bags of spare time. During lockdown I’d become intrigued by TikTok. I’d looked at some of the uplifting videos that had gone viral and grabbed the whole world’s attention. But I sensed there was more to TikTok than just dance fads. Could its wealth of videos about every subject under the sun help me regain my social skills and self-confidence? I start my exploration of motivational TikTok videos by granting myself permission for some basic “me time”. Given my hectic schedule, I’ve never really been one for so-called “me time” – but watching and listening to some everyday women with little sprinklings of genius on TikTok really made me stop and think: hold on, it is actually about me. “You can’t give to your family from an empty cup,” explains TikTok creator @ivanarichey – one of her many short and snappy pearls of wisdom. I scoffed at it at first, and thought what a cliche. But then I realised that, actually, if I go down, then pretty much the whole ship goes down too. From then on, whenever I could grab five minutes in between the school run and dinnertime, I’d have a quick browse at some other motivational accounts to give me that extra perk I needed to make it through to bedtime. “Compliment yourself, praise yourself,” says TikTok creator @spencer.barbosa, whose motivational gems and quick and quirky style tips will perk you up in an instant. Another of her quotes that I loved was: “You don’t have to be the best, just be the best version of yourself.” I don’t know what it was that made me more receptive to heeding advice in this format. It could have been the sincerity and authenticity of the TikTok creators themselves. It could have been their uplifting vibe or disarming humour. Or it could have been the snappy, no-nonsense format. But pretty soon, I was hooked. I honestly hadn’t actually realised until now just how important and effective it is to consciously lift yourself up, dust off that crown, and so on. Suddenly, the prospect of seeing my friends and socialising again after nearly 18 months didn’t seem so daunting. One of the things I used to love doing before lockdown was get a makeover in the lead-up to a glam event. Given that this has not been an option for quite some time, I wondered if I’d ever be glam again and didn’t want to shock people when they saw me in person. I realised I was a far cry from my filtered image on social media. So I started scrolling for quick makeovers for those of us with not much time to spare. And @thepatriciabright was just the tonic I needed to give me the lift to get my face back on and get back out there. Her videos were great for providing seemingly instant glam, and they were so funny, too – especially when she teamed up with her hubby for a parody clip. It’s amazing what a sprinkling of gold dust over your cheekbones can do. And makeup artist @dominiqueallison taught me some awesome mum tricks to hide those bags by putting a slick of concealer on over your foundation. She also whipped up some funky retro looks for when we are allowed to go #outout again.

She was also the first Black woman to do so since Judy Smith, a deputy press secretary for President George H W Bush – and inspiration for Olivia Pope in the TV drama Scandal – stood at the podium some 30 years ago. The briefing was widely seen as an audition by Jean-Pierre, who is currently principal deputy press secretary, for the top job of presidential spokesperson. The incumbent, Jen Psaki, who has been briefing almost daily, said recently she intends to leave the post after a year. Did Jean-Pierre pass the audition? Joe Biden will be the ultimate judge of that but it would fair to say that she observed the first rule for press secretaries: do no harm. Her replies were noncommittal, uncontroversial and not likely to generate unwanted headlines.  Speaking at the beginning of a meeting with members of Congress on investing in broadband infrastructure, Harris noted she has family members who live in San Jose and has worked with the mayor and police department there. “My prayers and my thoughts are with all of those families affected,” Harris told reporters. “The President has been briefed on the mass shooting and the tragic loss of life in San Jose by his Homeland Security Advisor, Liz Sherwood-Randall. The White House continues to monitor the situation and remains in close contact with local officials to offer any assistance as needed,” the statement said. Local authorities said eight people were killed in the attack, in addition to the shooter, who was identified as an employee of the Valley Transportation Authority. Multiple other people were injured in the shooting, and a police spokesperson warned the death toll could still rise. NBC News, which obtained the letter, reports that staffers have claimed that the Biden administration has continued to “invalidate our injuries and experiences,” and they are calling for the condition to be treated more seriously. Last month, The New York Times reported that there had been more than 130 incidents of Havana syndrome among US diplomats, spies and defence officials, some of them very recently. The Times said three CIA officers had reported serious symptoms since December, following overseas assignments. ’s world affairs editor, Julian Borger, reported at the time: “It’s June or bust,” Scott told a PBS Newshour reporter. “We’ve got three weeks in June to get this done.”  Scott is one of three lawmakers, along with Democratic congresswoman Karen Bass and Democratic Senator Cory Booker, who are involved in the negotiations over the bill. Joe Biden had originally said he hoped to sign the bill by the one-year anniversary of the death of George Floyd, the Black man who was murdered by a white Minneapolis police officer last May. But that anniversary came and went yesterday without a final deal on the policing bill. Biden met yesterday with some of Floyd’s family members, who urged Congress to pass the legislation as quickly as possible. Speaking to reporters this afternoon, deputy White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said policing reform remains a “top priority” for the president. “He is going to continue to work on this today, tomorrow and every day,” Jean-Pierre said.  In a statement issued Wednesday, Biden said: “I had the privilege of serving alongside John in the Senate for three decades. The John Warner I knew was guided by two things: his conscience and our Constitution. And, when acting in accordance with both, he neither wavered in his convictions nor was concerned with the consequences.” He added: “When told that if he voted in a way that was not in line with his party’s position—as he did numerous times on issues of rational gun policy, women’s rights, and judicial nominees—that “people would say,” his favorite rejoinder was, “Let ‘em say it.” “Indeed, that was his response when, in one of the great honors of my career, he crossed party lines to support me in the 2020 election.” Biden ended the statement by saying “our hearts and prayers are with his family”. “This face-to-face greeting, during which Biden would be joined by first lady Jill Biden, is expected to take place before the president leaves the United Kingdom following the Group of 7 summit,” CNN reported, citing an unnamed US official. The official reportedly said the White House and Buckingham Palace were finalizing details on Wednesday, and an announcement was expected in the coming days. The Queen, who is 95 years-old and is the world’s longest-reigning monarch, has met every US president since Harry Truman, with the exception of Lyndon Johnson. If the meeting goes ahead, Biden would be the 13th American president she has met.“We’ve been very clear with the WHO to continue to get to the bottom of this,” the deputy press secretary said. “We’re going to continue working with the WHO.” Jean-Pierre noted Joe Biden brought the US back into the WHO after Donald Trump withdrew from the organization, and she said the president made that decision partly to hold the group accountable when it comes to investigating the origins of coronavirus. The White House press briefing has now concluded.The New York Times reporter noted that Jean-Pierre’s boss, press secretary Jen Psaki, had been emphasizing the World Health Organization’s investigation (rather than a domestic investigation) as recently as last week. Jean-Pierre insisted nothing has changed in recent days, telling reporters, “We don’t speak about everything under review.” Biden’s announcement came days after the Wall Street Journal broke news of a previously undisclosed US intelligence report about three Wuhan researchers being hospitalized with coronavirus-like symptoms in November 2019, intensifying speculation that the virus spread as the result of a lab accident.The deputy White House press secretary repeatedly emphasized that the administration will have more information to offer on the investigation into the origins of coronavirus once the 90-day intelligence community review is completed. Jean-Pierre repeatedly criticized China for not being transparent with its information on the origins of the virus, echoing comments from other senior administration officials and international leaders.“Our hearts go out to the victims and their families,” Jean-Pierre said. “There is an ongoing investigation, as we all know. We will continue to stay in close contact with them and offer any assistance as needed.” San Jose officials have just confirmed that eight people died in the shooting, in addition to the shooter, who reportedly died by suicide after the attack. A police spokesperson warned that the number of victims could change, as multiple other people were injured in the attack. “It’s a real honor to just be standing here today. I appreciate the historic nature” of this moment, the deputy White House press secretary said. But Jean-Pierre emphasized that this administration is not about any one person and is instead focused on the collective efforts to improve American lives. She also promised to be “truthful” and “transparent” while speaking to the press. “Clearly, the president believes representation matters, and I appreciate him giving me this opportunity,” Jean-Pierre said.

Stena Line has called on the Government to fully reinstate the Common Travel Area and open a de facto “bubble” with British travellers.The ferry company, which has had its worst trading year on record due to Covid-19, believes the UK’s relaxation on travel rules rendered the ongoing restrictions on passenger travel pointless.“We are hoping to see an opening up and reinstatement of the Common Travel Area from Britain to the Republic,” the company’s spokesman Simon Palmer told The .“We have this situation at the moment where the UK haven’t been imposing any restrictions on anyone travelling from the Republic but the Republic have.”Under the current conditions, Mr Palmer said, it was quite possible for people from both jurisdictions to mix via Northern Ireland, while still being prevented from moving by ferry.“An alternative option would be to have a travel bubble between Ireland and Britain,” he said. As with its competitors, Stena Line typically relies on both freight and passengers to make a profit. Since the pandemic took hold, however, only the former has offered viable ongoing business revenue.“It’s dire,” Mr Palmer said. “Last year was the worst year in our 58-year history.”The company has also appealed for some notice period on when the rules would change. Last week it announced it would be returning its newest vessel, the Estrid, to its key Holyhead to Dublin route.It had been moved due to increased freight demand on direct routes to France and low travel volumes between Ireland and Wales.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

He added: “We know there are new variants spreading in Europe. There are new variants spreading in the UK. There are relatively high case rates in a number of European countries.”Prof McLysaght said the uncertainty surrounding the transmissibility of the Indian variant means it is worth waiting a number of weeks to observe what occurs in the UK, which is also reopening society while the variant is in circulation.“In a few weeks it will be quite clear,” she said. “It will either be that something unusual happened in Bolton – bad luck and a few different factors coinciding – or there is some biological feature of the variant that makes it more transmissible.“The price of waiting those few weeks to have more certainty is quite slim – it’s a holding pattern – but the potential cost of opening up now, if it is as bad as it might be, is really huge, and I think that’s a point that needs to be made quite clearly.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus 448 new cases reported in the state","story":"The Department of Health said that the daily number of cases may change due to future data validation.

Keep windows and doors open where possible and avoid cramped, crowded settings.”Wednesday saw the eighth consecutive day in Northern Ireland where no further deaths of patients who had previously tested positive for Covid-19 were notified.The Department of Health said another 66 positive cases had been confirmed, while there were 28 Covid-positive patients in hospital, of whom two were in intensive care. – PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"darkest days of pandemic have passed says donnelly","story":"Mr Donnelly said: ‘We must and are working to move care out of acute hospitals into the community.’Photograph: Julien Behal PhotographyThe darkest days of the Covid-19 pandemic have now passed, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has said.He said in a few months he hoped the Government would be in a position to take stock and put in place “appropriate measures” to recognise the contributions made by healthcare staff over the last year or so.Fórsa represents health and social care professional staff as well as managerial and administrative grades in the health service.Mr Donnelly said significant numbers of additional staff had been recruited in both these areas on foot of the Government decision last year to boost the health service workforce.“In the 12 months to March 2021 alone, almost 8,000 more staff have been added to the public health service, including over 1,200 health and social care professionals and over 1,300 management and administrative roles. We also plan to maximise the recruitment of healthcare graduates in 2021. These valuable and valued additional staff have helped the health service meet the challenges posed and will continue to help the country as we enter, hopefully, the final phase of this dreadful pandemic.”Mr Donnelly said he was hopeful “that within a few months from today, our vaccine rollout will bring us to a place where we will be able to look back at the pandemic, to take stock of healthcare workers’ huge contributions, and to put in place appropriate measures to recognise these”.The Minister told the conference that essential to delivering the Government’s plans for universal healthcare would be “the shift of services”.“We must and are working to move care out of acute hospitals into the community and closer to people’s homes”, he said.He said enhanced community care workstreams would “ensure maximum impact for people in avoiding hospital admission as far as possible”.He said the Government planned to establish 96 community healthcare networks to enable integrated care and would be recruiting up to 7,000 community-based healthcare staff.The head of Fórsa’s health ision Éamonn Donnelly said the union’s members would be at the forefront of a new community-led health model. He said, quite simply, it could not be achieved without them.He urged the Government to appoint a health and social care professional policy advisor in the Department of Health and said his members “cannot accept anything less”.He said the Sláintecare reform programme needed to be the model that provided people with the right care, in the right place and at the right time with the least level of complexity. He said it could not be “just another re-structuring”.Mr Donnelly said the health service was not “bloated with managers” as its critics sometimes argued.He said these very same managers at the onset of the pandemic worked 70 or 80 hours per week every week without access to compensatory rest.Fórsa general secretary Kevin Callinan said he had told the Taoiseach and other Ministers that the most fitting tribute to the efforts of healthcare workers during the pandemic “would be a determination to fix the two-tier nature of our health system once and for all and to invest in developing a universal, state of-the-art service second to none”.“For too long successive Governments have fudged this fundamental duty to citizens.

Photograph: PAThe incoming DUP leader has claimed in the Stormont Assembly that North-South relations have “never been worse”.He was answering questions in the Assembly on Tuesday in his capacity as the North’s Minister for Agriculture.“As a consequence of that every home is being damaged, and on the Executive’s papers . . . in every area of health, in medical devices and medicines we are in the red zone, that is a zone that we have been put there as a result of the protocol which was driven very heavily by the former taoiseach and tánaiste,” Mr Poots claimed.Reassurances“So Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland relations are very bad and they need to be fixed, but we need to get some reassurances that we’re going to get something considerably better than we currently are in terms of protocol to fix those relations.”The North’s Minister for Agriculture, Nichola Mallon, said on Tuesday that she had sought legal advice over the DUP’s boycott of some North-South Ministerial Council meetings as part of its campaign against the Northern Ireland protocol.Unionists are opposed to the protocol because it places a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea, and Mr Poots has pledged that as DUP leader he will take a tougher stance against the protocol.The absence of the DUP has meant that some of the council’s meetings have been unable to take place.“I understand the DUP are having new leadership but, regardless of who the leader is, they have legal responsibilities and I am so concerned by this matter that I have sought legal advice from the attorney general on this particular issue,” Ms Mallon said.Mr Poots was speaking in the Assembly in response to a question from the SDLP Assembly member (MLA) Patsy McGlone, who asked him to “confirm that he would not obstruct any further North-South meetings”.Defend recordThe incoming DUP leader also said he “remained committed to all of my duties as a Minister in this devolved assembly” and went on to defend his record on North-South co-operation, citing his role as a former minister for health in the establishment of a cross-Border radiotherapy service at Altnagelvin hospital in Derry and the agreement that paediatric cardiac patients from the North could receive surgery in Dublin.Asked by the DUP MLA Keith Buchanan for the staffing cost incurred at Northern Ireland’s ports because of the implementation of the protocol, Mr Poots said the figure came to almost £24.5 million (€28.3 million) since June 2020.Meanwhile, the DUP met David Frost, the UK minister responsible for EU relations, on Tuesday and called again for the replacement of the protocol.DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson said there had been a “direct and forthright exchange of views” and they had made clear that the UK government “must act carefully but decisively to restore the delicate balance of community relations in the coming days”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"cervicalcheck tribunal has received just three of 250 claims lodged against state","story":"Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald called on Taoiseach Micheál Martin to intervene. File photograph: Gettty ImagesThe CervicalCheck tribunal established as an alternative option to the courts for dealing with claims against the State has “struck an iceberg” and is not working, the Dáil has been told.The tribunal established at the start of the year has received no further claims beyond the three originally submitted and Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald called on Taoiseach Micheál Martin to intervene.Ms McDonald cited the latest figures and said that “as of this month, in total 250 claims have been made by women against the State, women who were damaged and injured by the CervicalCheck scandal.“Court proceedings have been issued in 190 claims and 31 claims have been concluded,” she said.However, “as of May 12th of the 160 active court cases involving women affected by this scandal only three have been transferred to the tribunal”.The 221 Plus support group for women affected by the scandal, “are very critical of the tribunal, as you know”, Ms McDonald told the Taoiseach. “They’ve no confidence in it - they say it’s struck an iceberg. And the women affected equally have no confidence by the way in the Minister for Health, or the process over which he presides.”Stating that the tribunal was not working, Ms McDonald asked the Taoiseach “how will you intervene”, given the seriousness of the issue, the ordeal the women have been through, and “given the very significant public concern on this matter”.Mr Martin acknowledged that three claims had been received by the tribunal and said “these have been advanced promptly. It is our view that the tribunal offers a far more effective and quicker approach in getting claims resolved and dealt with”.He added that the tribunal offered a number of advantages compared to a High Court claim, and was “an alternative venue for the exclusive purpose of dealing with the claims promptly”.He said people were obviously entitled to use the courts but “we do believe the tribunal offers a very good approach”.The tribunal was established in the wake of a report by Mr Justice Charles Meenan setting out the urgent need for an alternative system for hearing claims, because many women involved were seriously ill.The controversy over the cervical screening programme was sparked by the 2018 High Court settlement of an action by Limerick woman Vicky Phelan, who has cervical cancer, over the reading of her smear test. It later emerged that more than 100 other women had not been informed of an audit that had revised their earlier, negative smear tests. Some are taking legal cases against the testing labs and the Health Service Executive (HSE).The final date on which a woman can make a claim to the tribunal, or transfer a case from the High Court, is currently July 26th this year.The Minister for Health formally began the work of the tribunal last December after talks with 221 Plus stalled.The group had been looking for assurances in relation to the statute of limitations and the ability of women to return to the tribunal should they suffer a recurrence of cancer. Those talks collapsed as the group said they felt those issues were not fully addressed.

The Dáil passed the Sinn Féin motion itself on Wednesday night.The Government had in a debate on Tuesday night supported the Sinn Féin proposal and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said during debate on the issue that “we need to be honest with what is happening on the ground and call it out” as “de facto annexation”.He added that the Republic is the first EU country to state this and it could be a message to the global community.Mr Coveney echoed the comments of Sinn Féin foreign affairs spokesman John Brady, who said that “we are baldly stating that Israel is acting illegally under international law”.Sinn Féin had accepted for their motion a Government amendment condemning the actions of militant Palestinian group Hamas.Cabinet meetingA Cabinet meeting was held on Tuesday and agreed to back the Sinn Féin proposal if the party included reference to violence “on all sides in the conflict”, following intense violence in the Gaza region over the past two weeks before a ceasefire was called.More than 240 Palestinians have been killed in the outbreak of violence, including 66 children, with 10 Israeli deaths, including two children.Mr Coveney had said he found it “deeply troubling” that Sinn Féin could not bring itself to also condemn the actions of Hamas for also killing children and innocent civilians.However, when the Minister insisted in Tuesday’s debate on the condemnation of “the killing of civilians by both sides in this conflict”, Sinn Féin accepted this amendment without a vote.People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett, speaking before the vote on his party’s amendment, described it as “historic” and said that it was the first time the Irish parliament would vote on the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador.“Most likely it is the first time any parliament in the EU has held such a vote,” he said.Amendment wordingThe rejected amendment stated that “the Israeli apartheid system through its ongoing ethnic cleansing, brutal state repression and murderous military violence, including four savage military assaults on Gaza in recent years, has no place among the international community of nations”.It called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador and “all Israeli diplomatic staff”, as well as for the application of “a comprehensive package of economic, political and cultural sanctions against the state of Israel, similar to that applied to apartheid South Africa”.The amendment also called for the maintenance of such sanctions and their promotion within the EU and internationally “until the entire Israeli apartheid system is dismantled and all the Palestinian people enjoy national self-determination and full and equal rights”.

However, thresholds for the targets have yet to be decided.Ministers will consider the plans with a final decision expected this summer.The four-hour target introduced by Labour in 2004 originally said 98 per cent of A\u0026ampE patients should be admitted to hospital or discharged within four hours, with the level cut to 95 per cent in 2010.However, the target has not been met since July 2015, with latest data for England showing just 85.4 per cent of patients seen within target in April.Prof John Appleby, chief economist at thinktank the Nuffield Trust, said: Before we change the target, we should ask why it has not been met for the last five years.It’s not clear from this paper what the actual level of the new targets will be, so we are left wondering how the commitment to patients will compare to the guarantee they have today.We still haven’t seen full data from the trial phase, and there is a risk that this just looks like moving the goalposts.Yesterday, NHS England issued findings from a public consultation, which ended on 12 February with 354 responses, including 157 patients and 101 NHS trusts. It found 67 per cent of trusts and 55 per cent of patients approved of the proposals.The consultation found 95 per cent of people understood the four hour target. Respondents were not questioned on their understanding of the replacement measures, but were asked if they wanted to replace the current measure with a bundle of measures with thresholds yet to be determined.Prof Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said: Since the previous standards were introduced in 2004, there have been many innovations in urgent treatment and care, so it is right we listen to patients, the public and other experts to ensure NHS services deliver what matters most to patients as well as what is most important clinically.Dr Katherine Henderson, President of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine said: We support an implementation of a bundle of metrics, that will provide better information than the four-hour target.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"arab states accept sham syria elections assad returns fold","story":"Polling stations opened Wednesday for Syrians in government-controlled areas, in an election pre-ordained to hand President Bashar al-Assad a fourth term amid collapsing regional consensus over the need for transition following Syria’s civil war. The vote is the second election since the start of the war in 2011 but has been rejected by Syrian opposition and described by the United Kingdom, United States and European Union as “neither free nor fair”. Despite violence in Syria’s war declining significantly, half the population is still displaced, while the economy is suffering its most precipitous collapse since fighting began.Syrian allies Russia and Iran – alongside an emerging bloc of Arab states – are banking that rehabilitating Assad could aid reconstruction and encourage refugee returns. Assad, 55, took power in a referendum in 2000 following the death of his father Hafez, who ruled Syria for 30 years. Beyond the ubiquitous postering of his face across government-controlled areas, the former London-trained ophthalmologist has done little campaigning against two symbolic rivals approved to give a veneer of legitimacy to the extension of Assad’s mandate.Few consider former state minister Abdallah Salloum Abdallah and Mahmoud Merhi, a member of the so-called tolerated opposition, serious contenders. During the previous presidential election in 2014, Assad took nearly 88 per cent of the vote in a process billed as the first multi-candidate vote in a half century of Hafez family rule (with their previous mandates established by referenda).Mohammad Khaled al-Rahmoun, Syrian interior minister, said on Tuesday that 18 million Syrians are eligible to vote but few expect anywhere that number to cast a ballot, with opponents of Assad unlikely to participate in a process structured to validate his rule. Opposition-controlled Idlib – now home to over 4.4 million people – will not participate, while refugees who fled Syria without obtaining an official exit stamp are banned from voting. Meanwhile several countries with large Syrian refugee populations, including Turkey and Germany, have blocked voting.The vote is taking place in defiance of a 2015 United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a new constitution ahead of elections but a collapsing regional commitment to the resolution has seen increasing numbers of Arab states accept the sham elections as evidence of a genuine political transition.Last month Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry claimed that the vote would allow the Syrian people to “choose their future and form a government that represents them.”States like Egypt may cite the election as reason to readmit Syria to the Arab League, from which it was suspended in November 2011. While sclerotic and functionally irrelevant, Syria’s readmission to the body would symbolise the completion of Assad’s regional rehabilitation, a process that has progressed significantly in the past few years.The United Arab Emirates, which once supported Syrian rebels, reopened its embassy in Damascus in December 2018, followed shortly afterwards by Bahrain. The move reflected growing Arab concern over their diminished role in Syria amid the growing influence of Turkey and Iran.Even Saudi Arabia is making overtures towards Damascus, earlier this month dispatching intelligence chief Gen Khalid Humeidan for the first known meeting with his Syrian counterpart since the start of the war. The regional impact of Syria’s collapsing economy may be driving re-engagement. More than 80 per cent of Syria’s population now live in poverty amid runaway inflation. A recent survey carried out in the capital showed that nearly two in three Damascenes want to emigrate, with the majority citing declining living standards as the biggest factor.Suffering under sanctions and saddled with debt, the government has turned on former regime insiders for shakedowns. Among those targeted is Assad’s cousin Rami Makhlouf, once known as Mr Five Per Cent for the cut he was reputed to take from any new business venture.A new class of warlords, smugglers and racketeers has taken the place of the former business elite. The country now produces so much of the methamphetamine captagon that experts describe Syria as a narco-state.In April, Saudi customs intercepted millions of dollars of captagon hidden in pomegranates arriving from Lebanon, which is a conduit for Syrian drug exports. The find alarmed Saudi officials enough that they banned imports of produce from Lebanon, which is suffering its own economic collapse.While the West continues to oppose the vote, their words will be powerless to halt the process. “A legitimate election can only follow an inclusive and transparent process” – as laid out by the UN Security Council in resolution 2254 – “where all eligible voters can take part, free from intimidation,” said Jonathan Hargreaves, UK Special Representative for Syria.Assad responded to those views on Wednesday by saying that Syria would disregard them. The “value of those opinions is zero,” he said. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"astrazeneca did not try respect contract eu brussels lawyers","story":"The EU is demanding 10 euros for each day of delay for every inidual dose of vaccine as penalties for each breach of contract with AstraZeneca.Brussels took the British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant to a Belgian court in April after AstraZeneca said it would only supply 100m vaccines by the end of June, rather than the 300m jabs promised in the contract.The commission now wants the company to deliver at least 120m doses by the end of June and has demanded UK-manufactured AstraZeneca jabs to hit that target or face the daily fine.“AstraZeneca did not even try to respect the contract, lawyer Rafael Jafferali, told the Brussels court in the first hearing on the substance of the legal case.Lawyers added that they also want 10 million euros as penalties for each breach of the contract that the judge may decide. A verdict is expected next month.Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, has repeatedly blamed AstraZeneca shortfalls for the initially slow pace of the EU’s vaccination roll-out.The Commission also accuses AstraZeneca of failing to provide enough notice for the large cuts in deliveries. The company insists it is not in breach of its contract, which it says only requires it to make best reasonable efforts in delivering doses. Its lawyers will address the court later.AstraZeneca’s contract with the UK gives it first refusal on UK-manufactured jabs, which further increased Brexit tensions between Britain and the EU at the start of the year, which were exacerbated by the successful British roll-out.There were also suspicions in Berlin and Brussels that some EU-reserved stock had ended up in the UK.Mr Jafferali said that the “best reasonable efforts” principle was not respected because the drugmaker had not delivered the 50m doses produced in the factories listed in the contracts, which includes the two British plants.The lawyer said AstraZeneca had failed to communicate to the EU in a timely manner the magnitude of its supply problems. It had repeatedly sent messages that it was able to meet its targets, before finally admitting there were large shortfalls in March, he said. The company had warned the EU in December of production problems, but communicated only at the end of January, just before the start of deliveries, a much larger cut than initially expected for the first-quarter.There were further controversies over false claims regarding the vaccine’s efficacy, which hit pick up of the jab across the EU, before a link between it and very rare blood clots was found, which resulted in some countries introducing age restrictions on the jab. Mrs von der Leyen said on Tuesday night that the EU had made “great progress” in vaccinations since May but warned that variants of the virus remained a public health risk. Speaking after an EU summit, she said, “By the end of the week, over 300m doses of vaccines will have been delivered to member states. And in June, we expect more than 400m doses.“So we are on track to reach our goal to have enough doses being delivered to vaccinate 70 per cent of the adult population in the European Union by the end of July. If we continue like this, we have confidence that we will be able to safely reopen our societies.”The Commission has said it will not renew its contracts with AstraZeneca. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"batley grammar teacher allowed back school prophet mohammed","story":"The Batley Grammar teacher who showed a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed in class will be allowed to return to the classroom but the picture should not be used again in any lesson, the Trust has said.The Religious Studies (RS) teacher, who was forced into hiding after receiving death threats, had not intended to cause offence, an investigation into the incident found.The investigation, commissioned by the Batley Multi Academy Trust, found that the teacher “genuinely believed” that the image had “an educational purpose and benefit”.The Trust said it was not necessary to use pictures of the Prophet Muhammed in RS lessons or any other lessons out of “respect” for the views of the school community.It added that it will not avoid addressing challenging subject matter but at the same time is committed to ensuring that offence is not caused. Critics have warned that teachers should not face a religious veto on what material they can use in the classroom, adding that the Trust\u0027s stance is a route to censorship. Batley Grammar School  sent pupils home early for the Easter holidays and issued an apology after a group of Muslims gathered at the gates to protest.The headmaster announced that  the Religious Studies teacher had been suspended while the school looked into what happened.The teacher - who was branded a “terrorist” by one Muslim community leader - reportedly said he feared he and his family would be murdered and that he would never be able to return to his job or home.The academy trust that runs Batley Grammar School then announced that it would carry out an independent investigation into the context in which the cartoon was shown.Stephen Evans, chief executive of the National Secular Society,  said he welcomes the decision to lift the teachers\u0027 suspensions. “But the trust’s stated commitment to ensuring offence is not caused is a route to censorship, and sets a very poor precedent, he said.  “The outcome of this local investigation will affect teachers’ ability to do their jobs across the country. So the government should face questions over its failure to show leadership when fundamental principles were at stake. “Teachers must be able to explore challenging issues in the classroom and shouldn\u0027t face a religious veto on which resources they can use.”The Trust\u0027s full report was not published but the executive summary cited guidelines from the Department for Education which state that schools are allowed to include a range of ideas and materials in lessons, including where they are “challenging or controversial”.The report said that schools must balance this with the need to promote respect and tolerance between people of different faiths and beliefs, including in deciding which materials to use in the classroom. The investigators said that “great care must be taken” that lessons featuring controversial topics are taught in a way that “promotes respect and tolerance between people of different faiths, beliefs and values”.The report went on to say: “In the light of the above, and in respect of the views of our school community the Trust is clear that it is not necessary for staff to use the material in question to deliver the learning outcomes on the subject of blasphemy or any such images of the type used on 22 March for use in any Trust RS lessons, or any other lessons”.Batley Multi Academy Trust said it accepts all the report’s recommendations, adding: “The findings are clear, that the teaching staff involved did not use the resource with the intention of causing offence, and that the topics covered by the lesson could have been effectively addressed in other ways.“In the light of those conclusions, the suspensions put in place while the investigation was underway will now be lifted.” It is not known whether the teachers will return to the classroom. A spokesman for the Trust added: The Trust deeply regrets the distress caused by the use of this resource, and we would like to thank all of the Trust’s stakeholders for their contributions and support during what has been a difficult period.  All those in our Trust’s family – whether parents, staff or members of our wider school community – want us to continue to provide a high-quality education so that our students aspire to excellence and achieve their full potential, both in their academic studies and personal development.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"did national trust end sorry state","story":"In the heritage world, David has just beaten Goliath. This week, Tim Parker, chairman of the National Trust, resigned after seven years in the role – and just 24 hours after a rebel group of members launched a bid to depose him at the annual general meeting.Restore Trust – of which I am a member – was only founded last month. It already has 10,000 supporters and a fighting fund of £50,000. It was founded to restore the trust to its original aims – to concentrate on conservation, an aesthetic experience, a sense of place, a feeling of welcome and an apolitical ethos. It has claimed a major scalp in the shape of Tim Parker.“This is the first step in a very important process,” a Restore Trust spokesman told me, “returning the trust to its true purpose, to care for the nation’s heritage – you can’t do that if you’re denouncing it. It’s vital it now has a chairman who cares about Britain’s heritage and can rebuild trust in the organisation.”It’s also a victory for grassroots members and volunteers over the National Trust management. During the past four years, the trust has become disastrously politicised. That – and the trust’s catastrophic dumbing-down – has been snowballing for 20 years.This decline has been at the hands of the trust’s management. The members and volunteers have only ever wanted what the trust was founded to do: preserve buildings of national interest, along with their furniture and pictures, and preserve beautiful landscapes. It’s the management that’s turned political.Last September, the trust published a report into the links between its properties – including Chartwell, the home of Winston Churchill – and Britain’s past colonial and slavery connections. The report was sloppy and littered with errors, like so much of the trust’s literature in recent years.Parker’s tenure as chairman since 2014 has only intensified the politicisation. At last year’s annual meeting, he said the trust had “not become a political organisation that has been taken over by a bunch of woke folk”. Yet in recent years, the trust has become increasingly political in its focus.There’s nothing wrong in the trust researching historical slavery links with its houses. But, as well as publishing its self-lacerating 2020 study, snappily entitled ‘Interim Report on the Connections between Colonialism and Properties now in the Care of the National Trust, Including Links with Historic Slavery’, in recent years it has launched a series of political initiatives slanted at attacking historical attitudes – and the owners of its houses – for not following modern progressive opinions.Any idea of praising the trust’s extraordinary contribution to British architectural, artistic and intellectual history has been eclipsed by this obsession with attacking “old-fashioned” attitudes.In 2018, the trust explored women’s history and suffrage via the anniversary of women gaining the vote in 1918. Of course, women getting the vote was a marvellous thing, but it is the trust’s job to look after houses and landscapes – not to celebrate political anniversaries.In 2017, as part of the trust’s ‘Prejudice and Pride’ season, it outed as gay Robert Wyndham Ketton-Cremer (1906-69), the kind man who’d given Felbrigg Hall to the trust. It also tried and failed to stop volunteers who refused to wear rainbow-coloured lanyards from working with the public.That year, in 2017, I went to the National Trust’s AGM in Swindon. Many of the members were up in arms. They had trekked hundreds of miles to the meeting on a cold, windy day – and their complaints were comprehensively ignored.One member, Stephen Green from Carmarthen, was outraged about what happened at Felbrigg. He asked the chairman if he would stop the trust being a political campaigning organisation that represented the “few who live and breathe political correctness”.Parker was the master of the non-apology apology: half-saying sorry, and then quickly snatching it away. He admitted that, with the benefit of hindsight, the Felbrigg incident had been a “small misjudgement”. But then he went on to say he was surprised and bemused by the hoohah.At the AGM, Patrick Streeter, a National Trust member from Essex, asked for an apology over the Felbrigg saga. Parker apologised “for any offence caused” – another classic non-apology apology.The trust also denies the catastrophic dumbing-down of its properties. Parker said: “We are not engaged in some social engineering experiment to thin out the intellectual content of our house presentation.”But the thinning-out of intellectual content at trust properties is undeniable. Last year, the trust set out its proposals for ‘Curation and Experience’, as part of its ‘Reset’ programme. It planned to get rid of all the lead curators in the regions and many junior curators. That meant losing talented scholars in architecture, archaeology, historic gardens, paintings and artefacts.Also last year, in a report called ‘Towards a 10-year vision for places and experiences, version 2.1’, Tony Berry, the trust’s Director of Visitor Experience, said he wanted to “dial down” the trust’s role as a big cultural institution and move away from looking after English country houses. The trust planned to put its collections in storage and hold fewer exhibitions at its properties to prioritise its role as the “gateway to the outdoors”. The 10-year strategy also attacked the “outdated mansion experience”.In 2017, I gave the Charles Douglas-Home Memorial Lecture, which I entitled “Betrayal of Trust: How the National Trust is losing its way”. I spent months touring trust houses and was staggered by the intellectual collapse of an organisation I’d revered since childhood.The trust’s house guides were littered with spelling mistakes. At Hughenden Manor, the Buckinghamshire house of Victorian prime minister Benjamin Disraeli, the trust’s official literature described his climb into “high soceity”. Isaac D’Israeli, Disraeli’s father, was called “Isaace” closely was spelt “closey”.It’s not just the lack of attention to detail baby language was everywhere at trust properties. At Osterley Park, the elegant Adam house on the fringes of west London, the servants’ quarters were decorated with a sign saying: “It was the scullery maid’s job to empty and clean the chamber pots every morning. A very smelly job.” A tree stump at Hughenden had a sign next to it, reading: “Please do not climb on me.”The trust has been dumbing down for 20 years, ever since Dame Fiona Reynolds, a senior civil servant, became its director general.Dame Helen Ghosh, Reynolds’s successor as director general, accelerated the dumbing-down. She even removed furniture from the fine Regency library at Ickworth House, Suffolk, temporarily replacing it with beanbags. There was “so much stuff” in trust houses, she said, that it put people off. Exhibits needed to be “simplified”.The trust is an astonishingly successful organisation, with just under six million members. And yet its management is tortured by paroxysms of self-hating agony because those six million people are largely white, middle-class and middle-aged.“Accessibility” is the trust’s great false god. Of course, anyone can go to any trust property they want. And yet the trust is deeply depressed when the visitor profile is dominated by the pale and stale. And so they’ve become obsessed with changing that profile.A former chairman, Sir Simon Jenkins, was once told by a trust employee that it “feared” many of its new members were “over 50”. As Jenkins said: “In 15 years, half the population would be over 50 and a third over 60. It was good news.”Most charities, anywhere in the world, would be delighted with six million members, of any age or skin colour. Only the National Trust is mad – and rude – enough to take against the background of its members: the people who pay for the trust, volunteer for it and love it.And, as a now-dead former senior employee of the trust once told me: “What you must understand is that a lot of senior people at the trust actually don’t like old buildings.”This whole process – the politicisation and the sad dumbing-down – need never have taken place. English Heritage has maintained its properties with no dumbing down and none of its members has complained.Here’s hoping the new National Trust chairman will end the politics and the hatred of the past and concentrate on the job – looking after its artistic, architectural and landscape treasures.Harry Mount is author of How England Made the English. To order your copy for £8.99, call 0844 851 1514 or visit the  BookshopMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"extinct giant tortoise found galapagos","story":"A giant tortoise found on the Galapagos Islands is from a species last seen more than a century ago, scientists have confirmed.An elderly female tortoise discovered during a 2019 expedition has been identified as a chelonoidis phantasticus, also known as fernandina giant tortoise.Until now the only inidual was collected in 1906 by researchers from the California Academy of Sciences, which was carrying out a survey of the island\u0027s flora and fauna.They brought a sample back to the university, allowing Yale University scientists to make a comparison with the female 113 years later.The female is currently at a breeding centre in Santa Cruz Island, California, but scientists have found prints and droppings on Fernandina Island and think there are more living in the wild, though there have been no other confirmed sightings.Fernandina Island, the third-largest in the Galapagos archipelago, is the site of an active volcano that erupts frequently, leading to fears for the tortoise\u0027s survival.Ecuador\u0027s environment minister celebrated the discovery, writing in a tweet: It was believed extinct more than 100 years ago! Hope is alive.Danny Rueda, director of the Galapagos National Park, said that a future expedition would look for more iniduals.

He hypnotises you,” said the former official, who resigned last year shortly after the anti-government protests broke out.Mr Lukashenko was born to a single mother in the Vitebsk region of what was then the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1954.And he has repeatedly demonstrated that he has no problem jailing, torturing, and exiling those he deems a threat.He kept those close to him off balance with frequent reshuffles, promotions and demotions designed to prevent an elite gathering enough power to challenge him.And he successfully played off Vladimir Putin\u0027s need to keep Belarus close to Russia against the EU\u0027s hopes of democratising it.“Charming might be going too far, he could be pleasant and mild when he wishes too, said Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow at the international institute for strategic studies and former UK diplomat who served as UK ambassador to Minsk between 2007 and 2009.But below the surface there is always the sense of someone who is constantly assessing their interlocutors with this almost animal sense - maybe animal scent, in fact - of what power is, and where it lies. Which is quite disconcerting.”The combination of repression, Soviet nostalgia, and cunning was a winning combination for several years.Nexta, the independent media outlet, claimed in a recent documentary that he has massively enriched himself during his time in office, making use of nearly two dozen official residences, two private jets and luxury cars which are not owned in his name.

The transparent rigging of last August’s presidential election his mishandling of the Covid epidemic, which has seen him mock both science and victims and a years long economic malaise has seen whatever legitimacy he used to enjoy among the public melt away.Faced with enormous protests against his rule, he refused to back down -  at one point telling heckling factory workers that he would only leave office if they killed him.Instead, he sought to crush the opposition with incredible violence. Since August last year, thousands of people have been detained, beaten and tortured journalists have been arrested and their outlets shut down and the number of political prisoners has shot up from the low double digits, where it hovered for most of his rule, to 426.Fear, after all, is one of Mr Lukashenko\u0027s most powerful tools.The official said during a lengthy meeting last year, she noticed a stare that Mr Lukashenko gave to another official: “He didn’t say anything to that man.

He was always very firm that it should remain non-political, and keen for it to become as businesslike as possible.The Trust said Mr Parker had already served two three-year terms and agreed to a third exceptional term to oversee the charity through the Covid crisis.It began attracting criticism during the regime of its previous director-general, Dame Helen Ghosh, who ran it from 2012 until 2018.Her successor, Hilary McGrady, courted controversy when overseeing the publication of a 115-page report which blacklisted 93 of its estates over their links to slavery, including Sir Winston Churchill\u0027s home at Chartwell in Kent.Critics allege that influential senior managers and advisers have pushed a more politicised agenda and want a new chairman to try to curb any future projects that might be seen to be straying outside the National Trust\u0027s traditional remit to preserve historic properties and countryside and keep them open to the public.It is understood that the controversial report into colonial connections at Trust properties was commissioned by the charity\u0027s influential Curation and Experience Department under the management of John Orna-Ornstein, a museum specialist who was appointed in 2017.The original project was launched in 2018 and the final report published last year, sparking an outcry.In August 2020, Mr Orna-Ornstein said the Black Lives Matter movement had made the Trust realise that we need to go much faster in addressing colonialism and slavery. Sources suggested Mr Parker had little direct involvement and remained remote from this area of work. Conservative MPs have called for the next chairman to be elected by the Trust\u0027s members and said the successful candidate needed to keep its management under a stricter watch.Sir John Hayes, the chairman of the Common Sense Group of around 60 Tory MPs, said the next chairman should overhaul the board to remove any metropolitan glitterati.The next chairman has got to recognise that the Trust has lost its way and needs to return to the principles upon which it was founded, he added. The maintenance and promotion of our heritage isn\u0027t about the faddish preoccupation with all kinds of trendy, right-on causes and campaigns.Andrew Murrison MP, a former minister, said he was worried the new appointment would be stitched up by the other board members.Mr Murrison said the successful candidate had to be put forward to an approval vote at the AGM on Oct 30 in the same way that Parliament is allowed a confirmation hearing for senior public appointments, adding: Most people would be surprised that some input from the membership was not in place already in choosing the chairman.We need a high-profile chairman who can hold his or her own, who has a proven track record, will listen to the members and also be sympathetic to the extremely dedicated workforce.”Restore Trust, a group of disaffected members who were planning to table a motion calling on Mr Parker to resign, said it wanted the recruitment process to be as open as possible. A source said: “We want an open process so we can see the shortlist.”A National Trust spokesman said the appointment would be made by the National Trust Council, which is made up of 36 members who have a range of expertise in everything from education and agriculture to nature and the built environment.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"trusted instagram forex trader watched life savings disappear","story":"So where does the blame lie?

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeDominic Cummings has given a searing assessment of incompetence, failure and arrogance at the top of government as the Covid- pandemic killed thousands of people “who didn’t need to die”.In a seven-hour marathon appearance at a joint Committee of MPs, Boris Johnson ’s former top aide said his old boss had ‘ignored advice’ and was late to introduce both the first and second lockdowns.Mr Cummings claimed the PM was consistently anti-lockdown, ignored scientic advice and failed to take Covid seriously - even ranting last summer that he should never have done Lockdown .MPs heard that No  was warned the UK was “absolutely f****d” and coronavirus would “kill thousands of people” as Mr Johnson dragged his feet over bringing in the first lockdown last year - something Cummings said he “bitterly” regrets.He painted a picture of a chaotic and dysal Downing Street in denial over the scale of the disaster ahead.  Mr Cummings also turned his guns on Carrie Symonds, suggesting she had pursued “completely unethical and clearly illegal” attempts to pack No  with her own friends. But his most vicious broadsides were reserved for Health Secretary Matt Hancock, whom he branded “disgraceful” - and potentially “criminal.” Mr Cummings said there were around  reasons why Mr Hancock should have been thrown out of the Cabinet - including, he claimed, lying both in meetings and publicly.But he had no such venom for Brexiteer allies Dominic Raab, Michael Gove - and particularly Rishi Sunak, whom he described as “competent and extremely able”.With Mr Sunak long touted as a future leader, and Mr Cummings having a string of personal scores to settle, that will raise questions over the motivation behind his claims today. Questions also remain over Mr Cummings reliability, after he introduced yet another explanation of his trip to Durham at the height of the first lockdown, and claimed the borders should have been shut since January despite doing little work on Covid by then. That said, his evidence raises serious questions for Boris Johnson - and is almost impossible to wade through. So to break things into bite-sized chunks, here are the all most explosive moments in his testimony to ParliamentTens of thousands of Brits died needlessly due to government failureIn what’s ultimately his most damning admission, the ex-adviser said bluntly: Tens of thousands of people died, who didnapost need to die. Mr Cummings claimed the PM was consistently anti-lockdown, ignored scientic advice and failed to take Covid seriously. The former top aide began his evidence with a mea culpa: “The truth is senior ministers, officials and advisers like me fell short of standards the public has a right to expect. “When the public needed us most, we failed. I’d like to say to all the families how sorry I am for the mistakes we made”. PM had no idea for weeks that Covid was flowing into care homesMr Cummings revealed Boris Johnson had no idea for weeks that people leaving hospital into care weren’t being routinely tested in late March. That led to the virus being seeded into care homes and tens of thousands of residents dying. Blaming the Health Secretary, he told MPs: “[Matt] Hancock told us in the Cabinet room that people were going to be tested in care homes. What the hell happened ” He added: “It was only in April after the Prime Minister and I had both ourselves been ill that we realised that what we were told never did happen, or only happened very partially and sporadically”. He went on: “The government rhetoric was ‘we put a shield around care homes, blah blah blah’ - that was complete nonsense. “Quite the opposite of putting a shield round them, we sent people with Covid back to the care homes.”  A top official admitted ‘we’re f*****, we’re going to kill thousands’ -  days before lockdownA top No official warned “we’re absolutely f****d” as the Covid response descended into chaos, he claimed - but it still took another  days to lock down. Until the second week of March the consensus in No was that there was no point locking down because it would only delay the inevitable peak. But he claimed former Deputy Cabinet Secretary Helen Macnamara voiced early doubts. She allegedly said another top official, Mark Sweeney, had told her: “I’ve been told for years there is a whole plan for this. There is no plan. We’re in huge trouble.” Mr Cummings said Ms Macnamara told him on March : “I think we are absolutely f****d. I think this country is heading for a disaster, I think we are going to kill thousands of people.” Boris Johnson thought it was all just a ‘scare story’Mr Cummings argued it would not have been helpful for his boss to attend emergency COBRA meetings in February - five of which he missed - because he would have had flippant responses to the crisis. “The basic thought was that in February the Prime Minister regarded this as just a scare story,” said Mr Cummings. “He described it as the new swine flu.”He could’ve boasted he would be injected with Covid on TVMr Cummings insisted he “definitely” told Mr Johnson the coronavirus was not just a scare story. But in a shocking claim, he told MPs: “The view of ious officials inside No waswe have the Prime Minister chairing COBRA meetings and he just tells everyone ‘it’s swine flu, don’t worry about it, I’m going to get Chris Whitty to inject me live on TV with coronavirus so everyone realises it’s nothing to be frightened of’, that would not help actually serious planning.” Boris Johnson was told to encourage ‘chicken pox parties’ for herd immunityMr Cummings made an equally explosive allegation about then-Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill. On March , he said, “the Cabinet Secretary said ‘Prime Minister, you should go on TV tomorrow ad explain to people the herd immunity and that it’s like the old chicken pox parties - we need people to get this disease because that’s how we get herd immunity by September’. “And I said Mark you’ve got to stop using this chicken pox analogy it’s not right, and he said ‘why’. “And [data scientist] Ben Warner said ‘because chicken pox isn’t spreading exponentially and killing hundreds of thousands of people.’” Mr Cummings added: “He was saying what the official advice to him from the Department of Health was.” That day, Chief Scientist Patrick Vallance told the nation suppressing the virus completely was not “desirable” because some immunity was needed. And Boris Johnson told the nation “many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.” The nation’s top civil servant wanted Matt Hancock sacked for ‘lies’Matt Hancock should have been fired for at least - things during the Covid crisis, Mr Cummings told MPs. In an extraordinary attack, he accused the Health Secretary of lying to everybody on multiple occasions - including in the Cabinet room. He said he and Mark Sedwill, the Cabinet Secretary, had both personally urged the Prime Minister to sack Mr Hancock after he “performed far, far disastrously below the standards the country has a right to expect”. He said the “lies” included claiming everyone had got the treatment they needed in the first wave, despite being “explicitly told” that was untrue and “many people were left to die in horric circumstances”. They also included telling Cabinet “everything is fine on PPE, we’ve got it all covered”, before then blaming blockages on the Chancellor and NHS chief Simon Stevens. Mr Cummings said he asked Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill to investigate Mr Hancock’s blame claims, but “the Cabinet Secretary came back to me and said ‘it’s completely untrue, I have lost confidence in the Secretary of State’s honesty in these meetings.’”  No today insisted Boris Johnson has full confidence in his Health Secretary but refused to comment on specic claims. Mr Hancockaposs team said they reject Mr Cummingsapos claims, but didnapost specy which ones exactly. A spokesman for Mr Hancock said: “We absolutely reject Mr. Cummingsapos claims about the Health Secretary. “The Health Secretary will continue to work closely with the Prime Minister to deliver the vaccine rollout, tackle the risks posed by iants and support the NHS and social care sector to recover from this pandemic.” No were distracted because Donald Trump wanted Britain to bomb IraqMr Cummings said March  was the most “surreal” day of his time in government. Just as he was waking up to the danger of No’s “delay the peak” plan, he claimed, “suddenly the national security people came in and said Trump wants us to join a bombing campaign in the Middle East tonight. “And we need to start having meetings about that through the day with COBRA as well. “So everything to do with COBRA that day on Covid was completely disrupted.” He added: “Fortunately, thank God, the attorney general persuaded the PM not to go along with the whole bombing campaign.”Carrie Symonds demanded No staff ert their time to concentrate on her dogMr Cummings went on: “And then to add, it sounds so surreal it couldn’t possibly be true, that day the Times had run a huge story about the Prime Minister and his girlfriend and their dog. “And the Prime Minister’s girlfriend was going completely crackers about this story.and demanding that the press office deal with that. “So we had this sort of completely insane situation in which part of the building was saying are we going to bomb Iraq, part of the building was arguing about whether or not we’re going to do quarantine or not, the Prime Minister has his girlfriend going crackers about something completely trivial, and you have all these meetings going on through the course of the th.”  He accused Carrie Symonds of ‘illegal’ actsMr Cummings, who eventually quit in November, said: ”My resignation was definitely connected to the fact that the Prime Ministeraposs girlfriend was trying to change a whole bunch of dferent appointments in No and appoint her friends to particular jobs. In particular she was trying to overturn the outcome of an official process about hiring a particular job in a way which was not only completely unethical but was also clearly illegal. I thought the whole process about how the Prime Minister was behaving at that point was appalling and all of that was definitely part of why I went.  He branded the PM ‘unfit for the job’Mr Cummings said the main reason was because his relationship with Boris Johnson was already finished by October. He said he blamed the PM for the second wave thanks to his flat refusal to lock down for a second time in September. He told MPs: Fundamentally I regarded him as unfit for the job. “I was trying to create a structure around him to try and stop what I thought were extremely bad decisions, and push other things through against his wishes.Cummings raised alarm over PM’s strategy -  days before lockdownMr Cummings said his “mounting panic” began on March  last year when he sent a text to a group including the PM. The next morning, at .am, he said he texted Mr Johnson: “We’ve got big problems coming. “The Cabinet Office is terryingly s***, no plans, totally behind the pace. “We must announce today not next week -you feel ill with cold or flu, stay home… We are looking at ,-, deaths between optimistic and pessimistic scenarios.”  He said he then sat down with his favoured experts at pm on March , when they “hit the total panic button” and told him “we’re heading for total and utter catastrophe, we need to have Plan B.” Yet he said he only then told Mr Johnson on March  - nine days before lockdown - “you are going to have to lock down”. He admitted this three-day gap was not good enough. “It was a huge failing of mine and I bitterly regret that I didn’t hit the emergency panic button earlier than I did,” he told MPs.There was simply no plan for lockdownMr Cummings said he told the PM on March : “There is no lockdown plan. It doesn’t exist. SAGE haven’t modelled it. [The Health Department] don’t have a plan. We are going to have to figure out and hack together a lockdown plan.” He said by March , when there was “pushback” about ordering people with coughs to stay at home, he believed “the system is basically delaying announcing all of these things because there’s not a proper plan in place.” Officials also dodged locking down because they thought the public wouldn’t accept it. But that was clearly “”, and he said he realised that when family members were texting pleading for information.Key people were off skiing when coronavirus took hold“The government itself and No was not operating on a war footing in February on this in any way, shape or form,” he said. “Lots of key people were literally skiing in the middle of February. It wasn’t until the last week of February that there was any sense of urgency, I would say.” Mr Cummings said claims about extensive preparations for a pandemic were ”basically completely hollow” and “we didn’t figure this out until the back end of February”.Boris Johnson’s refusal to lock down in September was a personal crusadeDominic Cummings rehearsed the well-known arguments that Boris Johnson refused pleas to lock down for a second time in September, only doing it from November .“He wasn’t taking any advice. He was making the decisions himself,” he said. “The Cabinet wasn’t involved...there wasn’t any formal Cabinet meeting to discuss it. Orthere was, it was a purely Potemkin exercise.” The PM had decided he was protecting the economy, and Mr Cummings said “we could not persuade him thatyou basically took the view of ‘let it rip’”, it would lead to an economic and health “disaster.” Mr Johnson later used the phrase “let it rip” as a catchphrase to showcase the kind of approach he would not take.The government was turning down ventilators in late March because prices were jacked upMr Cummings told MPs: “I think it was the day the PM tested positive… the th [of March] I think. “In that meeting we were told at the Cabinet table by officials that the Department of Health had been turning down ventilators because the price had been marked up. “It completely beggars belief that that sort of thing was happening.”No staff drew up a whiteboard asking who they couldn’t ‘save’Mr Cummings spent the days in the run-up to his appearance dripping information on his Twitter feed - including a photo of a whiteboard last March.He said the scribblings were the first sketch of a Plan B, PM study. One noticeable line at the bottom has caused a stir - where it said aposwho do we not save apos. aposNotapos has been underlined. Explaining the remark, Mr Cummings said “we were already partly over the clf” and it reflected the reality of the unfolding pandemic.  Cummings accused Hancock of ‘criminal behaviour’ over his ‘stupid target’Mr Cummings accused the Health Secretary of criminal, disgraceful interference with the Test and Trace scheme to meet a stupid testing target of , per day. Mr Cummings told MPs: In my opinion, disastrously, [Matt Hancock] had made - while the PM was on his near deathbed - this pledge to do , [tests a day] by the end of April. This was an incredibly stupid thing to do because we already that goal internally. When he ed to work after having Covid himself, Mr Cummings said he started receiving calls from people who said: Hancock is interfering with the building of the Test and Trace system because heaposs telling everybody what to do to maximise his chances of hitting his stupid target by the end of the month. He added: In my opinion he shouldaposve been fired for that thing alone. That itself meant the whole of April was hugely disrupted by dferent parts of Whitehall fundamentally trying to operate in dferent ways completely because Hancock wanted to be able to go on TV and say aposlook at me and my k targetapos. It was criminal, disgraceful behaviour that caused serious harm.Cummings thought about quitting and going on TV to accuse PM of killing thousands The ex-aide said he should have resigned much earlier, and “I thought about it in March. “If we hadn’t successfully bounced things in March  I had talked to ious people during that week about saying to him that I will resign and hold a press conference and say the government’s going to kill hundreds of thousands of people. “I had similar conversations with people in September.” In the end, though, he quit in what critics say is a childish power struggle over who pulled the strings at No.‘Thousands’ of people would do a better job than ‘donkey’ Prime MinisterMr Cummings said it was “crackers” that either he or Boris Johnson had their jobs, “thousands” of Brits could do it better, and hero nurses were “lions led by donkeys”.He added: “There’s a very profound question about the nature of our political system that means we got at the last election a choice between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson.“I think any system which ends up giving a choice between two people like that to lead is obviously a system that’s gone extremely badly wrong.” He added: “In any sensible rational government it is completely crazy that I should have been in such a senior position in my personal opinion. “I’m not smart. I’ve not built great things in the world. It’s completely crackers that someone like me should have been in there, just as it’s crackers that Boris was in there and the choice at the last election was Jeremy Corbyn.” “The problem in this crisis was very much lions led by donkeys over and over again.”  The PM DID say ‘let the bodies pile high’Boris Johnson DID make infamous comments about ‘bodies piling high’, Dominic Cummings declared. He said he heard the Prime Minister make the remarks, originally reported as “no more f*****g lockdowns – let the bodies pile high in their thousands”, in the PM’s study shortly after his decision to implement a second lockdown on  October . That raises serious questions over Boris Johnsonaposs honesty. The PM has denied on the record and to Parliament that he made the remarks, saying the claims were “total, total rubbish”. There was a version of it in the Sunday Times, which was not accurate. But the version that the BBC reported was accurate, Mr Cummings said. I heard that in the Prime Ministeraposs study. That was not in September though, that was immediately after he finally made the decision to do the lockdown on October .Boris Johnson wanted to be like the mayor in Jaws - with no border controlsMr Cummings said he had a fractious meeting with the PM in July  when he flat refused to introduce border controls to stop a second wave. He said: He added: “He had the Dailywith their stupid campaign on the whole subject, he had Tory MPs going crackers about it at the same time. “And essentially at that point he was in ‘we should never have done lockdown, I should have been the mayor of Jaws [who kept the beaches open], now I’m going to be, open everything up, get on with it’. “And me and others just could not win that argument.  “We never won the argument - as of today. Look at the whole thing about iants. We still don’t have a proper border policy.” No said it would “obviously refute” that the border policy was too weak now, saying: “We have some of the toughest border measures in the world and we have taken action whenever necessary to keep the public safe.Boris Johnson ranted that the first lockdown should never have happenedHe also explosively claimed the PM ranted “we should never have done lockdown ” and any border control would ruin the travel industry. Mr Cummings went on: “To which of course some of us said, there’s not going to be a tourism industry in the Autumnwe have a second wave.’ The whole logic is completely wrong. “There was just no fundamentally good logic to not shutting the borders in January in my opinion and there was never any logic to it after April.”Boris Johnson is a ’disaster zone’ who changes his mind constantly like a ‘shopping trolley’In a blistering personal attack, he said Mr Johnson “made some terrible decisions and got things wrong and then constantly U-turned on everything” Mr Cummings told MPs: “The reason for all these problems was bad policy, bad decisions, bad planning, bad operational capability. “It doesn’t matteryou’ve got great people doing communicationsthe Prime Minister changes his mind  times a day and then calls up the media and contradicts his own policy day after day. “You’re going to have a communications disaster zone.” He added: “You cannot keep changing your mind every time thewrites an editorial on the subject… nobody could find a way around the problem of the PM like a shopping trolley smashing from one side of the island to the other.” The PM ‘laughed’ and said chaos is good because it makes him look more powerfulIn his summer  conversation with the PM, Mr Cummings claimed he said: “This whole system is chaos, this building is chaos, You are more frightened of me having the power to stop the chaos than you are afraid of the chaos.” He told MPs: “The PM laughed and said ‘you’re right, I am more frightened of you having the power to stop the chaos than I am of the chaos. ‘Chaos isn’t that bad. Chaos means everyone has to look to me to see who’s in charge.’”‘Stupid’ Boris Johnson personally decided to ‘pick a fight’ with Marcus RashfordThe “stupid” PM personally decided to defy footballer Marcus Rashford’s plea for free school meals over half term, against aides’ advice, he said. Mr Cummings told MPs: “The Director of Communications said to the PM twice ‘do not pick a fight with Rashford, obviously we should do this instead’. “The PM decided to pick a fight and then surrendered twice. “After that everyone says ‘your communications are stupid’ - what’s stupid is picking a fight with Rashford over school meals and what should have happened is just getting the school meals policy right.” People in government thought Covid was over and done with last summerMr Cummings said: “From the summer fundamentally the view was ‘we’re past it now, Covid is history’ - which was a terrible, terrible mistake.” Yet curiously he avoided criticising Rishi Sunak, the architect of the ill-fated ‘Eat out to Help Out’ scheme.Cummings just couldn’t help referring to filmsAt one point he told MPs: “You know that Spiderman meme with both Spidermans pointing at each other  It’s like that, but with everybody.” At another he said: “This is like a scene from Independence Day with Jeff Goldblum saying the aliens are here and your whole plan is broken and you need a new plan.” Covid- Bereaved Families For Justice, set up in the wake of the pandemic, blasted Mr Cummings saying: That this information is being unveiled in a pantomime-style spat between Cummings and Johnson, littered with independence day, Jeff Goldblum and spiderman references, is utterly inappropriate and makes this even more appalling.”Boris Johnson slammed for ‘terrible’ decision to delay Covid inquiry Boris Johnson today angrily rejected Labour ’s demand to bring forward a Covid inquiry to this summer, saying: “No! As I’ve said before I’m not going to concentrate valuable official time on that now while we’re still battling a pandemic.”But Mr Cummings said: “I think the idea that a serious inquiry, a lessons learned, doesnapost start until next year is completely terrible. “The families... tens of thousands of people died who didnapost need to die. Thereaposs absolutely no excuse for delaying that. “Because a lot of the reasons for why that happened are still in place now. Look at the whole debate about iants and what not. This has to be honestly explained.” He added: “If Number  today wonapost tell the truth about the official [herd immunity] plan which they briefed the media about and explained on TV a year ago, what on earth  is going on in there now ”Cummings finally admits his lockdown trip undermined public trustDominic Cummings admitted the debacle over his March  lockdown road trip “undermined public confidence” in the government. The former aide “deeply apologised” for the way he presented his farcical press conference in the No rose garden. Mr Cummings said “that whole episode was definitely a major disaster for the government and for the Covid policy.” He added: “I know that my misjudgement caused huge trouble. I deeply apologise for it.”But he refuses to apologise for his -mile road trip last March However, Mr Cummings refused to apologise for his actions - instead revealing he “couldn’t tell the whole story” last year about why he drove  miles in a national lockdown to Durham. He told MPs he had already discussed moving his family out of their London home due to security threats, including a few days before he fell ill with Covid. Around March , he said, he said to his we: “We’ve been discussing it for months - we’ve got to get out of here on Friday”.  For that reason, he said, he decided to “stonewall” the Mirror’s story before U-turning and giving a press conference three days later in the No rose garden, due to demands from Boris Johnson. But he decided not to go into any detail about the security threats because he was still in government. He told MPs: “I ended up giving the whole rose garden thing where what I said was true, but we left out a crucial part of it all. The whole thing was a complete disaster. It undermined public confidence in the whole thing.”Cummings wanted a ‘dictator’ as Prime MinisterOne of the most revealing quotes about his personality, Mr Cummings said: “In a well-run entity what would have happened is, essentially in my opinion, you would have had a kind of dictator in charge of this. “If I’d been Prime Minister I would have said [data expert] Marc Warner is in charge of this whole thing. “He speaks with my authority. He has as close to kingly authority as the state has legally to do stuff, and pushing the barriers of legality.”And to sum it all up… Cummings was branded a ‘disingenuous little f*****’MP Paul Bristow quoted to Mr Cummings an anonymous No claim that heaposs a disingenuous little f*****”. He was actually distracted in mid-February by his ambitions to put Cummings acolytes in every post of power”, the MP suggested. Mr Cummings insisted most stories about his dealings with the civil service were “% nonsense”. But it’s true that large parts of the hearing were eaten up by Mr Cummings talking about his own self-importance and sense of right. One y argument was over whether he did or didn’t retrospectively edit his blog to insert a warning about Covid.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBoris JohnsonCabinetNHSCare homesCivil servantsPoliticsCoronavirusDominic Cummings"},{"url":null,"title":"matt hancock hold press conference","story":"NewsMatt Hancock to hold press conference after vicious attack from Dominic CummingsThe Health Secretary is set to lead a Covid press conference on Thursday afternoon - after Boris Johnsons former top aide branded him \"disgraceful” - and potentially “criminal”mirrorShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video dominic-cummings-mounts-blistering-attack-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:MNfiVcq,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy notice Matt Hancock is to hold a press conference on Thursday afternoon, after coming under sustained attack from former colleague Dominic Cummings.Itaposs understood the Health Secretary will lead a Covid briefing from Downing Street, after Boris Johnsonaposs former top aide attacked his disastrous handling of the Covid- pandemic.Mr Cummings said he had repeatedly called for Mr Hancock to be sacked over coronavirus failings and criminal, disgraceful behaviour on the testing target.And he claimed Whitehallaposs top official recommended to the Prime Minister that Mr Hancock should be sacked.Downing Street did not deny that the Prime Minister considered sacking Mr Hancock in April last year but insisted Boris Johnson has confidence in him now, as the Health Secretary disputed the allegations.Mr Cummings said there were around  reasons why Mr Hancock should have been thrown out of the Cabinet - including, he claimed, lying both in meetings and publicly. Mr Hancock used chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty and chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance as shields to blame for his failures, Mr Cummings claimed.  He said Mr Hancock performed disastrously below the standards expected and the cabinet secretary - the countryaposs top civil servant - recommended the Health Secretary should be sacked.Mr Cummings said that while Donald Trump was ordering the CIA to gazump rival countries on orders for personal protective equipment , the Department of Health and Social Carewas still trying to get orders from China by ship.I think the Secretary of State for Health shouldaposve been fired for at least ,  things, including lying to everybody on multiple occasions in meeting after meeting in the Cabinet room and publicly, Mr Cummings said. Thereaposs no doubt at all that many senior people performed far, far disastrously below the standards which the country has a right to expect. I think the Secretary of State for Health is certainly one of those people. I said repeatedly to the Prime Minister that he should be fired, so did the cabinet secretary, so did many other senior people.  Sir Mark Sedwill was the cabinet secretary until September , a period which covered the first phase of the pandemic. We absolutely reject Mr Cummingsapos claims about the Health Secretary, a spokesman for Mr Hancock said. The Health Secretary will continue to work closely with the Prime Minister to deliver the vaccine rollout, tackle the risks posed by iants and support the NHS and social care sector to recover from this pandemic. He insisted the Health Secretary had worked incredibly hard in unprecedented circumstances to protect the NHS and save lives. Mr Hancock will appear before the same committee where the series of hard-hitting allegations were levelled on June .  Mr Cummings has previously described Mr Hancockaposs department as a smoking ruin which could not cope with the demands of the pandemic. There were lots of great people in it but the procurement system which they were operating was just completely hopeless, he added on Wednesday. There wasnapost any system set up to deal with proper emergency procurement. At a meeting on March , Mr Cummings said he was told by officials that the DHSC had been turning down ventilators because the price had been marked up - it completely beggars belief that sort of thing was happening. On PPE, Mr Cummings said he was told in meetings that vital masks and gloves were being sent by sea because it is what we always do.  Mr Cummings said: Hang on, we are going to have a peak in the NHS around about mid-April, and you are shipping things from China that are going to arrive in monthsapos time and all the aeroplanes are not flying  Leave this meeting, commandeer the planes, fly them to China, drop them at the nearest airfield, pick up our stuff, fly it back. At this point you had Trump sending the CIA round trying to gazump everybody on PPE. The whole system was just like wading through treacle. He added that the cabinet secretary said the Government had to vy up the Health Secretaryaposs job because there were multiple huge things here that were all being dropped. On the claim that Mr Hancock lied, Mr Cummings said: There are numerous examples. In the summer he said that everybody who needed treatment got the treatment they required. He knew that that was a lie because he had been briefed by the chief scientic adviser and the chief medical officer himself about the first peak. We were told explicitly people did not get the treatment they deserved, many people were left to die in horric circumstances. Mr Hancock had also blamed NHS chief Sir Simon Stevens and Chancellor Rishi Sunak for PPE problems.Mr Cummings said he asked the cabinet secretary to investigate, who came back and said it is completely untrue, I have lost confidence in the Secretary of Stateaposs honesty in these meetings. The former aide said Mr Hancockaposs public promise to deliver , tests a day by the end of April was incredibly stupid because it was already an internal goal. In my opinion he shouldaposve been fired for that thing alone, and that itself meant the whole of April was hugely disrupted by dferent parts of Whitehall fundamentally trying to operate in dferent ways completely because Hancock wanted to be able to go on TV and say aposlook at me and my k targetapos. It was criminal, disgraceful behaviour that caused serious harm. Accusing Mr Hancock of appalling behaviour towards Prof Whitty and Sir Patrick, Mr Cummings said: He used the whole aposweaposre following the scienceapos as a way so that he could always say, aposwellthings go wrong, weaposll blame the scientists and itaposs not my faultapos. He suggested Mr Johnson kept Mr Hancock in place because he was told you should keep him there because heaposs the person you fire when the inquiry comes along. At Prime Ministeraposs Questions, Mr Johnson was asked whether the cabinet secretary had lost faith in the Health Secretaryaposs honesty. Mr Johnson said: The answer to that is aposnoapos and Iaposm afraid I havenapost had the benefit of seeing the evidence that he is bringing to the House, but I must say that I think what the people of this country want us all to do is to get on with the delicate business now of trying to reopen our economy and restore peopleaposs freedoms, get back to our way of le by rolling out the vaccine. PressedMr Johnson still has confidence in the Health Secretary, the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: Yes, the Health Secretary has been working closely with the Prime Minister throughout and has been fully focused on protecting the health and care system and saving lives.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCabinetCentral Intelligence AgencyNHSDonald TrumpBoris JohnsonCare homesCivil servantsNursing homesPoliticsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"before after snaps show hoarders","story":"NewsBefore and after snaps show hoarders homes filled with old food, dust balls and dead ratsChloe Wright, from Frome, Somerset, helps people clear out their cluttered homes - and the results of her work are incredible and often le-changing for her clientsmirrorShareCommentsByCarol DriverZoe ForseyFeatures Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsChloe transforms properties from clutter nightmares to tidy and organised homes \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

While her job is far from glamorous, what she does makes a huge dference to the lives of the people she helps - many of whom have mental health issues. The -year-old, from Frome, Somerset, who runs Goddess Organising, is known for her spotless homes and meticulous organisational skills and is called in to overhaul master bedrooms, kitchens and garages - but sheaposs also been asked to tackle teenagersapos messy bedrooms. She said: “Ninety percent of my clients admit to having postnatal depression, ADHD or mental health problems, anxiety or stress, and that’s why their homes are the way they are, because they can’t face tidying it, while copying with kids, work and stress, then it becomes so big, that it’s too overwhelming.  “What I do isn’t a luxury - it’s a necessity for people.

It’s an emergency service, it’s for people who really need it to make themselves feel better. “I also work with self-employed people who are too busy to worry about how messy the garage is, full-time working single parents who are struggling to juggle work, kids and le, and many others. “People often feel embarrassed they need to hire an organiser. That’s why I post before and after pictures, to show people they’re not alone. “I offer decluttering tips and le hacks to help clients keep their homes organised, clutter-free and a peaceful haven for them and their families. “Every story is dferent.

Chloe started her business three years as she needed to make some extra cash but wanted a job that would fit around her young son.  Now, her prices start at £ a day depending on the job. She said: “I do come up against a lot of mouldy food, huge dust balls like you wouldn’t believe, dead rodents and funnily enough sex toys. Chloe says her job is all about clearing out the rubbish to make room for the loved, used and needed. “Once a room is decluttered, I can be left to organise it into a more logical fashion.  “I will deep clean each area ready for the new items to find their permanent homes. And then it’s onto the fun bit, the unveiling of the room to the client. This is usually where I get cried on! “I have been described as a whirlwind, superwoman and the obvious one, a true goddess.” The super-organiser says although she doesn’t have counselling training, her clients confide in her, so she helps them to process their feelings and encourages them to say goodbye to some beloved items.  Chloe added: “For most people, being locked down in homes that suppressed them and increased their already stressed minds became the tipping point.” Soon Chloe’s clients started sharing their stories of how she changed their homes and mentally lted a huge weight of their shoulders. Chloe said: “On our initial contact, my customers are shy, withdrawn and apologetic. They feel the need to justy why they need my help. “We all need help with something in our lives after all. I also get cried on a lot.  “Having a stranger arrive who won’t judge, who is solely there to help and promises to make everything go away, tends to open the flood gates of desperation, relief and gratitude. “So many clients cry when I say it is doable. For them to know that someone is going to come in and take over is massive. “To know that tomorrow all the clutter will be gone and left in a more logical and clean organised way is le changing.”  But Chloe says her decluttering plan only worksthe client is completely on board with the process. She explains: “Most average size and cluttered rooms take a day to do. I do have one client whose house may take the rest of the year. “So far, each bedroom has taken two-and-a-half days to complete - and the entire large three-bedroom house is filled with stuff. “I usually have the clients work alongside me as I need them to have an input in the decision making of what stays and what goes. “By touching each item they either feel emotions or they don’t and they soon recognise the items that mean a lot to them and the ones that are just clutter. “The physical and mental energy that is involved in a day’s decluttering is exhausting for all so the idea of having to do this again is off putting enough not to creep stuff back to their lives.” But one of the most important parts of Chloe’s home overhauls is talking to clients about the importance of changing their mindset, so they do not slip back into old habits. Chloeaposs decluttering tipsOpen your curtains and make your bed as soon as you get up in the morning. Only keep what is needed, loved and useful. Everything should have a “home” and put it back into its “home” straight away. Do it straight away.Make every minute count. Avoid bulk buying. Buy something new, get rid of something old.Group like-for-like items togetherDo your weekly shop online. This way you won’t buy “just incase” and you wonapost be tempted by the in-store offers so you’ll save money too. Keep the top of wardrobes and cupboards clear - anything above head height creates a heavy, suppressive and dark feeling when you enter.To clean and clear in bite-size pieces, breaking down each job into manageable sections.

The organisations are “very worried” about the public’s safety and are urging people to choose beaches that have leguards.  Of the roughly  bathing beaches, only  have leguards. Gareth Morrison, the RNLI’s head of water safety, said: “We are expecting this summer to be the busiest ever for our leguards and volunteer leboat crews. This is very concerning. Our main advice is to visit a leguarded beach and swim between the red and yellow flags.” He added: “In a normal year, around  people lose their lives accidentally at the coast... With it starting to warm up we are expecting a vast influx to the beach and the coast. “People have been cooped up for so long and... history tells us the more people who go to the beach, unfortunately the more drowning we will see.” In , RNLI leguards saved  lives and helped over , people.

At home in Morecambe, Lancashire, the family gets through  pints of milk and four loaves of bread a day, as well as  toilet rolls, three tubes of toothpaste and  yoghurts a week. Noel and Sue admit the last year has been chaotic and challenging. “You do feel like you are going a bit crazy because there are so many in the house,” Sue told The Mirror earlier this year. “The weather has been awful recently so there isn’t a lot you can do. You can’t escape either, as there is not a quiet place at home.” But the big day out brought a breath of fresh air and Sue told the Daily Star it had been an absolute treat.The Radfords had their work cut out trying to match the kidsapos energy – but said the children loved it and were completely knackered by the end.

Name AV., the latest iant has been detected mostly in Yorkshire and the Humber, but also in a couple of other places across the world. Public Health England scientists have found the strain has  mutations,  of which are in the spike protein. As in the Indian iant, these natural alterations make the strain more infectious and render the vaccine less effective. PHE has been monitoring the iant since April and has classed it one step below the Indian strain, which is a Variant of Concern.  Dr Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, told the Andrew Marr Show: It is a iant under investigation - that means it has been spotted to have particular mutations that can be associated with adverse outcomes. So it might be more susceptible to being more transmissible or counter some of the immune response that we would normally produce. She added that there hasnapost been any signal that there have been any particular problems from the tests carried out so far. Dr Harries confirmed that there have been  cases mostly focused around Yorkshire and the Humber but that there had also been some spotted in a couple of other places across the world. That number, which was correct up to May , has now doubled to , according to data from the Covid- Genomics UK Consortium. A scientic paper shows the characteristics of the iant for the first time, with swabs having been taken from people in its epicentre of Sheffield. Prof Lawrence Young, a virologist and professor of molecular oncology at the University of Warwick, told The Sun that some of the strains mutations are associated with immune escape and with increased transmissibility”. He added: “The good news is thatvaccines work against all the iants albeit with reduced efficiency in some cases.“This all shows that we are not out of the woods and test and trace is more important than ever.” Simon Clarke, an associate professor in cellular microbiology, University of Reading, said the mutations suggestions the iant had some kind of advantage, but the effects of most of them were currently unknown.  Paul Hunter, professor of medicine, University of East Anglia said the Yorkshire Variant could “rapidly increase in numbers, become the dominant iant and push up hospitalisations”, or could simply fade away. Various Covid- strains have been identied in the UK since the beginning of the pandemic last year, with the Kent iant becoming a dominant strain before the Indian iant began to surpass it. Dr Harries urged people to continued to follow social distancing rules to suppress the virusapos spread and to stop the Indian Variant running rampant in less impacted parts of the country. She said: “It’s a bit of a mixed picture across the country.  “If you look at areas such as Bolton and Bedford, for example, in the north-west particularly, itis starting to become the dominant strain and has taken over from the Kent iant, which has been our predominant one over the winter months. “But that’s not the case right across the country, actuallyyou’re in the south-west that’s still not the case.” She said: All of these iants under investigation are there for us to keep monitoring them, just as we have the ones that have progressed to a iant of concern.She also said the possibility of lting all coronavirus restrictions next month is “looking good” but urged caution to avoid another lockdown.“It’s looking goodpeople are continuing to observe all of the safety signals, so we should not stop doing what we’re doing, particularly in areas where we have that iant of concern, the B., in the north-west and around London. “It’s really important that people continue to do hands, face, space and work from home, have their jabs and go for tests as well. “The cases of the B. iant are rising, they have risen very steeply and much of the media have reported a % rise in cases over the week period but they seem to be slightly levelling at the moment. “It’s still very early days.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnUniversity of East AngliaUniversity of ReadingUniversity of WarwickCoronavirusMutant Coronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"covid rules changes indoors pubs","story":"AdvertorialWhat you can and cant do under new government Covid rulesRestrictions have eased this week in England, which means emotional reunions for many people – but we still need to follow the rules to protect our loved onesmirrorShareByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY AdvertorialFamilies across England are reuniting as lockdown restrictions ease and indoor hospitality is once again open, including cinemas, pubs and concert venues. It’s the first time since  that people from dferent households have been allowed to meet indoors. Now, they can mix inside in groups of six – or two households – and celebrations such as weddings and christenings in Covid-secure settings are permitted, with up to  people. But the virus is still out there with one in three people showing no symptoms, so regular rapid testing and following the Hands, Face, Space, Fresh Air guidance will help us all stay safe and stop the spread. Meeting outdoors is always the safest option, andyou do go indoors stick to the rule of six or two households. Here’s what you need to know to follow the rules and stay safe... I can’t wait to hug my parents. Is that permitted now   Yes, you can now have close contact with family and friends – including hugs. Use caution and common sense and think about the risk of catching or passing on the virus, which spreads mainly among people who are in close contact . I’d love a minibreak. Can I stay overnight with friends now  Yes. Hotels, BBs and hostels are now open, so overnight stays are permitted for groups of up to six, or two households. I’m sick of doing yoga on Zoom – can I go to a class in person   Yes, organised exercise classes, including those in gyms or yoga and Pilates can resume in a Covid-safe environment. Can I go to the cinema now  Yes. Indoor attractions and hospitality venues are open, including cinemas, restaurants, museums, theatres, bowling alleys and organised indoor sporting events.

Residents can now leave the home for a low-risk visit, such as a walk in the park, without then having to self-isolate for  days. I’m still unsure about mixing indoors. How can I stay safe  Go at your own pace and follow the rules. It’s safer to meet outsideyou can – and minimise close contact. If you do choose to meet indoors, open a window to ventilate and let fresh air in. Remember, some people are more vulnerable than others and exercise caution at all times. One in three people who have Covid- shows no symptoms, so get into a routine of taking two tests a week and isolatethe result is positive.

Jo - who doesnapost wish to disclose her last name - has blamed the shock death on the inexperience of her petaposs breeder. She came across an advert online for a litter of Cockapoo puppies on May  - with the breeder asking for nearly £, infor one of the pups. The then family picked up little Nala two days later and fell in love with the new addition to their family. But just a few days later, the dog came down with sickness and diarrhoea and was diagnosed with parvovirus - a highly contagious virus that is a common cause of young puppies dying.Got a story  Email webnews@mirror. And then, on May , after spending over £, on vets bills, the family had to make the heartbreaking decision to put Nala to sleep after vets had tried all possible resources. Jo, , explained: There isnapost a country wide policy when it comes to breeding dogs - you donapost need a license but in some areas you do and the breeder that we got our puppy from, should have had a license but he didnapost. The advert we found looked very professional and we fell in love with Nala as soon as we saw the picture of her. My daughter video called him before we put the deposit down and his house and garden looked really clean and the puppies all looked healthy. After picking her up, I realised the breeder didnapost even know my name. If I was selling puppies, I would want to do a full home check and very who they were rather than just give them to anyone. She was fine for the first three days but then she began going downhill and thataposs when we rushed her to the vet. There were several puppies in this litter and we know for definite that four of them have passed away from this virus itaposs likely they all had it and none of them had been health checked. All of Nalaaposs veterinary costs have gone onto a credit card which we will probably be paying back for the next three years but we had to try everything to save Nala’s le. There needs to be more laws around who can breed and more regulations.  We are all absolutely heartbroken - as soon as I held her I felt like she was my family and we only got to have her in our house for three days before she was taken to the vets. Jo, from Southampton, decided to get another pup after looking for a companion for her four-year-old Cavapoo. But with prices increasing throughout the pandemic, Jo ended up spending nearly £, on little Nala. She said: The demand for dogs has gone up massively and thataposs why we struggled to get a rescue dog. People have seen an opportunity to make money in the pandemic and theyaposve gone with it which is why there is so much irresponsible breeding going on and itaposs dangerous. If I wanted to breed a dog to make some extra cash, I could but I shouldnapost be able to. Jo claims the breeder she bought Nala from was unlicensed - despite allegedly needing a license to breed animals in his area. But despite this, Jo said there were no red flags when picking Nala up from the home just two days after finding the advert online. She added: The family were very nice and there were no red flags. I felt comfortable with the entire thing. As soon as we held her, we all fell in love with her. She had had her first vaccine so we had her second vaccine scheduled he told us she was eight-weeks-old but according to her vaccination card, she was ten-weeks-old. On Monday night we noticed she was quite lethargic but we put that down to the change of environment but the next morning, she was having diarrhoea and vomiting.  I text the breeder and he recommended we take her to the vets where we eventually found out she had parvo virus - the mortality rate is %. We had insurance but it doesnapost take effect for  days so it cost us £, all together to put her in critical care. If the breeder would have had insurance, we would have been covered. Her body was so frail and when I went to say goodbye to her, she already looked dead. We called him when we found out it was the virus and told him he must contact all the other buyers to let them know. You ultimately need to do your homework when buying a puppy - itaposs one of the most heartbreaking things we are going through as a family. When I close my eyes I can still see her gorgeous face. If I could wind back the clock, I probably wouldn’t because we gave Nala the most loving three days she could have wished for, butever wanted to explore the route again, I will definitely be doing more research on the breeder. I hope everyone who is considering breeding to do their homework, know their legal obligations and more importantly, do right my the animals.To find out more, visit www.justicefornalaFOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCredit cardsAnimals"},{"url":null,"title":"france imposes compulsory isolation brits","story":"NewsFrance imposes compulsory isolation on Brits amid Indian iant fearsThe move sees the country follow both Austria and Germany, who have implemented their own restrictions on the nation in recent days - although Spain is still welcoming BritsmirrorShareCommentsByJonathan ColesReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsBrits travelling to France face compulsory isolation \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Looking at the pictures, itaposs certainly worth the wait. Itaposs the latest venture for Nottingham entrepreneurs Dan Brown and Drew Hewitt, who run a number of quirkily decked out bars in the area as part of their Curious Venues group. Many of the wacky props were given to Dan over the years from reclamation yards, antique fairs and auctions. The whale was damaged goods so we got it from a guy down south and repaired it, said Dan. It is a place for adults and not for those easily offended but thereaposs nothing too bad.  The property was most recently Alt, a gaming bar, and before that an oriental buffet. The golf course includes a number of weird-looking holes, including the neon-lit Black Hole with a spaceman and aliens, the Meat Hole, where thereaposs a bloody scene to negotiate, and other holes too rude to mention. Then thereaposs the SkegVegas Hole, complete with a fruit machine, mobility scooter, Elvis, seagulls and the seaside townaposs famous Jolly Fisherman. Itaposs even better than I thought it would be. Having another six months allowed us to have more ideas to make it as fun as possible, Drew said. Itaposs perfect for hens and stags, date nights and friends. We are trying to make it as Covid-friendly as possible. We are limiting it to groups of four and there is adequate time before the next groups tee off so thereaposs no loitering at holes.  Cocktails and Ugly Bread Bakery pizzasare sold at the clubhouse, and the venue is also open to non-golfers looking for a quirky place to eat and drink. Itaposs decked out with booths, arcade games and air hockey. Oh, and Barack Obama sitting on a Chesterfield sofa.

If itaposs Charles, itaposs just crowning him, she continued. Butitaposs William, itaposs him and Kate. Camilla canapost be crowned because sheaposs a orcée. During its influential -year history, royally appointed needleworkers have produced all manner of royal gard from Queen Victoriaaposs funeral pall to the Robes of State for the Queen Mother in  and Queen Elizabeth in .  They embroidered slippers for Prince Charles and a monogrammed lace pillow for Princess Diana for their royal wedding. As part of the RSN, Ms Savage worked with the house of Alexander McQueen on the Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding outfit in , including her blue silk and white lace garter.She also worked on embroidery on Meghanaposs dress for her wedding to Prince Harry in . But the RSN has not had to work on coronation regalia since Queen Elizabeth II took the throne. The monarch had her fatheraposs robes shortened, mindful of the British publicaposs distaste for excess after the struggles of World War II. But the RSN will have to make new regalia when first-in-line Charles or heir William take the throne, Ms Savage said. Itaposs not easy to en anything, and now the robes are too delicate to be reused, she told Business Insider.The embroiderer has been outspoken during the pandemic, as she revealed she nearly went broke and feared losing home as business dried up during lockdown. Ahead of Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs big Budget unveiling in March, Ms Savage claimed she had received just £, from the Government as she highlighted how lockdowns had left wedding businesses facing ruin.She said: I did have a bit of support mostly from outside iniduals. A lovely lady set up a crowd funder which paid two months worth of rent, but we are still living on a hand-to-mouth, day-to-day basis.  Senior royals have in recent years been quietly preparing for succession plans.The Queen, , lost her beloved husband Prince Philip, , in April, and has weathered a stormy year of palace rts since Meghan and Harryaposs sensation split from royal le.Following the Duke of Edinburghaposs death, royal historian Robert Lacey spoke of how he had been aposcrucialapos in coaching his grandson for the role of King.Philip spent the final years of his le helping William, who is second in line for the throne after his father Charles, prepare for the role of his letime, Mr Lacey said.Philip was crucial in helping coach William as a future King, the author of the bestselling biography Battle of Brothers, told People. It was Philipaposs idea to set up the lunches between William and his grandmother. When the time came for the Queen to talk business with William, Philip would quietly excuse himself because he didnapost feel that the constitutional side of the Queenaposs job was something he wanted to interfere in.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMeghan MarkleKate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgeMarriageRoyal FamilyWeddingsPrince WilliamPrince Charles, Prince of WalesCamilla, Duchess of Cornwall"},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownmirrorShareByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Then at  I was diagnosed with MS. My partner has stuck by me and, about  years ago, we decided to try adoption.We were lucky to get two children, who were aged four and six when we took them on. But why do I still miss never having had my own  The children are really hard work and my partner and I hardly ever speak. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section He’s lucky because he goes out to work, but I was made ­redundant while going through the adoption process and we decided it might be easierI didn’t go back. I realise that the past  months have been hard on everyone, but even before Covid, my so-called friends disappeared. So I sit on my own every day, thinking. Coleen saysI know from a friend who adopted a toddler that it is not an easy option.You have to become so much more than a parent to cope with a child’s broken past, anger and attachment issues, and navigating school can be very challenging. I’m certain your children have brought you joy too, and I don’t think you should feel bad about mourning the loss of not having your own ­biological kids – I think that’s a pretty common feeling. While you’re focusing so much energy, attention and love on the children , it’s easy to forget about yourself and your relationship. But it’s so important to reconnect with your partner and redirect some of that love to yourselves. Make the time to talk to him and discuss what the two of you need. You sound like you feel isolated. You might have to force yourself to reach out to friends and get involved with le again. Once you do start engaging with people, it will feel less of an effort and you’ll feel better in every way.Andyou find yourself ­overthinking, take your mind ­somewhere  – a book, a podcast, a meditation app. Start focusing more on yourself.

Stephie Lehrle, from Stoke-on-Trent, says she saves the pennies by cooking large batches of nutritious meals in one go. She has also taught her son how to cook his own pasta pots at home – for a fraction of the price of food in the canteen. In total, the pair make  servings at a time with ingredients costing £.Previously, she would fork out as much as £ for a pasta pot at her sonaposs school. It means she is making a saving of £ every four weeks during term-time, as Stoke on Trent Live reports.  Stephie shared photos of her smiling boy cooking his lunch in their kitchen, and thousands of people praised their money-saving idea.Posting on Facebookaposs Family Lowdown Tips  Ideas group, Stephie wrote: So tonight teaching my son the art of batch cooking... As OUR school meals are not particularly nutritious or cost effective.Batch cooking is great for families who are busy or people that live alone. Nutritious food cooked just the way you like it, when you want it and a fraction of the price. Her post attracted more than , likes and , comments from other parents. Many praised her for teaching her son le skills. One said: What a fab idea! Not just for the cost but youaposre teaching your son le skills. Plus you have also spent quality time together. Another added: Brilliant idea and what a great mum for teaching your son not only how to cook but also how to get the most out of your money. Well done.  A third suggested Stephieaposs son should sell the pots at school for £ each and make a tidy profit. Batch cooking is a tried and tested way to save cash – and many parents swear by it.Among them is super-organised Donna Steed, , who has managed to slash £ off her shopping bill every week by packing her freezer with cooked meals.The busy Aberdeen mum cuts down on food costs by planning carefully and rustling up multiple meals at the same time. She went on a cooking blitz at the end of last year, spending a whole week preparing meals just before Christmas. She filled her standing freezer with  tubs of food. “I did a couple of dishes every other day to get the ball rolling, she said. “I tend to put one dish in the slow cooker, one on the hob and then one in the oven, then it didn’t feel as much of a chore. “It seems quite productive but it really doesn’t require that much effort. In the end, it only takes about an hour out of the day. She said the process has become quite addictive, adding: You feel like you’re being organised and efficient so it feels really good.

The Royal Geographical Society has come up with a list of Seven Wonders of Nature in the UK, bringing together all the beautul and unique geological sites Britainaposs nature has to offer. Pistyll Rhaeadr waterfallat Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant has made it onto the list of natural landmarks, a waterfall just inside the Welsh border and which at ft is thought to be one of Britainaposs highest. The majestic waterfall is made of streams originating in the Berwyn Mountains, falling in three stages to form the Afon Rhaeadr. It joined other top locations such as Loch Coruisk and the Cuillins, Wastwater, Dovedale, the Needles, the Jurassic Coast and the Giantaposs Causeway.What do you think of this selection of beauty spots  Let us know in the comments section below.However, a new survey commissioned as part of the project revealed a lack of knowledge of the UK’s most revered natural landmarks, the WalesOnline reports. A staggering  per cent of those polled admitted to not having heard of all the Seven Wonders. Survey results showed that  per cent of UK adults have incredibly never visited any of the Seven Wonder landmarks – with the Jurassic Coast being the most visitedand Pistyll Rhaeadr being the least visited . The survey, of , people, was commissioned by outdoor specialists Merrell ahead of the launch of its new MOAB footwear collection and revealed that more than half of UK adults are more likely to visit one the UK’s best beauty spots than they were pre-coronavirus. Results from the survey also suggests the pandemic has made the public more open to UK travel with  per cent stating they were more open to exploring unfamiliar places in the UK, more than they were before the pandemic. Television presenter Mary-Ann Ochota, a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society said: “One of the few positives to come out of the pandemic is the opportunity many of us have had to explore the natural wonders on our doorsteps. And hopefully this summer will offer even more chances to explore new places in the UK. This list will have a couple of sites that might be familiar, but there’s also likely to be some hidden gems that you might never have heard of. These seven locations are really extraordinary – I think most of us would be amazed to learn that they’re right here in our own country. Simon Sweeney, UK marketing manager at Merrell, said: “The Natural Wonders have been devised to inspire native exploration and celebrate nature’s greatest gts in the UK. The other six Natural Wonders of the UK  Wastwater, Lake District Surrounded by some of the Lake District’s tallest mountains, Wastwater lies in one of the wildest and most dramatic valleys of the National Park. The valley of Wasdale was created by Ice Age glaciers carving out U-shaped hollows in the hard volcanic rocks. Although the Ice Age began about . million years ago, it was the latest period o f intense cold, about , years ago, that caused the striking features seen today in the Lake District.  Giant’s Causeway, Northern Ireland The Giant’s Causeway lies on the coast of County Antrim in Northern Ireland. The area was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in  due to it being ‘a spectacular area of global geological importance.” The geological features of the Causeway were formed around - million years ago, when the Antrim Coast was subjected to intense volcanic activity. The most characteristic and unique feature of the site is the regular polygonal basalt columns - estimates suggest that there are approximately , columns around the Causeway.  Dovedale, Peak District Located in the Peak District, Dovedale is a stretch of the Dove Valley where the Dove River tumbles through impressive limestone ravines. The limestone rock of Dovedale and the wider Peak District consists of the fossilised remains of marine le from the Carbonerous period,  million years ago when the area was underneath a shallow tropical sea. At the end of the Ice Age, vast quantities of meltwater cut through the layers of limestone leaving behind the limestone rock formations like those found in Dovedale.  The Needles, Isle of Wight The Needles form the western tip of a backbone of chalk that crosses the centre of the Isle of Wight, with three distinctive, jagged, chalk stacks that extend into the sea. However, the fourth and taller, needle-like stack that gave its name to these rocks, known as ‘Lot’s Weapos, collapsed during a storm in .  Jurassic Coast, Dorset Designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in  due to the global importance of its rocks, fossils and geological landforms, the Jurassic Coast is a -mile stretch of coast from Orcombe Point in Exmouth, Devon to the Old Harry Rocks, near Swanage in Dorset. The site provides an almost continuous sequence of rock formations covering the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods, known collectively as the Mesozoic Era, and is internationally renowned for its contribution to the study of earth sciences over the past  years.  Loch Coruisk  the Cuillins Loch Coruisk, meaning ‘Cauldron of Waters’ in Scottish Gaelic, is an in-land, freshwater loch situated in the heart of the Cuillins on the Isle of Skye. Whilst the head of the loch is surrounded on three sides by the imposing volcanic Black Cuillins, the southern end connects to the sea by the Scavaig River which discharges into Loch Scavaig. Following a visit to Dunvegan Castle, Sir Walter Scott visited Loch Coruisk in , describing it as that dread lake in his poem ‘The Lord of the Isles’.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnUnited Nations Educational, Scientic, and Cultural OrganizationRoyal FamilyWaterfallsCoronavirusNatural wonders"},{"url":null,"title":"teacher ordered schoolgirls wash pro","story":"NewsTeacher ordered schoolgirls to wash pro-Palestine messages off their handsHundreds of people have signed a petition calling for the staff member at de Ferrers Academy to be sacked in the alleged row over the students support for PalestinemirrorShareCommentsByMirror:,  MAY NewsThe de Ferrers Academy, in Harehedge Lane \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

However, one woman has found a genius yet simple hack for getting a flat, toned tum, without even having to stand up, let alone going to the gym. It really does sound too good to be true.Dance teacher Tracey-Ann Roman took to TikTok to share a class she had found for working the torso from the comfort of your own chair.“I am going to teach you how to get a stomach that is thin and trim, with no sit-ups and no gym, a voice in the background could be heard saying, while Tracey-Ann sat in the chair ready to demonstrate the moves. “We are going to work the transversus abdominis muscle. The deep core muscle way underneath that supports the pelvis and supports the organs and will help you prevent lower back problems. The voice went on to say that you start by sitting up straight and holding your arms in the air for one to two minutes, and you will feel these muscles start to contract. “The second phase, the voice added,  repetitions and bring your knee up nice and slowly and you will continue to work that core.” Next, the voice could be heard telling Tracey-Ann to sit on the end of her chair, with her arms straight up in the air, before moving her body forward to pivot, contract and then come back. Pivot from the hips, come back, it said. “Every time you go forward, squeeze those abs. Youaposre going to do  repetitions. So do those daily and your stomach will love you.” One TikTok user commented by pointing out that no matter how much exercise you do, a huge proportion of it comes down to having a healthy diet. But remember, Tracey-Ann responded, when you start to build muscle, you burn fat faster and will start to lose inches - but yes, course you have to eat healthy too.

Not exactly ideal. But was it actually possible for them to avoid this and get the sofa into the flat  Flatshare site SpareRoom have used maths to reveal that, yes, it would have been possible -only theyaposd been sure to TILT as well as PIVOT.By analysing the iconic scene in meticulous detail and estimating the dimensions of the stairs and the couchSpareRoom and data science consultant Caroline Zunckel PhD have produced an equation and methodology explaining how Ross could have moved the couch into his flat. According to the in-depth workings and diagrams, the mathematical solution would have saved Ross hundreds of pounds. The findings might even come in useful for real-le flatmates in a similar situation to Ross,they’re mathematically inclined, that is.  So how should it have been done ! The killer equation Ross needed to get his couch around the corner and up the stairs: Angle of vertical tilt. -.xWS+ .xWC+ .xLCStep : First Ross should have measured the width of the stairs WS , and the width WCandLCof the couch.Step : Ross then should have used the equation to find out the minimum angle Tthat the couch would need to be tilted upwards to move around the -degree corner of the stairwell.Step : After carrying the couch to the corner Ross, Rachel and Chandler reach a point where they can’t move any more. When this happens Ross, Rachel and Chandler should have rested the couch against the corner.Step : Here the friends should have tilted the couch vertically towards the ceiling until the angle between the stairs and the base of the couch was greater than or equal to T . At this point the verticalof the couch would be smaller than the horizontaland they should have been able to successfully pivot the couch round the corner without it getting stuck.Step : Once round the corner Ross, Rachel and Chandler should have moved the couch back to its original orientation and the carried it up to the flat. Caroline Zunckel commented: By applying Pythagoras’ theorem to the estimated measurements of Ross’s sofa in a vertical position and dimensions of the stairwell, I was able to establish that it would have been possible for Ross to get the sofa up the stairwell and into the flat without resorting to the extreme measure of chopping it in half. It’s quite simple really! Matt Hutchinson, SpareRoom Director added: We know moving new furniture into a flat can be challenging. Ross isn’t the only one to end up with his couch stuck in a stairwell or corridor. Although the research contains some headache-inducing maths, the solution for Ross is pretty simple: ‘pivot’ and ‘tilt’ - and take a little time to measure up before you buy any furniture.

It comes as three people were arrested by Italian police in an investigation into the fatal incident.Five-year-old Eitan Biran, from Israel, was the only survivor of the crash that killed  people.According to Italian newspaper La Stampa, young Eitan is reported to have asked Whereaposs mum  upon his arrival in hospital in Turin, Italy, before he was placed into a medically induced coma.Victims of the crash include both his parents, Amit Biran, , and Tal Peleg-Biran, , and Eitanaposs two-year-old brother Tom.  Talaposs grandparents Barbara, , and Yitzhak Cohen, , also died in the crash. In a haunting final photo taken moments before the crash, Eitan can be seen looking out the window of the cable car in northern Italy, standing next to his great-grandfather, moments before the crash, according to The Sun. The cable car was travelling from Stresa, on Lake Maggiore, to Mottarone mountain in Italyaposs Alps. Investigators said on Monday their initial probe into the disaster would look into how the lead cable snapped and why a safety brake mechanism failed to activate. The cable car was approaching a station on top of the ,ft Mottarone mountain when it plunged, rolled down the steep terrain and crashed into trees. It is believed the lead cable tragically snapped as it approached its final stop in the -minute trip. Italian prosecutors have opened an investigation into suspected involuntary manslaughter and negligence. Public prosecutor Olimpia Bossi said: We are starting from the empirical evidence. The cable sheared and the system of safety brakes clearly did not work,  Transport and Infrastructure Minister Enrico Giovannini visited the area on Monday and said the government would also set up a commission to look into Italyaposs worst cable car disaster since .That year  people died after a low-flying US warplane accidentally cut through a supporting cable. He said: The government, as well all the institutions, are naturally committed to understanding the causes, to understanding what happened.  The cable car underwent major maintenance work between  and . Checks were carried out in  and again last year by specialist technicians.Italian media reported that the wires were not due to be replaced until . The cabin could hold up to  people, but was less than half full because of restrictions to prevent COVID- infections. The lt station had been closed much of the winter because of coronavirus and had reopened last month.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorMore OnCar crashesAccidents"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/KCes_Baker_Hughes_GE_Subsea_Centre_Montrose_190619-2_31224588-848x564.jpg ","title":"baker hughes redundancies out of the blue at major montrose employer","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remOil and gas company Baker Hughes has made a round of redundancies at its Montrose facility.Workers finishing their nightsht yesterday were handed termination letters by company bosses.Then several workers arriving for the day sht were also told their employment would end and were sent home.It is thought the total number of Angus redundancies is around  staff.Baker Hughes is one of the largest employers in Angus.

have launched a petition demanding new accommodation is affordable.The St Andrews Campaign for Affordable Student Housing Committeelaunched a petition on Wednesday, which calls for proposed new student halls at Gap Site , currently under planning stages, to be affordable to all students.Campaigners say accommodation often costs more than half of the financial support students receive through grants and loans.Lily Von Geyer, a second-year student who is part of the CASH committee, said that students are fed up and want St Andrews to be accessible to people of all financial backgrounds.She said: #St Andrews is renowned for being quite exclusive, Prince William came to this university, it’s not like it’s a common place to study and I think the general reaction has been we want St Andrews to be more inclusive.#The petition, which already has more than  signatures, said the new accommodation Gap Site  must contain a minimum of % affordable beds and rent should be be no greater than % of the maximum student finance and SAAS loans.Lily added: “I’m just hoping that it unies students a bit more because every single person in St Andrews is affected by how expensive halls are.#It’s really expensive to live here.”The plans for the new student accommodation, Gap Site , were unveiled in November last year and include a budget of around £ million.The development is set to deliver almost  beds and will be situated between two current halls, Agnes Blackadder and Andrew Melville, offering half catered and half un-catered services.Lily added: “If we don’t manage to get our demands met by the petition, we’re just at least bringing students together and unying them to show thatwe all come together, we can make a change.“If we do manage to achieve our demands then I guess the next step is saying why aren’t all halls following this kind of benchmark ”The target opening date for the Gap Site  student accommodation is .A spokesman for St Andrews University said: #We have more than trebled the size of our accommodation bursaries at St Andrews in recent years, and we are working hard to raise more funds for this vital area of student support.#At the request of students themselves, our bursary support now follows the student, enabling access to the full range of accommodation in St Andrews – whether that be university managed accommodation or private flats in town.#Unlike many other universities, our rents cover energy bills and wi, and we are committed to provide a ied mix of accommodation types.#We’ve recently sanctioned investment of over £ million to provide  new places in our halls of residence for students to ease the pressure on the private rental market. We are also developing a -bed affordable housing scheme for its early career staff and postgraduate students.#Across our existing residences, a signicant proportion of accommodation already meets the NUS definition of affordability, but we are always committed to listen to student voices, and where possible, explore new ways of expanding support for students concerned about accommodation costs.#Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"grew-glasgow-its-best-city-world---alexanders-gallowgate-memories","story":"Earliest memory of Glasgow  I remember being scared when the bombs were dropping on Glasgow during the Second World War."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering-janey-buchan-fierce-glasgow-mep-fought-civil-rights","story":" Janey Buchan was a fierce cultural and political activist.

It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began.After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus.The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-.

where she hopes to secure Olympic qualication for the m, women’s relay and mixed relay.Clark has been grateful for the use of the outdoor and indoor tracks and gym facilities at Aberdeen Sports Villagewhich has meant she was able to continue training six days a week throughout the second lockdown.She said: “The first lockdown was tough but ASV let me back in as soon as they could, and I will never take the track for granted again.“There’s been no disruption to training during this second lockdown which gave us uninterrupted access throughout winter which has helped me to get track fit.“I certainly wouldn’t be in the position I am now in terms of preparation and fitness level without the support of the team at ASV.“Since I didn’t race last year, it’s put me in a really good mind set as I have that race excitement back.“I’ve been opening up with some of my fastest ever times, and I feel I have unfinished business.“I’m confident I’m in good shape so I hope I have to chance to show it.”Clark’s coach Eddie McKenna believes the lack of racing in  has actually helped her.McKenna hopes Clark will be able to deliver her best this summer and secure her spot at the games in Tokyo which runs from July  until August .He said: “This allowed us time to get back to the fundamentals and fine tune training and speed and there is no doubt that Zoey’s performance in Poland demonstrated that.“However, we are under no illusion of the scale of training for the Olympics and we now have our focus fully on delivering strong performances at the British Championships in the hope that Zoey secures Olympic selection.“Zoey is a funded athlete, so we have been very fortunate to have access to ASV since July allowing us to consistently train on the track.“Getting Zoey to the highest possible place in her career requires a joint coaching team, support network and facilities and ASV is very much a part of that team and the leadership within the sports village is included in that partnership to help Zoey achieve her very best.“The Olympics are the biggest show on earth and it’s an extraordinary achievement for any athlete to reach it.“We have between now and June to qualy and going by Zoey’s past record, she delivers when it matters but the level of intensity gets higher as expectations get higher.“I have coached her to be at her peak aged , , , so she will not be at her very best until the Paris Olympics.”ASV chief executive Duncan Sinclair says they have been keen to support athletes like Clark in any way they can during the pandemic.He said: “One of our main priorities throughout the past year has been to support ASV’s performance athletes in any way that restrictions would allow.“We are fully committed to supporting our home grown talent to achieve their potential in competitive sport.“ASV facilities are world-class and offer a home and training base for North-east athletes to prepare and compete against the best in the world.“It’s been an incredibly challenging period for us all, including our athletes so I’m delighted ASV was able to offer its support in this way.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 30 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"from cradle to grave","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And their latest distancing act is to #temporarily suspend# public representation on its Integration Joint Board.I am coming to believe that this critical situation has overtaken long-held belief systems that need to be challenged.In NHS values, the first statement is #working together for patients.#That is well out of date increasingly the patient has been a participator in their care, and the duty of obtaining consent means you can’t have treatment without co-operation.This report goes on to make clear that #collaboration# is a key requirement.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside kids vote for nature","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And then there#s the goats.Leaving the harbour car park, turn right and follow the road back up the hill for m.You will pass two minor roads on your right, the turning to Port Righ on your left.Continue until the school is on your left and immediately look for a forestry road to your right .Turn right on to the track, keeping the car park to your left. Ignore a small path to your right and continue to a T-junction.Turn rightpast the village playing fields, with woods to your left. After m, turn left at a fork in the track into the woodland .The track meets the other route just ahead. Veering left your path climbs noticeably over the next .km, through plantations, past the reservoir off to the right # worth a small detour # until arriving at a junction.The Kintyre Way continues north whereas your path heads sharply left to continue up the hill.The next section opens out and is a lovely part of the walk, with excellent views back to Arran.After a few minutes, and as the path heads south on the higher section, look for the path to the summit on your right.It is now a very short hop to the summit Trig pointfor some lovely views right down Kintyre and towards Ailsa Craig.Although known as Deer Hill, Cnoc an Ghabar translates as Goat Hill I suspect there will be an explanation!Return to the path, meandering southwards for .km, with the odd little up and plenty of steep downs, passing back into the woodland where it meets another track.Turn left and look out for the path right just over m ahead.

With their strong Gaelic and Norse heritage they defied the will of kings, and their political influence was undeniable.This independence of spirit might account, in part at least, for a modern-day habit of Islay folk # to enter the world of politics.With the election earlier this month of Jenni Minto as constituency MSP, the island now has three serving Argyll and Bute politicians, with council leader Councillor Robin Currie and Councillor Alastair Redman.Orkney and Shetland LibDem MP Alistair Carmichael, another Ileach, can be added to the list # and there may be more out there.Then there is George Robertson # now Lord Robertson of Port Ellen # former Labour politician and Secretary General of NATO, and the much-respected late Labour leader John Smith, both of whom have Islay connections.All of the above from an island of little more than , people.The Argyllshire Advertiser decided to ask the politicians themselves for their theories about why Islay has the habit of producing a preponderance of politicians.Leader of Argyll and Bute Council Robin Currie explained: #Ileachs are known for their sense of community, their enthusiasm for their island and their culture, and their erse mix of skills and resilience # so it#s no surprise that so many of us want to take that a stage further by representing not only our own island but the whole of Argyll and Bute, or indeed the country itself, as is the case with George Robertson and the late John Smith.#All of these characteristics will stand anyone in good stead when it comes to le as an elected representative, whether that’s at local or national government level.#It#s great that [in Argyll and Bute] we have a good balance of elected representatives of all political flavours, who understand the needs and characteristics of that mix of communities, and who can bring that knowledge together to work on issues of strategic as well as local importance.#Councillor Currie added: #It goes without saying that I wish my fellow Ileach, Jenni Minto, every success in her new role and I look forward to working with her.#Conservative Alastair Redman # one of three councillors serving Kintyre and the Isles alongside Councillor Currieand Tarbert#s Anne Horn# pointed to Islay#s #unique economy and location# as part of the reason for its political prominence.#Islay is both rural and at the same time heavily industrialised with our large number of distilleries,# he said.#It might be considered isolated yet is a global trading powerhouse. We on Islay have a population of just a few thousand yet our name is world famous.#There is also our history which to a degree separates us from mainland Scotland. Finlaggan was the seat of the Lords of the Isles under Clan Donald with roots that go back beyond the Kingdom of Scotland, beginning with Somerled in the th century.#I feel that this has led to Ileachs being more independent and perhaps at times more forthright than others.#I hope that many more councillors, MSPs, MPs, cabinet ministers, lords and even prime ministers will come from my home island which, though small, has made a huge mark on this world.#The last word goes to the newest member of Islay#s political gang, Jenni Minto MSP.The SNP member also cited the island#s past influence on Scottish politics through Finlaggan and the Lordship of the Isles.And she highlighted more examples of single-minded Ileachs making their mark on the world.#In - three ships with Islay people on board sailed for the New York colony,# said Ms Minto.#On one of these was five-year-old Alexander McDougall, who became a key figure in America’s war for independence. He had a very successful le, rising to the rank of Major General in the continental army. He then entered public service and was elected to the New York state senate. On his death he was described by George Washington as one of the five pillars of the American revolution.##I am not Islay-born,# she continued, #but feel very lucky to live on such a wonderful island. I often describe it as the centre of the universe, and there are very few places you can visit without meeting someone from Islay or someone who has a connection with the island.#I think that coming from, or living on, an island you need a level of resilience and creativity but you also have a true sense of community and working together.#Islay is also known to be a friendly place, where everyone has time to chat and listen to other people’s thoughts and views.#I think all of these traits are needed in politics and so perhaps it is not a surprise that Islay people have entered public service.#PICS:Jenni Minto MSP. no_aScotElection_McglynnArgyll and Bute Council leader, Robin Currie. aelectionCurrienoCouncillor Alastair Redman.

However, there now seems to be an acceptance in Transport Scotland that a new solution has to be found.In a letter to the press, George Allan points out that the -mile route from Strathlachlan to Colintraive and the eight miles between Ormidale and Tighnabruaich were designed and constructed in  or  years.I was a member of the survey and design team on these routes. I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.Philip Shimmin, Inverness.Sir,I would like to say thank you to all the lads who have been working at the Crinan Canal # often when the north winds were blowing and water was pouring down from the hills into the empty canal more quickly than the pumps were able to remove it.The men greeted me each morning as I walked past to go over the temporary bridge. They were trying to renew the basement concrete which supports the new bridges in spite of the wet, cold weather.Fortunately, April was drier and they managed to fit the new gates thanks to the massive cranes and the skill of the lorry drivers carrying these heavy loads to and from the canal.Others have cleared the rubbish, including lots of old car tyres, which had been dumped.It is good to see the canal filled and in working order again.J Thorgrimsson, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"reduce farm costs save time and make life easier","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Don’t mow when grass is wet or during a drought and don’t collect your clippings during dry spells as this helps conserve moisture.Keep watering throughout the summer unless there is a water shortage and repair bare patches with turf or re-seeding.This is also the month to ensure that all your plants are adequately fed, particularly those in baskets and tubs.Plants benefit from a regular feeding programme as they are growing vigorously and need their nutrition levels to be kept up. Slow-release granules are a good idea for pots and baskets because they last for about six months and release food as it is required into the compost.Not often thought of as a container plant, but an excellent option for small gardens, is a rose.A simple solution for June is to create an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.Just buy a selection of dferent sized pots, plant them with a ieties of roses and then place them together in a group.There is a rose for every garden situation. From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew. Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and midsummer day arrives, here are few ‘must do’ jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters a unique holiday destination","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But never mind, Chinese astronauts, who regard a moon base as essential for probing outer space, have just about solved these problems with a bioregenerative le support system called Yuegong-, or Lunar Palace  . LP is a temperature and humidity-controlled, sealed, articial human-animal-plant-microorganism ecosystem in which oxygen, water and food sources are recycled to create an Earth-like environment. The latest experiment had LP in use continuously for a whole year, with two crews of four each having two periods of occupation and the maximum stay being  days. All emerged fit and healthy.LP comprises a living area, two cabins for growing plants , an animal-raising room housing yellow mealworms and waste treatment and storage rooms.Crew requirements # food, water, oxygen and waste disposal # are accommodated as follows: plants and mealworms provide food, the latter being processed into ‘flour’ for bread.Plant photosynthesis provides oxygen and consumes CO, while puried water from plant transpiration and condensation provides drinking and washing water.Nitrogen puried from crew urine generates plant fertiliser, while the remaining urine is puried along with waste water for plant irrigation.Crew faeces mixed with straw are fermented by bacteria to produce CO for plant photosynthesis, while fermented vegetable waste is fed to the mealworms. The whole system achieved  per cent recycling, the only non-recyclable product requiring storage being solid waste from fermented faeces.All this represents huge progress, but we are not there yet. Running LP requires massive energy input, particularly since lunar days and nights each last an Earth month, and the nights are freezing.But still, I have read of plans to build kilometre-high lunar towers bearing solar  , possible because of the moon’s zero gravity, but don’t hold your breath!* https:doi.org . ...# arxiv.org abs ."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 21 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We have had communications about how to pick it up.#Councillor Findlay, one of three members for the Isle of Bute ward, then asked: #Should it be compulsory for managers to complete the survey #It is vital that managers lead and lead well, so I am quite disappointed by the response.#Ms Fowler replied: #We try to avoid compulsion because we are trying to work collaboratively with our colleagues. We look to get as wide a representation as we can.#Feedback to the nature of the policy itself was more positive, with SNP Helensburgh and Lomond South councillor Richard Trail saying: #I welcome this change of emphasis, changing the policy from talking about absence to supporting attendance.#This, we hope, will improve attendance, but how will we measure that in the months and years ahead  Have you any kind of measures you will be able to bring to us ##We have detailed information on what our absences have been like during Covid,# responded Ms Fowler. #We had a requirement to report on it on a weekly basis.#We will see levels of absence reported on scorecards so members can see what our rates of absence are.

worldwide pressure for China to be more open about the outbreak, aiming to head off complaints the president has not been tough enough as well as to use the opportunity to press China on alleged obstruction.Mr Biden asked US intelligence agencies to report back within  days.He directed US national laboratories to assist with the investigation and the intelligence community to prepare a list

the intelligence community had ldquocoalesced around those two scenarios but ldquodo not believe there is sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the other.He revealed that two

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The shutdown means the loss of nine jobs at the plant, but local farmers believe the knock-on effect on employment will be even worse.Farmer and shareholder in the company Tony Archibald said: #It could mean the loss of another job on every dairy farm, not to mention the milk tanker driver.#The farmers are looking at ways of opening the creamery. It is very important because it is the one thing we have as a raw material for over here.#The farmers were due to meet as the Courier went to press to discuss ways of re-opening the creamery and they also plan to meet representatives of Scottish Milk.Mr Coffield described the closure as #devastating#. He said: #There#s not a lot of work round here. The main feeling about the place is disbelief.#The creamery produced about  tonnes of cheese a year.FIFTY YEARS AGOColour TV comes to CampbeltownColour television is to be launched in Campbeltown next Tuesday by Redfusion.And to mark the occasion, Redfusion is staging a demonstration exhibition in the town#s White Hart Hotel, where about six sets will be on view.The exhibition will be open to the public for three days.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It#s a really exciting move as it offers the potential to climb the Scottish football pyramid.#From the club#s point of view, we want to find our standard amongst the new teams joining the set up.#We want to be the best we can be as the senior team of the Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.#With our acceptance into the WoSFL, we can offer a pathway for the youngest age groups right through to the under- side, being trained by Stuart Crossan, into our first team, representing Campbeltown in non-league football.#With that, it#s important to acknowledge the huge amount of hard work that has gone into making Campbeltown#s community club a Gold Merit Award holder, one of only seven clubs in the Scottish Football AssociationWest region, encompassing all of Glasgow and the west. This accolade was a major factor in our acceptance into the WoSFL.#Other factors in the Pupils# favour before WoSFL committee scrutiny included having changing facilities for two teams of up to  players each, a separate referee#s room, and an enclosed ground with spectator barriers.Campbell said of the club#s Kintyre Park home: #The renovation of the pavilion is nearing completion, through a fundraising campaign led by club chairman Alex McKinven.#Campbell added: #The SAFL was a great  for us to play competitive amateur football for  years. In periods, we went through some wilderness years but we have happy memories of successful title-winning seasons, too.#In recent seasons, however, the club became disillusioned with how the league was going, with dficulty getting referees and sometimes teams to travel to Kintyre at a week#s notice – this was not a feature against even rival teams in years gone by.#In the WosFL, our geography could not be a determining factor in league entry as we are SFA West region members, which meant that the criteria we could meet on a match day, and the quality of our community club pathway, mattered most.#Meanwhile, the Pupils are gearing up for le in the WoSFL with contact training resuming on Tuesday evening.The team have been training twice weekly in a non-contact setting to build up their base fitness since March.Campbell added: #Training has been well attended, led by coaches Norman Thomson and Lewis Mackay, and although it has been hard to get the players together with ongoing restrictions, the squad are right behind the move and excited about the challenge ahead.#Campbeltown Pupils are keen to hear from anyone who would be able to help with ground and park maintenance. Anyone who feels they are able to help can contact Campbell Robertson, club secretary.For more club updates, follow @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As German troops advanced through Normandy, the st fought valiantly, protecting French citizens, hoping evacuation by sea would be forthcoming.On June  , German tanks surrounded the ision at the French fishing port of St Valéry. This, alongside a curtain of heavy fog, made the long-awaited flotilla rescue unviable and they were forced to surrender. Those who were not killed in the fighting were captured as prisoners of war and marched to camps in Eastern Europe, where they remained for five gruelling years.Following the commemorations to mark the th anniversary of the battle last June, a remarkable story has emerged. One brave soldier miraculously evaded capture and was taken in by a French family who hid him from the occupying German forces.#We were contacted by Monsieur Patrick Prieur, a -year-old St Valéry resident whose grandparents and father remained in the town during the entirety of the war. He told us the story of the escapee and the tragedy that befell him,# said Dr Claire Armstrong, chief executive of Legion Scotland.#As we approach the st anniversary of the battle, we hope to identy this Scottish hero, give him the recognition he deserves and bring peace to his family.#Patrick Prieur recalled the tale his late father told him: #A soldier from the st Highland Division was hidden by a family in the village. They bonded and the family learned he was a married man with a we and two daughters waiting for him tohome.#For several weeks, the soldier remained hidden but, regretfully, he was eventually discovered by German troops and marched through the town to the municipal cemetery.#After being forced to dig his own grave, he was positioned against the cemetery wall and shot. His death deeply upset the townspeople, who had been aware of his hiding, and especially my father, who was only  at the time.#In later years, the Franco-British military cemetery was built and his body was moved there. His grave is marked as #Known unto God# and my father and other villagers tended to it for decades after the war ended.#Monsieur Prieur added: #My father had been gted a piece of paper on which the soldier#s name was written, #Keller Len Scott#, and this became his prized possession. He desperately wanted to find the soldier#s family to tell them what had happened to their beloved and where he was laid to rest, but having very little information, he struggled.#In  my father passed away and, being eager to finish what he started, I recently contacted Poppyscotland and the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association to ask for help.#Michelle McKearnon, head of engagement at the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association, said: #We started to do our own research to unearth the fallen soldier#s identity but only got so far. We believe the name order on the piece of paper may have been written in military fashion, with the surname preceding any given names, so the family name might be Keller.#We#re now at an impasse, struggling to find additional information through our own resources, so we need the knowledge of the wider community to continue our efforts.#Dr Armstrong added: #We are urging anyone who believes they know of or has any information about our #Unknown Soldier#, no matter how small, to get in touch.#This brave man fought valiantly for his country and to repay our debt to him for his service would be an honour, not only for Legion Scotland as custodians of remembrance, but for his family, Monsieur Prieur#s father, the people of St Valéry and, ultimately, for all the #unknown soldiers# who sacriced their lives for us.#Anyone with information that could help identy the soldier should visit poppyscotland.org.uk stvalery"},{"url":null,"title":"engines at the ready mach 1 stages rally gets go ahead","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They did notto the harbour until after pm with the casualty in tow.The following day, Sceptre skipper Tom Smith praised the hard work and efficiency of the Campbeltown leboat crews.Diver Robert Lamont, a member of the leboat crew the night before, went in and removed the damaged rudder ready for Sceptre to be towed by tug to Troon, the finish of the race.The race sails from Oban to Mull, Jura and Arran then Troon, stopping at each island for a team of runners to complete a hill race.Sceptre, with a crew of four, was carrying the boys# team from Glenalmond School, Perth.She had run aground the night before entering Craighouse, Jura. Everything looked fine on the yacht, which was built in Argyll at Alexander Robertson#s Holy Loch yard to compete in the America#s Cup of .#As a precaution, we did not have the boys on board for the tough leg round the Mull of Kintyre to Arran,# said crew member Roger Finbow.#They haven#t missed the race they were on board Blue Damsel, carrying the girls# team.#The decision proved a wise move as not only did the rudder come loose leaving the yacht with no steering, it was flapping wildly and in danger of damaging the hull.As a precaution, the leboat crew put a heavy-duty pump on board but this was not needed.HMS Dragon broke off her sea trials to come to the aid of Sceptre. The Type  Clyde-built destroyer stood by until the leboat arrived.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOCalls were mounting earlier this week for a Scottish Office decision on the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Northern Ireland.The Scottish Office has been considering a business plan for state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne to operate the link with Ballycastle in Northern Ireland since the beginning of February.The company needs Scottish Office permission to become involved in the project.But concern is growing that unless a decision is made soon the necessary harbour work at Campbeltown will not start until it is too late for the service to begin next year.Two Campbeltown ambulance men were among six from Argyll recently presented with long service and good conduct medals by the Duke of Argyll.Ronnie Hamilton and Malcolm Black travelled to Oban for the presentation, carried out by the Duke on behalf of HM Queen.The medals are not awarded automatically but are made on the recommendation of a special .The Duke told the ambulance men: #What you do is not a profession, it is a vocation.#He also paid tribute to their families, pointing out the ambulance men worked anti-social hours for long periods at a time.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown was #switched on# to colour television on Tuesday by the town#s new Provost, William Craig, in his first official engagement.The service has been brought to Campbeltown by Redfusion, the firm which pipes television to several thousand subscribers from its mast at Crosshill Farm.The firm#s Scottish general manager Mr Colin Payne said that Redfusion offers a public service of which they were proud.#We looked at the television problems here. There were just BBC and STV and occasionally Ulster in the town.#We said can we bring to Campbeltown the full range of colour programmes which are available where and the answer to that was #yes#.#There are now six programmes on the system. There aren#t many places in the country which can receive this.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAn English steam liner which called in here for bait one day last week had full bunkers and a plentul reserve of coal in ious corners. She had gone to Ostende for the fuel.A further restriction of the gas supply in the burgh comes into force on Saturday night. The hours during which there will be reduced and normal pressure respectively are given in advertisement.The local branch of the Miners# Union opened a subscription list this week for the purpose of starting a communal soup kitchen. It is not intended, of course, to confine the benefits of the scheme to miners or their dependents. Over £ has already been raised and the committee intend to publish the list of subscriptions next week.A welcome break in our comparative isolation from the mainland was made at the beginning of the week when the steamer Kinloch made a special run to the upper reaches, with mail, passengers and cargo.Many merchants, not only in Campbeltown but at Carradale and the west of Arran ports, were carrying very low stocks and this run was not made a day too soon to prevent absolute scarcity of not a few necessities.Flour, for one thing, was running very short, and the new supplies got by bakers were very much-needed.Alcohol is again tipped as a likely rival to petrol. The new motor fuel is being produced by the Distillers Company Ltd and consists of a mixture of  per cent of alcohol,  per cent of benzole and  per cent of paraffin. The idea of using alcohol is not new, but a fatal obstacle has been the unwillingness of the government to release its hold upon alcohol and permit it to be used for commercial purposes."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and Be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.This week, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulancemarks its eighth anniversary – after a year like no other.Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, our Helimed crews have never missed a beat maintaining our emergency helicopter air ambulance service across Scotland#s mainland and island communities. In fact we#ve enhanced our service with the launch of a new aircraft – Helimed  in Aberdeen last year – which has already had a huge impact on pre-hospital care in the Grampian, Highland and island regions.In our busiest year ever, our aircrew have endured challenging working conditions, with additional procedures and cumbersome protective and safety equipment as they go about an already dficult and stressful job.But they#re not complaining – this is what the Scottish public ask of them, to save and improve lives, wherever the need arises, and they fulfil their role with courage and pride.Our exemplary performance during this national crisis has been a tribute to how far SCAA has come in just eight years and I, for one, am immensely proud of what the SCAA team has achieved.But our operational teams are acutely aware that we are only able to provide this critical service, thanks to the continued public donations which you have maintained throughout these dficult times. So you are the real heroes in our charity.SCAA is the people#s helicopter – funded by the people of Scotland, for the people of Scotland – and our two frontline aircraft are stood by ready to help you, your family, your friends, colleagues, neighbours or anyone in your community when you most need us.As we mark our eighth birthday on May , we are asking the people of Scotland,they can, to support us into the future. Any donation, however small, to celebrate our anniversary will help to save a le – just like the numerous lives we have already saved over almost , missions.SCAA vows to continue to transform emergency care in Scotland, particularly to our rural and island communities, with your support. Thank you.As a coalition of leading providers of care and support to vulnerable children and young people, we congratulate all MSPs on their election and welcome the consensus there is between the major political parties to tackle the growing mental health crisis in our young people.We have for some time raised concerns over a potential lost generation of vulnerable children and young people, whose mental health is being impacted even further by the Covid- pandemic.There have been dramatically increased waiting times for mental health treatment during lockdown.In December , for example,  per cent of children and young people had been waiting more than a year for specialist treatment, compared with . per cent in , a truly frightening statistic.A commitment by MSPs to focus on mental health, increasing investment in support services and intervention strategies, must be a priority for this parliament, giving our young people the care and support they need, when they need it.The frightening statistics on the deteriorating mental health of many young people presents a compelling case for a radical new plan for our struggling mental health services and for a national crusade to address what is a mental health pandemic, underpinned by considerably greater resourcing.This is a crisis we can overcome, but it will require a similar energy and commitment to that demonstrated for Covid-we are to achieve this and prevent many young people giving up on their futures.At sight loss charity RNIB Scotland, we are concerned the Covid- crisis might have impacted on people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older.We would like to highlight the emotional reassurance and practical help we offer during the coronavirus lockdown and its aftermath.Covid has eclipsed all other health news in the past year but  people still start to lose their sight in Scotland every week. Add to that stress over Covid and the lockdowns and there could be more people needing support and reassurance.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute and the Western Highlands for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as families, friends and carers.Losing your sight can be devastating news to take in. But our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.The uncertainty during the Covid lockdown over access to basic shopping and medication, a lack of information in accessible formats, the social isolation, the barriers to being guided because of social distancing # these have all added to and compounded the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.But we want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.To contact the Need to Talk service, phone the RNIB Helpline on    or email needtotalk@rnib.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Any forward player will tell you that. If you have a terrible game and score a goal or play fantastic and not score ndash you are judged on your goals as a forward.ldquoHopefully, I will get another goal but I need to make sure I am in the team. I would love another goal and I love the Scottish Cup. I loved it with East Kilbride and Gala Fairydean Rovers ndash it is great and you love those big moments in competitions.Paton moved from Dublin to East Lothian after signing for Hibs around his th birthday.He lived with Helen Leslie and her two sons, Darren and Jonathan, off Tranentrsquos Waterloo Road and attended Ross High School, where he studied physical education, English and sports leadership.The striker was quick to praise both the family and the school for helping him develop. He said: ldquoThey took me in asI was part of their family.ldquoThey were absolutely fantastic to me and made me feel so welcome.ldquoI went for dinner with them and they were brilliant.ldquoIn my first year, I spoke to Sean McPartlin, education and welfare officer, and he askedI wanted to do something. I agreed to it and they said I would train some days.ldquoIt is the best thing I ever did.That saw Paton ide his time between attending school and training at Hibernian Training Centre at East Mains on the outskirts of Ormiston.The -year-old spent two years at the secondary school and told Courier Sport how much he enjoyed the experience. He added: ldquoIt was brilliant ndash the best thing I ever did, honestly.ldquoI was not too keen going to school at that age with football andI had not then I would not have made many friends. The amount of people I met through school was unbelievable.Paul Reynolds, headteacher of the Tranent secondary school, said: ldquoNot only was Ruari a standout footballer, he was a true gentleman.ldquoHe was always extremely polite and his positive attitude was infectious. I have rarely met someone so filled with optimism.ldquoWith his lsquogo get lsquoemrsquo attitude, he settled into Ross High School very quickly and it was a pleasure to have him here.

After reinforcements had been received, they withstood a siege of nearly three years, under trying conditions, before they surrendered with full military honours in May .The Bass later passed into the ownership of the Dalrymple family, to which it still belongs today.The Bass Rock lighthouse was constructed in  by the celebrated engineer David Stevenson, a cousin of Robert Louis. He made sure that parts of the old castle were demolished for the stone to be harvested to build the -metre lighthouse, which served its purpose well for many years to come.It was lit with gas derived from vaporised paraffin oil for many years, monitored by the lighthouse keeper.Since , when the lighthouse was converted to electricity and remotely controlled, the lighthouse keeper was no longer needed, and the Bass Rock has been without any permanent human resident.From his house lsquoRockstowesrsquo on Melbourne Road, the celebrated postcard artist Reginald Phillimore enjoyed uninterrupted views of the Bass Rock.He had a fascination with the island, visited it many times and wrote a guidebook that he published himself.The Bass Rock is home to the largest gannet colony in the world: , birds spend their summer residence here, having been in Africa for the winter.The gannet, or lsquosolan goosersquo as it was known in Phillimorersquos time, is a large and formidable-looking seabird, with a white body, a yellow neck and head, and black and white speckled wings and tail.The reason that much of the Bass Rock appears white from a distance is the sheer number of birds and their acrid droppings.The gannet hunts fish by ing headlong into the sea, as any visitor to the Bass Rock can observe at close range.The air is full of birds, which are squawking cacophonously, and the smell from their droppings is very noticeable.Phillimore made some beautul postcards featuring the Bass Rock gannets he is likely to have travelled to the island from Canty Bay or on a vessel from North Berwick, but nowadays access to the Bass can be arranged via the Scottish Seabird Centre.This is an edited extract from Jan Bondesonrsquos book R.P.

It is encouraging to witness new entrants, such as WCF, targeting the holiday parks market and competing with the existing multi-park owners that have traditionally dominated the marketplace."},{"url":null,"title":"josh-taylors-fiancee-danielle-murphy-ecstatic-win---hoping-start-wedding-planning","story":"Danielle Murphy watched the fight from home in Haddington after Covid- restrictions prevented her from flying to Las Vegas.Josh, from Prestonpans, beat his American rival with a unanimous points victory to become the undisputed super lightweight world champion.: Josh Taylor crowned undisputed world championDanielle told the Courier: ldquoI am absolutely ecstatic about his win, he has made history.\"All the hard work, dedication and years that he has put into his craft have paid off.ldquoI was gutted not to fly over, there have been other times when he has gone away and we havenrsquot been able to be there but with the magnitude of this fight, everyone wanted to be there to support him, but we were all cheering him on and screaming for him at the television.Danielle said the Taylor family are excited to celebrate when the world champion touches down in Scotland today , but Covid- restrictions are making it dficult.She said: ldquoWe are having to play it by ear because it is hard to book anything.\"Normally we would go into a hall or celebrate in a pub but there are only so many people you can have in aand there is no way you could only pick  people to celebrate, so we arenrsquot doing that.ldquoWe are hoping to be able to get an open-top bus for him, but we need to seethe council will allow that.Danielle was disappointed by the lack of national televised coverage of the fight.She said: ldquoIt is absolutely shocking that the fight wasnrsquot broadcast on a bigger  for others to be able to watch.ldquoThe older generation do not have smartphones, so they were struggling to watch it when it was on because it was streamed through an app.\"Danielle said Josh was flying home on Tuesday for some well-deserved time off.The couple got engaged in Dubai last December.Danielle said: \"Hopefully he can take some time off so we can get our wedding planned and chill for a while.\""},{"url":null,"title":"picture-gallery-duke-duchess-cambridge-visit-heavy-sound-cockenzie","story":"William and Catherine, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, were in Cockenzie yesterday as part of their ongoing tour of Scotland.The couple were visiting Heavy Sound, which works with the Scottish Violence Reduction Unit , a joint project backed by the police and the Scottish Government which tries to tackle the root causes of violence.During the visit, the Duke and Duchess saw young people doing martial arts, music production and bicycle maintenance, organised by community organisation Heavy Sound, which is based at the Cockenzie Hub on Edinburgh Road.Manager Thilo Pfander persuaded Kate to try her hand at making some EDMand at first the Duchess received some encouragement from her husband, who said: \"Yeah, drop a beat in the background.\"Kate did produce a bass-heavy track but added a piercing synth sound over the top.William laughed and said: \"Whats that \"It sounded like a cat...

Commissioned by Our Scottish Future, the pro-Union think tank, it had two headlines. Less than a quarter of Scots think that the Scottish and UK Governments cooperate well today.Nearly three-quarters want better cooperation. Not earth-shattering you might say. Human beings working together ndash itrsquos what we do, right  Amazingly, the poll found  per cent who disagreed. I had no idea the professional political class was so large.Okay, so that last bit is a bit unfair. However, politics is a brutal and competitive business. Greasy poles are not climbed by being nice to your opponents. Point scoring is second nature. Little wonder the population watches on wearily, itching to knock heads together.Nowhere is an inability to rub along more clear than in the fractious relationship between the Scottish and UK Governments. Lack of trust and confidence is re on both sides. UK ministers question whether Scottish counterparts, whose mission is to break up the country, are acting in good faith. Scottish ministers complain the UK Government disrespects their constitutional position.:Coronavirus: Pandemic: Take responsibility  Notyoure a Tory ministerAs in any troubled relationship both sides have a point. I recall extolling to a senior SNP leader the virtues of improving how the UK works. His reply was short and commendably frank: ldquoIrsquove no interest in strengthening the Union. And last year a senior UK Government lsquoinsiderrsquo vouchsafed to this newspaperrsquos UK Political Editor the thought that Boris Johnson ldquooutranks Nicola Sturgeon and ldquohas the pips on the collar.These remarks betray attitudes, which to outsiders appear petty and tiresome. The UK Government springs on devolved administrations a nasty surprise in the form of the UK Internal Market Bill. The Scottish Government refuses to collaborate on improving Scotlandrsquos connections with the rest of the UK. And wonrsquot play ball on developing Freeports, preferring exceptionalist Scottish Greenports ndash asports canrsquot be both free and green.For both, this is short-sighted. Separating Scotland from the rest of the UK is a very bad idea. However,thatrsquos your poison, is it really smart to demonstrate yoursquore incapable of working constructively with your nearest neighbour One whose currency you intend to use on departure, whilst leaving monetary policy in its central bankrsquos hands. And one on whose goodwill yoursquore relying to negotiate favourable lsquoScexitrsquo terms. Thatrsquos why Alex Salmond used to warble on about Scotlandrsquos place in six Unions ndash including a UK social union ndash and turning Scotland from surly lodger to good neighbour.If you think wersquore better together, then the job is surely to show Scots the value of having two governments batting for them that within the UK, Scotland doesnrsquot have to rely on a neighbourrsquos goodwill. Because when the UK Government negotiates with the Scottish Government a new post-Brexit subsidy regime, governance of the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, internal market exemptions or Scotlands fiscal framework, itrsquos not promoting Englandrsquos interests, but those of the whole country including Scotland.Fostering greater trust and confidence isnrsquot impossible. Building better relationships, however, requires investment of time and effort.Sadly, itrsquos not de rigueur these days to speak warmly of David Cameron. Yet in  Nicola Sturgeon said this about him: ldquoDavid Cameron, whose politics and mine are very far apart, always managed to have a personal rapport. You could sit with David and have a fairly frank discussion, agree on the things you could agree and accept you disagree on everything , and have a bit of banter as well. The fruits of that relationship were a fiscal framework agreed, City and Growth Deals for every part of Scotland struck and much more besides.:Andy Maciver: How Ruth Davidson could have become First Minister ndash an alternative historyWith the elections behind us, is it too much to hope for a move from Cold War to a new spirit of detente  More in tune with the national mood and an overwhelming desire to pick ourselves up after Covid.Early signs encourage. The PM is right to reach out to devolved leaders, inviting them to an early summit. And just before the recent election campaign, the UK Government published proposals, developed jointly with devolved governments, to strengthen how they work together. They reveal an impressive package of necessary reforms, most of which is already agreed. Remaining gaps seem easily bridgeable.Are they really going to fall out over what to call the new devolution council  Word of advice ndash the more clunkily contrived the name, the more likely the media will apply a colloquial, short-hand, alternative.And some UK ministers are apparently reluctant for the Foreign Office to establish an inter-ministerial forum for dialogue with devolved administrations because foreign policy is reserved. This is the tin-hatted defensiveness too often bedevilling inter-governmental relations.

When we had to close down our Centre once Covid hit, we knew we had to somehow keep our services going.With lack of income from the groups who use the centre, we have suffered a financial haemorrhage, resulting in a shortfall of pound, and I recognise there is a long road to recovery.Finances notwithstanding, I can only pay tribute to our board of trustees who continued to support and enable us to keep operational and my amazing team which turned our operations into a online continuation of service within  hours.The team worked within the Covid restrictions but also managed to get a range of services up and running, covering everything from delivery of homemade lunches to prescriptions pickup and delivery.Since the May  Holyrood elections and the Scottish Government announcement of new ministerial posts, I welcome Humza Yousaf as Scotlandrsquos new Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care. I wish him success and look forward to working with him.I urge our Scottish Parliament MSPs to implement the recommendations contained in the Independent Review of Adult Social Carethat was published in Scotland in February .People have said for years that it makes absolute sense to combine our health and social care systems, followed by the inevitable caveat that it would be too expensive to achieve this.However, in the last  months, faced with a massive health crisis, bureaucracy and its rule books were thrown out the window and we discovered just how quickly and efficiently major things could be achieved.I ask our new Scottish Parliament to learn from Covid- and recognise this is a unique opportunity to restructure, rebuild and refinance a workable new health and social care model, where funding is adequate to provide for the needs of all the people in Scotland.This includes funding for local health and social care partnerships. The Feeley Report asks for a clear distinction between the range of services provided for older people who have a neurological condition such as dementia and others with complex health needs, as the needs of each group are signicantly dferent.Looking to the future, the question is not whether Scotland can afford to implement the Feeley recommendations but put much more simply, we cannot afford not to do so.John MacMillan is CEO of the Eric Liddell Centre"},{"url":null,"title":"agenda-not-late-build-world-class-stem-education-system","story":"A REVIEW of Scotlandrsquos Curriculum for Excellencendash the cornerstone of Scottish education ndashwill be published in June, and should be regarded as a matter of great signicance to the teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics ndash Stem for short.Calls for an independent evaluation of CfE have been years in the making, and the recommendations from the review being carried out by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , will undoubtedly be pored over by policymakers.The Learned Societiesrsquo Group on Scottish Stem Educationsubmitted oral evidence to the OECDrsquos review, drawing together key issues in need of further national action. As we await OECDrsquos final word on the curriculum, we take this opportunity to highlight some of our concerns.CfE began as a promising development, and it is still laudable for its forward-thinking and holistic aims. Itrsquos not too late for these ambitions to be realised and used to build a world-class Stem education system, however we must first recognise the wider context that has hindered its delivery. Even the best-designed Stem curriculum will falter in the face of pervasive and persistent structural challenges.Reforming the senior phase led to a narrowing of subject choice, sowing the initial seeds for a review of CfE and contributing to declines in enrolment in Stem subjects at SCQF levels  and  since .Secondly, Scotland faces shortages of subject-specialist teachers, and secondary school laboratory technicians, both of which are critical to delivering the kind of engrossing Stem experiences which inspire lelong interest in these subjects.More widely, classrooms are having to resort to multi-course teaching ndash the dficult practice of teaching more than one course in the same timeslot ndash to combat the effects of limited staff capacity and timetabling pressures.Finally, primary teachers can lack confidence in teaching Stem an increased focus on Stem subjects in primary teacher education, both initial and career-long, is required to build teachersrsquo knowledge and understanding in these subjects.Among its widespread havoc, Covid- upended many of our traditional approaches to education, from empty classrooms to exam cancellations. Many of these adjustments were profoundly stressful and often had the greatest impact on the most disadvantaged learners. However, they also prompted important questions and challenged longstanding assumptions of what it means to assess learning.As the pandemic and its aftershocks subside, some of these changes may persist and gain further traction. There could be an opportunity to reconfigure assessments to improve their effectiveness and reduce teacher workloads. However, rather than rushing into any large-scale educational upheavals on the back of post-Covid recovery, any lessons learned will need to be sensitively applied, ensuring they bring genuine benefit for teachers, parents, and pupils alike.Stem education in Scotland faces several obstacles. While valuable in its own right, its role in building the next generation of problem-solvers and keeping Scotlandrsquos economy and research sectors internationally competitive cannot be denied. With the right systemic changes, Curriculum for Excellence can live up to its name ndash and support an exceptional Stem education system in the process.Professor David Cole-Hamilton FRSE is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and interim chair of the LSG."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-restrictions-eased-take-flights-holiday","story":"Damn you, every one, on yesterday mornings am flight from Edinburgh to Faro. I have a very finely curated list of must-visit places and Ive always been careful to choose my flights wisely, not wanting to waste carbon footprint or annual leave or money on a holiday for holidays sake.Fly me anywhere now, though. Im desperate to see family in Australia and New Zealand. Zanzibar and the Galapagos and New Orleans still call to me but at this rate Ill happily jet to Edinburgh just for the experience.Though... just because we can now fly overseas again, should we John Swinney said yesterday that travel is still only permitted for essential reasons. When the BBC spoke to passengers preparing to depart for Portugal they listed their reasons as a reward after a year of studying that its \"always nice\" to get a bit of sunshine and after a year of restrictions, travel is \"well deserved\".Fair enough. \"Essential\" is a term open to interpretation. For some, a wedding is essential. For others, more pragmatic others, a wedding is possibly the least essential event you could dream up.A last visit to someone ill a meeting with a new infant - these are unarguably essential.A holiday for holidays sake takes a bit of rhetoric round about to justy it, but you can justy a holiday after  months of pandemic restrictions without too much heavy lting.Looking at the green light travel options Im pleased to Australia and New Zealand on the green list, for personal reasons, but they wont let us in. Good luck finding a straightforward route to the South Georgia and Sandwich Islands - I suspect many would have to Google them first.St Helena, Tristan de Cunha and Ascension Island are fairly outre choices as well. My friend Janet went to St Helena a few years ago. She had a lovely time but the trip involved an RAF troop carrier and a voyage on the last remaining Royal Mail Ship.So options are limited for green lights. Last week a flight left England for Spain and, on arrival, those who were there for a holiday were put on another flight and sent home again. Amber gambling might not be wise.How to decide whether to fly. The Scottish Government advice, as described, is to avoid overseas travel. Yesterday, Dr Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, told BBC Radios Good Morning Scotland programme that case numbers are rising again and a third wave is not ruled out.\"It would be far better,\" she said, \"And far safer to do the cautious thing now and plan your summer holiday for next year.\"It seems like a lot of buck passing. If people are chided for choosing to go on holiday then they can point to the fact the airlines are selling tickets abroad.If the airlines are pulled up for the fact they are selling tickets abroad they can point to the government, which has given the green light for them to go ahead.If theres condemnation on the government for encouraging overseas travel then - get out of jail free - they can point right back to the people making the choice to go and say its all about personal responsibility.It feels like a blame game in the style of pass the parcel.Its hard to blame airlines for laying on flights to holiday destinations. The industry has been devastated by coronavirus - along with airports - and is looking at years of recovery ahead. Of course the travel industry is going to restart as soon as it can.This disconnect between the Scottish and UK governments is jarring also - caution here and encouragement there.Is leaving people to exercise common sense on this issue the best way forward in lockdown easing, particularly when those in charge cant decide Doors are already cross checked and to manual so we can but hope for a safe landing on the other side."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-les-dennis-now-opera-star","story":"Did I read that right  Les Dennis Yes, the comedian-turned-actor will make his operatic debut at the age of  in the Gilbert and Sullivan opera, playing Sir Joseph Porter.

CMAL. Well, good luck with that. Without any background in the subject, he will probably follow advice from those whose long-range genius created the problems in the first place.:Brian Wilson: SNP hammered hospitality but guaranteed George Square chaosThen we have the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and ndash very much a late tag-on ndash Islands, Mairi Gougeon, MSP for Angus South. The previous ldquoand Islands Minister was Paul Wheelhouse, from the Borders, who for some reason became Minister for Fergusonrsquos although, unlike Mr Dey, he was not a Transport Minister. So many Ministers, so little continuity, so much title-shuffling.The common characteristic is that none of them has constituency interests in either ferries or islands. The SNP have six MSPs in the Highlands and Islandsand none has ever been allowed near either role. This is consistent with nobody from the communities served by CMAL and CalMac being on the boards of either.I doubtthere is a coastal country in Europe, perhaps the world, where the same prohibition would be tolerated. Certainly not in the Scandinavian lands which are so often held up as role models ndash which set me thinking about the Faroes and why the idea of autonomy for the Scottish islands should be taken seriously.Ferries are only the current example. It is inconceivable that an islands-based ferry company could do a worse job. Indeed, the Western Isles Council has just put forward a very coherent plan, both short-term and medium-term, for escaping from the current mess. It should, I suggest, be Mr Deyrsquos preferred reading before he gets to the civil service brief.It would also create enough jobs to be transformational in island communities. For decades in the islands, ldquoGourock has been shorthand for mismanagement, nepotism and worse. It is an anachronism dating back to the  merger of MacBrayne with the Caledonian Steam Packet Companythat the whole show is run from there rather than some of the places it is supposed serve.The same reasoning can be applied to every distinctively island public service, run from afar. Crofting regulation is another easy example. The whole thing is a shambles regulated from a centralised bureaucracy in Inverness. It is impossible to believe it would not be more pro-active and alert to depressing realities on the groundit operated at localised levels.:Brian Wilson: Theres nothing green about iding Britain or closing down the North SeaNeither is the argument confined to the public sector. The first person I heard espouse the Faroes as a role model was the late Ian Noble who had gone there in the s and learned how economic development and cultural renaissance went hand in hand. He applied that principle in Skye, particularly as founder of Sabhal Mor Ostaig, Scotlandrsquos Gaelic college.The lesson has never been built on. Greater political and administrative autonomy would keep people in the islands ndash just as in Faroes where population has gone from , in  to almost , today. Natural entrepreneurism would flourish. How curious that one of the biggest fish farmers in our own islands was recently bought by a Faroese company. Could it ever happen the other way round The neo-colonialism exercised by Edinburgh should be replaced by serious decentralisation. No ldquosubsidy is required. The pretence Scotlandrsquos islands donrsquot pay their way is ridiculous. From Shetlandrsquos oil to Islayrsquos whisky, not to mention a disproportionate contribution to Scotlandrsquos global images and a host of world class products, the islands pay their dues many times over to UK and Scottish coffers.Anyone who actually believes in devolution would see the case for islandsrsquo autonomy ndash not as a threat or challenge but merely as a means to better, fairer, more creative governance.The same can and should be argued in urban settings. Look at the great success of the metro Mayors in England and Wales, delivering for their cities and regions because they can stand up to central government. In contrast, Scotland has a higher degree of centralisation than ever before. The challenge to that mindset could start in the islands and work its way in.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

We hope that through these talks we can deliver real change.Greens co-leader Patrick Harvieadded: ldquoPolitics does not have to be about point-scoring and short-termism.\"Green parties across Europe and in countries like New Zealand have in recent years rolled up their sleeves and worked with other parties to deliver a better future.\"But they have also shown that there is more than one way for government and opposition parties to work together, without losing the ability to challenge one another.\"We believe the people of Scotland want to see grown-up politics like this, and will approach the forthcoming talks in this spirit.\"Scottish Conservative MSP Liam Kerr slammed the plans.He said: ldquoThe Greens seem to have finally given up pretending to be a separate party from their nationalist allies.\"Once again, we see that their true colours are not green but SNP yellow.\"A more formal SNP-Greens coalition is a nightmare scenario for the , workers in Scotlandrsquos oil and gas industry, who will be concerned that their jobs are at immediate risk.\"The potential economic damage could have wider consequences beyond the oil and gas industry.\"This is a coalition of chaos that could put Scotlandrsquos entire economic recovery at risk by pushing for another isive referendum while we should be fully focussed on tackling the devastating long-term impact of the pandemic on jobs and businesses.\"Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: ldquoThe First Minister promised this would be a parliament focused on recovery and she would defer a referendum until the effects of the pandemic were over.ldquoIrsquom disappointed to see the First Minister announce plans which would push the recovery aside.ldquoShe has re-announced a host of commitments that her government has failed to deliver in their last three terms in power.ldquoThe emerging Green pact is a sign that independence is the overriding priority. It appears they have even swept aside their fundamental dferences on oil and gas to smooth the path to a referendum.ldquoIrsquove worked closely with ministers over the last  months to help get the country through the pandemic and to agree extra funds for mental health and education. We will continue to hunt for agreement with others.ldquoItrsquos important that patients donrsquot wait longer that twelve weeks for NHS treatment, young people get mental health treatment within eighteen weeks, that we save more people from death from drugs and the poverty related attainment gap is closed completely in schools.\"All these major issues must be delivered before the government presses for another referendum.Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said: ldquoScotland now has three parties of cuts and constitutional chaos in the SNP, Greens and the Tories.ldquoLets be clear this isnrsquot day one of an SNP government. It is day .ldquoIf the First Minister is serious about focusing on recovery, she must commit in the first  days to make this recovery meaningful.ldquoThat means a genuine jobs guarantee scheme for young people and the long term unemployed.ldquoShe must end the unnecessary anxiety surrounding the SQArsquos exam and avoid a second summer of results chaos.ldquoAnd confront child poverty by immediately doubling the Scottish child payment and end the NHS cancer backlog.ldquoThe First Minister has pledged to focus on our recovery and not be distracted by isive old arguments.

I specically remember at a lesson in early January  when the first outbreak happened and we were discussing it in class.ldquoI was explaining to my pupils that there was an area called Wuhan in China, this is happening there, and linking it to what I teach.ldquoWe spoke aboutyou were Prime Minister oryou were a government adviser, what steps would you be doing to develop these critical thinking skills.She continued: ldquoMy -year-old weans understood the concept of closing the borders, of stopping people from entering the country.ldquoIf -year-old kids could understand that, why... is that a fair assessment then to say that the government... that -year-old kids were thinking more about it that the government Mr Cummings replied ldquoCorrect, yes.He said that there were concerns from government that it could be perceived as racist to stop travellers from certain countries coming to the UK, and in a swipe at the Prime Minister added: ldquoFundamentally, there was no proper border policy because the Prime Minister never wanted a proper border policy.He added: ldquoRepeatedly in meeting after meeting, I and others said lsquoAll we have to do is download the Singapore or Taiwan documents in English and impose them here.rsquoldquoWere imposing all of these restrictions on people domestically, but people can see that everyones just coming in from these countries. Its madness, its undermining the whole message that we should take this seriously.ldquoHis basic argument at that pointhelliphe was back to lsquoLockdown was all terrible mistake.rsquoAt an earlier point in the committee, Mr Cummings also told MPs about the Prime Minister being \"stupid to pick a fight\"with footballer Marcus Rashford over the free school meals fiasco.Boris Johnsonrsquos former chief adviser claimed that the Prime Minister was told twice by the director of communications not to take on the striker over his campaign to tackle child food poverty.The Manchester United starrsquos campaign to extend free school meal vouchers for eligible pupils into the summer holidays, amid the coronavirus pandemic, led to a Government U-turn in June last year.The Government made a U-turn again in November after Rashford and child poverty campaigners called for free school meals to be provided to disadvantaged children during the Christmas holidays as well.Pointing to the row, Mr Cummings said: ldquoFor example, the whole thing with Rashford, the director of communications said to the Prime Minister twice, lsquodo not pick a fight with Rashford. Obviously, we should do this insteadrsquo.ldquoThe Prime Minister decided to pick a fight and then surrendered twice.ldquoAfter that everyone says lsquooh, your communications is stupidrsquo. No, whatrsquos stupid was picking a fight with Rashford over school meals, and what should have happened is just getting the school meals policy right.ldquoSo itrsquos easy to blame communications for bad policy and bad decision-making.When asked to score the Government from  to  on its communication with the public and the NHS, Mr Cummings said ldquoone of the great myths was that all the problems from the pandemic were due to ldquobad communications.He said: ldquoFundamentally, the reason for all these problems was bad policy, bad decisions, bad planning, bad operational capability.ldquoIt doesnrsquot matteryoursquove got great people doing communications,the Prime Minister changes his mind  times a day, and then calls up the media and contradicts his own policy day after day after day, yoursquore going to have a communications disaster zone."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"May ,  at : pmThis week’s edition of The Orcadian is now in shops and is available online, here.

I think the Secretary of State for Health is certainly one of those people.ldquoI said repeatedly to the Prime Minister that he should be fired, so did the cabinet secretary, so did many other senior people.Sir Mark Sedwill was the cabinet secretary until September , a period which covered the first phase of the pandemic.Mr Hancock was lined up to lead a coronavirus press conference from Downing Street on Thursday as he rejected Mr Cummingsrsquo allegations.ldquoWe absolutely reject Mr Cummingsrsquo claims about the Health Secretary, a spokesman for Mr Hancock said.ldquoThe Health Secretary will continue to work closely with the Prime Minister to deliver the vaccine rollout, tackle the risks posed by iants and support the NHS and social care sector to recover from this pandemic.He insisted the Health Secretary had ldquoworked incredibly hard in unprecedented circumstances to protect the NHS and save lives.Mr Hancock will appear before the same committee where the series of hard-hitting allegations were levelled on June .Mr Cummings has previously described Mr Hancockrsquos department as a ldquosmoking ruin which could not cope with the demands of the pandemic.On the claim that Mr Hancock lied, Mr Cummings said: ldquoThere are numerous examples.ldquoIn the summer he said that everybody who needed treatment got the treatment they required. He knew that that was a lie because he had been briefed by the chief scientic adviser and the chief medical officer himself about the first peak.ldquoWe were told explicitly people did not get the treatment they deserved, many people were left to die in horric circumstances.Mr Hancock had also blamed NHS chief Sir Simon Stevens and Chancellor Rishi Sunak for PPE problems.Mr Cummings said he asked the cabinet secretary to investigate, who came back and said ldquoit is completely untrue, I have lost confidence in the Secretary of Statersquos honesty in these meetings.The former aide said Mr Hancockrsquos public promise to deliver , tests a day by the end of April was ldquoincredibly stupid because it was already an internal goal.ldquoIn my opinion he shouldrsquove been fired for that thing alone, and that itself meant the whole of April was hugely disrupted by dferent parts of Whitehall fundamentally trying to operate in dferent ways completely because Hancock wanted to be able to go on TV and say lsquolook at me and my k targetrsquo.ldquoIt was criminal, disgraceful behaviour that caused serious harm.Accusing Mr Hancock of ldquoappalling behaviour towards Prof Whitty and Sir Patrick, Mr Cummings said: ldquoHe used the whole lsquowersquore following the sciencersquo as a way so that he could always say, lsquowellthings go wrong, wersquoll blame the scientists and itrsquos not my faultrsquo.He suggested Mr Johnson kept Mr Hancock in place because he was told ldquoyou should keep him there because hersquos the person you fire when the inquiry comes along.At Prime Ministerrsquos Questions, Mr Johnson was asked whether the cabinet secretary had ldquolost faith in the Health Secretaryrsquos honesty.Mr Johnson said: ldquoThe answer to that is lsquonorsquo and Irsquom afraid I havenrsquot had the benefit of seeing the evidence that he is bringing to the House, but I must say that I think what the people of this country want us all to do is to get on with the delicate business now of trying to reopen our economy and restore peoplersquos freedoms, get back to our way of le by rolling out the vaccine.PressedMr Johnson still has confidence in the Health Secretary, the Prime Ministerrsquos official spokesman said: ldquoYes, the Health Secretary has been working closely with the Prime Minister throughout and has been fully focused on protecting the health and care system and saving lives.copy -.

Destinations include Portugal, Israel, Iceland, Australia and New Zealand.However, today’s poll reveals many are still deeply reluctant to hop on a plane abroad any time soon.People were asked, once vaccinated, when they would consider a foreign holiday.Just % said they plan to head away in  — % may travel this summer while another % would consider an overseas trip later in the year.The vast majority , said it would be next year before they think about going abroad.Another % said it would be two or three years before a trip outside the UK or Ireland, while % have no plans to go overseas at any point.The remaining % were unsure or had no firm opinion.Fewer older people are willing to consider overseas travel this year. Just % would consider doing so — % this summer and % at any point this year. More than halfsaid it would be next year before they consider jetting off, while % would leave it two or three years.By contrast, almost halfof  to  year olds are considering heading overseas this year — with % hoping to get away in the next few months and % later in the year. Another % will leave it to . Broken down by gender, males of any age are more willing to take a trip abroad — % plan to do so this summer and a further % will at some point in . Another % said it would be next year.However, just over a quarter of females plan to holiday abroad in  — % this summer and % this year. Some % plan to leave trips to .It comes as a public health expert from Belfast warned against summer holidays — despite the traffic light system for foreign travel.Professor Gabriel Scally told holidaymakers to “beware” and also warned it is “irresponsible” to travel to other countries while potentially infected with a dangerous iant.Prof Scally, a member of independent Sage, said: “The regional director of the World Health Organization in Europe issued a statement in the last couple of days saying there shouldn’t be international travel and I would agree with that.“It is undesirable to have people holidaying in international resorts at this time for all sorts of reasons.“It isn’t necessarily safe to travel on airplanes, there was a flight between India and Hong Kong and there were  infections and they were only picked up because of quarantine in Hong Kong.“Flights are dficult, but it isn’t just the flights, it’s what happens at arrivals and departures with queues of people in restricted spaces.“You also have lots of people from dferent countries mixing together at foreign resorts.“If you think back a year, the virus came to the UK and Republic of Ireland by people ing from holidays.”He continued: “It’s important to remember that the vaccine isn’t the cure all.“There’s always the risk posed by iants and it’s irresponsible to go off to another country and potentially take a dangerous iant with you.”Prof Scally also criticised the traffic light system, saying: “We need a proper managed quarantine system for everyone arriving into the country.”The Department of Health and the Executive were contacted for comment.Yesterday an airline industry chief said people who have received both doses of the Covid- vaccine should not face restrictions when travelling to countries on the Government’s amber list.Willie Walsh, director-general of airline body Iata, said people should be allowed to make up their own minds about the risks of travelling to amber list destinationsthey have received their jabs.Those ing from countries on the Government’s amber list must quarantine at home for  days and take pre-departure and post-arrival tests.But Mr Walsh, who is the former chief executive of IAG — the parent company of British Airways — said amber restrictions should be the same as those for green list countries for fully vaccinated passengers.He told the Mail on Sunday: “People were promised the benefit of being vaccinated — a vaccine idend — and they should be given it.“I thinkyou’ve had both shots then there’s no argument you can make to say those restrictions can remain in place, and people should be free to decide for themselvesthey see any risk in travelling to a green or amber country,” the former IAG chief executive added.Belfast Most ReadTragedy as toddlerdies after car incident near his homeEx-Alliance councillor who claimed ‘racist under-current’ in party before DUP defection dies suddenlyBill for -day quarantine stay at hotel almost twice usual rateVictim of notorious paedophile Billy Adams tells of role pervert’s twisted priest gay lover played in financing her sexual abuseChannel  Father Ted racism warnings ‘disappointing,’ says creator Graham LinehanTop VideosPlay#Unionists have had to pay the price for Brexit# Cllr John Kyle tells NI committeePlayVideo: Donkey gets emotional when reuniting with ownerPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentLatest CoronavirusNI man finds his voice in time to sing charity songCummings: PM thought Covid was ‘scare story’ and Whitty should inject him on TVCovid expert Gabriel Scally calls for ventilation certicates in all Northern Ireland workplaces Mapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averagePoll: % in Northern Ireland believe parents should have right to refuse Covid vaccine for childrenLatestNI medical chief will not be drawn on Cummings’ attackKelly Clarkson to takeover Ellen DeGeneres’ slot on US daytime TVBiden orders investigation of Covid- originWolfe and Porsche top list of unusual baby names in Northern IrelandUber signs ‘groundbreaking’ recognition deal with GMB union,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurney PAAndrew MaddenTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailMore than half of people in Northern Ireland believe parents should have the right to refuse a Covid vaccine for their children, our poll shows.The news comes after Northern Ireland’s vaccine roll-out opened to those aged  to  and a raft of Covid restrictions are lted from Monday.“This has been made possible because of the success of the vaccination programme and the majority of people acting on the public health advice,” Health Minister Robin Swann said.According to the Belfast -LucidTalk poll, % of respondents felt parents should be able to refuse a vaccine for their children, while % felt they should not and % said they did not know, were not sure or had no opinion.The figures, however, y depending on the age and religious make-up of those who took part in the poll.Regarding  to  year-olds, a majorityfelt parents should not be able to turn down a vaccine for their children, while % felt they should and % didn’t know or had no opinion.Those aged  to , on the other hand, had starkly contrasting views. Some % said parents should be able to refuse a vaccine for their children and % said they should not. And % said they didn’t know, were unsure or had no opinion.Vaccines may be refused for a iety of reasons. For instance, earlier this year several countries temporarily halted the roll-out of the AstraZeneca jab due to concerns of rare blood clots.Due to evidence suggesting that younger people may be at greater risk of the extremely rare clots associated with the AstaZeneca vaccine, those in this age group can choose which vaccine to receive.The latest advice states that anyone under  can book a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, or they can make what the Department of Health has described as an “informed decision” and get the AstraZeneca jab at Belfast’s SSE Arena or at participating community pharmacies.More than one million people in Northern Ireland have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine to date.Looking at the religious make-up of those who took part in the poll, it is apparent that Protestants are more likely to feel parents should have a say over vaccinating their children than when compared to Catholics.Some % of Protestant respondents felt this way, while % felt they should not have the right to turn down a jab for their children and % had no opinion, were not sure or didn’t know.Of those designating as Catholic, % felt they should have the right to turn down a vaccine for their children and % did not. The remaining % said they didn’t know or were unsure.In terms of those of no religion, % were in favour of parents having this right and % did not. Some % weren’t sure or had no opinion on the matter.On Sunday the Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride urged everyone to get vaccinated. He said: “A Public Health England study has found the vaccines are highly effective. This underlines the need for people to come forward for their first and second doses as soon as they are available.”Belfast Most ReadTragedy as toddlerdies after car incident near his homeEx-Alliance councillor who claimed ‘racist under-current’ in party before DUP defection dies suddenlyBill for -day quarantine stay at hotel almost twice usual rateVictim of notorious paedophile Billy Adams tells of role pervert’s twisted priest gay lover played in financing her sexual abuseChannel  Father Ted racism warnings ‘disappointing,’ says creator Graham LinehanTop VideosPlay#Unionists have had to pay the price for Brexit# Cllr John Kyle tells NI committeePlayVideo: Donkey gets emotional when reuniting with owner\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news bcc .ece AUTOCROP wh dcfffaaeeed.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news bcc .ece AUTOCROP wh dcfffaaeeed.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayGlenn Quinn murder policeto Carrickfergus scene for forensic searchLatest CoronavirusNI man finds his voice in time to sing charity songCummings: PM thought Covid was ‘scare story’ and Whitty should inject him on TVCovid expert Gabriel Scally calls for ventilation certicates in all Northern Ireland workplaces Mapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averagePoll: % of Northern Ireland people plan holiday abroadLatestNI medical chief will not be drawn on Cummings’ attackKelly Clarkson to takeover Ellen DeGeneres’ slot on US daytime TVBiden orders investigation of Covid- originWolfe and Porsche top list of unusual baby names in Northern IrelandUber signs ‘groundbreaking’ recognition deal with GMB union,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

You could be forgiven for thinking officials want to make travel as dficult as possible.At the same time, the UK and the Republic of Ireland have two dferent traffic light lists which are constantly in flux, depending on the changing landscape in dferent countries around the world.For example, currently anyone flying into the Republic of Ireland from Canada or the US has to stay in managed quarantine, whereas anyone arriving into England from both countries only has to isolate at home for -days.There’s no obvious reason for the disparity and it certainly adds to the whole confusion around foreign travel and what is and isn’t safe.The desire for some summer sun after a long, miserable lockdown in Northern Ireland is understandable — but a holiday is even more of a necessity after trying to navigate the rules and advice relating to travel during a pandemic..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadTragedy as toddlerdies after car incident near his homeBill for -day quarantine stay at hotel almost twice usual rateVictim of notorious paedophile Billy Adams tells of role pervert’s twisted priest gay lover played in financing her sexual abuseEx-Alliance councillor who claimed ‘racist under-current’ in party before DUP defection dies suddenlyHe will kill next child, warns niece of paedophile Billy Adams raped at age of eightLatest Northern IrelandNI medical chief will not be drawn on Cummings’ attackWolfe and Porsche top list of unusual baby names in Northern IrelandNI man finds his voice in time to sing charity songDetectives investigating fatal house fire arrest man on suspicion of murderNorthern Ireland’s waste water being tested to track Covid- casesLatestNI medical chief will not be drawn on Cummings’ attackKelly Clarkson to takeover Ellen DeGeneres’ slot on US daytime TVBiden orders investigation of Covid- originWolfe and Porsche top list of unusual baby names in Northern IrelandUber signs ‘groundbreaking’ recognition deal with GMB union,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Two wins from two is a pleasing start to their promotion challenge and McKaigue described their latest victory as a relatively disciplined performance. On a day when Derry scored - from play, he was pleased with his sides very clinical display in front of goal. “The goals changed the flow of the game, there is no doubt about that,” added McKaigue, who helped restrict Sean Quigley to a solidarity point from play. “We are under no illusions, we are still far from the finished article,” he also offered. Going the next step will only come with a run of games. He referred to a league semi-final that Derry have almost two feet in, with a score dference as good as an extra point on the table. googletag.cmd.push With Ulster champions Cavan coming down the tracks on Saturday, McKaigue expects no let up. “We have so much to work on and we havent had a huge amount of games.” he said. Then, factor in competition for places and his manager Rory Gallaghers outlook. “With the way Rory is, its a hard edge mentality and we try to win every game. We have to respect the other teams in the group and try to put our best foot forward.” McKaigue, who made his championship debut against Monaghan in , is the elder statesman of the team and the exciting young players coming into the fold were among the reasons why Derry backed themselves coming into Saturdays clash. googletag.cmd.push “Look at Ethan Doherty, look at Shane McGuigan, look at Conor Glass,” he points out. “We have Garethcoming from the back, Paudie Tadfully fit again and Paul Cassidy. “We have some pretty decent players coming through. They are starting to put their hand up and show they are inter-county footballers. “It showed in some of our attacking play, we were very slick and very clinical. We have a few things to tidy up on. We try to focus on ourselves, while giving the opposition the respect they deserve.” McKaigue is one of five current lists to have played in all four isions of the NFL, with Benny Heron the last to start a game in the top flight. The seven-point win over Cork at Owenbeg, in April , wasnt enough to stop Derry from the drop.     It was the last time the Oakleafers won a game in the Ulster championship, a competition McKaigue terms as unbelievably competitive. Winning matches of any kind and climbing the isions. Thats how he views the targets for the new-look Derry squad. “It has been two decent performances, but this group of players has still a bit to go, but the most important thing is winning games. Winning is the currency that matters in this sport. We want to compete and we want to win.” In terms of championship, Donegal and Tyrone have been around footballs top table and have knocked Derry out of the Ulster race. “I think our only focus is trying our very best to try and get out of Division . You want to ply your trade in a higher ision, then the championship takes care of itself. “There is no question about it, a good league campaign gives you great momentum for the championship. “We have nothing to concern ourselves with, only winning as many league games as possible to give us the best chance of preparing for a championship.” Suggesting crunch championship games Derry couldve won and you think of Mayo  and Tyrone , but McKaigue points to another. “The Tipperary gamewas a big one and we were very close to getting to the last  and they went on to the semi-final, to be narrowly beaten by Mayo. “Sometimes people think when youre beat in the Ulster championship, that the championship is over. Derry dont have a bad record in the qualiers, but we need to get a harder mentality to winning games and competing. “When you do that, then you can start talking about dferent rungs of the ladder. For us it is about Cavan and getting into a league semi-final andwe can get into that league semi-final, that is the first championship game of the year.” ALSO READ - Derry ease their way to victory over Fermanagh.

So Ill be in the kitchen prepping on Christmas Eve and then the dinner will be cooked and delivered on Christmas Day for anyone who’s alone or in need of one.Last year we actually had some spare meals left over so I went and delivered them up to the Fire Station, which was the highlight of my Christmas, she said.Paula has been provided with the names of people in the local community who would benefit from the scheme by the Operation Snowball at the OLT and staff at the Long Tower Youth Club.This service is free of charge of course, soyou or someone you know needs help this Christmas please send me a message to the Peggys Kitchen Facebook page,continued Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push Last year we covered the cost of it ourselves, apart from the desserts, but this year Foyle Fruit have kindly offered to donate the potatoes and vegetables and we have also had donations of containers and cups. All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He waves a cursory greeting and continues on his way. In the time it takes me to gather everything I need together, he passes me again, his step count no doubt rising with every lap of the town. Zoom. Walk. Laptop. Bake. Netflix. Repetition has become endemic over the last year, but its something Moneymore cant be accused of. There is a unique feel to the fronts of the buildings that greet me as I walk around the town. Even the post office, now boarded up, remains unbranded. googletag.cmd.push Moneymores terrain gives the town a layered effect. The pillared entrance of The Manor House provides the backdrop to the towns mini roundabout, welcoming motorists coming down the hill from Smith Street. Rusty scaffolding frames a construction site on my left as I make my way down. A woman waters potted plants in her compact front garden. The distinctive smell of curry is emanating from the two Chinese restaurants at the bottom of the hill. Shutters are down on Antonios pizza, yet to open for the day. More scaffolding sits alongside buildings in mid-construction off High Street, but no work appears to be going on today. googletag.cmd.push Along Lawford Street there are ersion signs in place as Council staff busy themselves in resurfacing the Turnaface Road. The grating sound of the road roller echoes off the houses that line the street leading back to the town centre. You could describe Moneymore as ornate. Older, unique buildings, set at dferent levels, create a layered backdrop, crowned by the spire of St John and St Treas church on the top of the hill.  The hum of a small aircraft passing overhead and the unmistakable smell of freshly-cut grass adds to the sense of a town taking new-found pleasure in the mundane.     A pregnant sky threatens rain. Taken a dip I nip into The Mane Barber Shop, where a neon sign declares the shop open for business. Owner Pauline McGarvey is at her lunch. She says reopening has not been the silver bullet the industry was hoping for. “This week has been terrible. For the first seven days [after reopening] it was great, but its taken a dip again,” she tells me. “The older folk that keep you going – your pensioners and farmers and that during the day – they havent been about the same. A vintage tractor model welcomes visitors to the town from the Tyrone side. “It was a gamble coming into a small town. You do have a bit of passing trade but youre hoping people are going to come in from the likes of Coagh, Lissan and Loup. “I said I would give it six months and see how it turns. Its fine, but its not busy. You have that fear of whether its going to come back.” Pauline has been in Moneymore three years, and until the pandemic ruthlessly attacked all businesses, things had been going well.  has seen a seismic change across all industries, driving many hair and beauty professionals off the high street altogether. “Lots of people are working from home and I have to admit, Im tempted,” she says. “Youre still going to be hit with rates, and you havent stopped paying your water bill, your electricity, your rent. “Yes, we got a bit of help, butyouve no customers in, then that money is all going to go and you still have to find wages too. “Ive seen a lot of hair and beauty people who havent gone back from the first lockdown.” Humanity adapts though, and over the last year, Pauline has embraced the situation in which the world found itself. She got married in February, and has enjoyed the extra time with her family. Keeping an eye on litter in the area. “It was the first time in my le I could actually say I was a mummy. I loved spending time with the weans,” she says. “It felt like wed a whole  years wrapped into one year. It is nice getting back though, you need the routine. Its bittersweet in a way.” Cookstown native Pauline says lockdown has really hit young people in the area hard. Her daughter, Danielle, is in Year , her entire GCSE years undertaken amid a worldwide health crisis. “Even she says she could do with another year at school,” she says. “Theyve missed a full year of preparation for the next step. Theyve been living alone in their bedroom. No formal, nothing. They werent even in school to plan it.” Its a quiet day in the barber shop, on what would normally be a busy Friday afternoon, with people popping in ahead of their weekend plans. There would have been excited chatter, the buzz of anticipation. Last minute changes of plan. Maybe even a wee drink. A look at her schedule confirms a gap of a few hours until Paulines next appointment. Without that steady flow of customers, the day can be long, lonely even. Welcome to Moneymore. Company is a two way street, and the dynamic of conversation, service and industry has been greatly missed by both barber and customer. “Even the most bald man that I have is in here every week,” says Pauline. “Two seconds would do it, but you would stretch it out to ten or  minutes, just because he likes coming in for the company. “Sometimes its just nice to get sitting down and get it done for you. Even though I have good faithful customers, I was nervous and jittery the first day back. “The amount of people who are saying its great to see you back, it gives you that wee glow. It would be nice to see a boom in Moneymore again. “I dont think anybody is going to feel anything dferent. Were all just going with the flow and trying not to stress and worry. “I think youre just going to have to wipe this year out the same as last year.”  The indicators that marked the early, panic-stricken days of the pandemic – the empty streets, closed schools, empty supermarket shelves – have long faded into memory. Only the window dressing remains. Sanitisers at shop doors. Face masks in shops. The odd discarded rubber glove on the street. All three car dealerships on the Magherafelt Road are dotted with customers as I drive past on the way home. The petrol station forecourt is hiving with people. By next Monday, theof indoor hospitality will mark another signicant step on the road to recovery. On the way out of the town, I spot a familiar cowboy hat bobbing up and down at the road side. A man enjoying his rediscovered freedom on the fringes of the Sperrins.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I like talking to people I dont know though, because its a whole dferent experience. “My favourite person to interview was BSG Engineering, because I learned team work can make things awesome. “Im hoping to do some more interviews but I dont really know who yet.

Annarose Mullan, a Food Design and Nutrition graduate, launched Meadow Hill Garden Centre a few weeks ago, after finding her chosen career path blocked by last years Covid- lockdown. The -year-old enrolled in a horticulture course at CAFREs Greenmount campus, but the practical nature of her chosen course presented a dilemma. “It was dficult, but it was good at the same time,” she told the County Derry Post. “Everything had gone online. You didnt know your lecturers that well and you were trying to stay focused, but it was good because I was at the house and had no travelling to do. googletag.cmd.push “Thankfully, I was able to just jump straight outside and get to work in the garden, so it was good that way.” Annarose Mullan has been delighted with the response to her new business. The Ballerin womans career pivot was influenced by a long-held interest in gardening, fostered from a young age by her mother and grandmother. “I always had an interest in garden and was always out with my nanny and mammy,” she said. “Sometimes I had doubts, but it was always so natural to do it. I had a lot of support from my family and it was great to get into something over lockdown. googletag.cmd.push “I had experience in factories and office-type work, but I just didnt feel it was entirely for me, because I was going in when it was dark and coming home when it was dark. “It was monotonous, I like more iety, and the garden gives me that. Im meeting more people and its a lot nicer outside, for me anyway.” The garden centre provides a iety of plants and accessories, alongside a refill pottery service where customers can leave pots and containers to be filled. Some of the stock at Meadow Hill Garden Centre. Annarose says the last few weeks has been a busy time for her.     “Im kept busy with orders and there have been a lot of new customers coming in. Word-of-mouth and social media has been great for getting the word out there,” she said. “Its been great, theres been a lot of local support which Im so thankful for. A lot of people have been saying its lovely to come to and the feedback has been great.” More details on Meadow Hill Garden Centre can be found on their Facebook page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Douglas Walker has worked as a hospitality and catering lecturer at the local college for  years. He spent his final day working for the college being reunited with two of his former students, Noel Ward and Andrew Taylor, based at the White Horse Hotel in Campsie. Retirement now beckons for Douglas, following a ied career in which he has worked in restaurants and hotels in countries across Europe. His final destination was NWRC, where he has dedicated three decades to training up new generations of chefs, bakers, pacirctissiers, and chocolatiers. googletag.cmd.push Douglas looks back on a career in which he and his colleagues have worked to forge strong and sustainable connections with local employers, building new careers and strengthening the local economy. “The best thing I have found about teaching is giving students the opportunity to go and work in the industry,” said Douglas. “I’m happy to meet up again with my former student Noel Ward, who has been head chef of the White Horse Hotel for  years, and Andrew Taylor, who has worked hard and is now junior sous chef at the hotel. “These college and employer connections have been extremely important for the growth of the Hospitality sector. googletag.cmd.push “We’ve also been fortunate over the years to send our students to Michelin Starred restaurants like Le Manoir and Gidleigh Park, Devon. “We have also sent four students to the Institute for Ireland Leuven, Belgium, which has given them a great experience in the industry.” After training as a chef in the s, achieving his City  Guild qualications, Douglas travelled to London to work as a commis chef and joined a group of hotels. He later gained his qualications in teaching and went on to work in Frankfurt, Hamburg, and Switzerland before ing to Northern Ireland to work at the Glen House Hotel, Eglinton.     “I had always thought about moving into teaching, and I enjoyed passing on my knowledge to others,” said Douglas. “I started teaching part-time at NWIFHE as it was then in  and I was also teaching Magee’s Ulster University nd year Hotel and Tourism students in their fine dining restaurant Martha Magee’s. “I think I have taught every age range of students that came to NWRC, from School Links, Year  students preparing for le at University, Cookery for Entertainment which included adults from  to , Princes Trust, SEN students in both Strabane and the Strand Road campus and also a large number of adults in the community as far away as Sion Mills and Dungiven. “I’ve also taught the Professional Cookery Course, Professional Chef’s Diploma, and the NVQ Level -, as well as running NWRC’s Flying Clipper fine dining restaurant kitchen on a Wednesday lunch and a Thursday evening. “I enjoyed teaching the Food Production Breads and Pastry Level - courses, and the hugely popular Chocolate skills courses. “I have always had an interest in desserts, and as part of ‘Lecturers into Industry,’ I spent some time in the Pastry section at Le Manoir aux Quat Saisons and Raymond Blanc’s  Michelin Starred restaurant and hotel near Oxford. Since then I have managed to secure many work placements in the kitchens there for NVQ Level  students and also for a lecturer in our department. “As a result of the contacts made, we organised a NI-wide College competition at NWRC’s Northland Road kitchens, judged by Mark Peregrine, head of the cookery school at Le Manoir. “We always enjoy competition work in our department and we’re incredibly proud of the students who got through to the regional heats of the Toque d’ dor in Birmingham.” Married to Ann for  years, and with three grown-up sons, Douglas says he’s looking forward to spending more time with his grandchildren and taking on some voluntary work following his retirement. “I retire from NWRC with many happy memories,” he said. “I send my best to my colleagues as they continue to train and nurture our students. I would strongly recommend a career in Hospitality and Catering to any young person as it offers so many opportunities and although the work can be challenging at times, it will lead to a very interesting and rewarding career.” Kathleen McCaul, Department Head of Hospitality and Catering at NWRC said: “We wish Douglas all the best for his retirement and we thank him for the many years he has given to the college. “The work he has put into moulding our young talent in the field of hospitality and catering cannot be underestimated. His skills, dedication, and passion for the job will be missed.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

That was the last we heard from him.ldquoI was listening to the news all afternoon to hearthere was anything happening. It wasnrsquot until pm that night when I was listening to the RTE news that I heard a priest had been shot in Ballymurphy.Mr Mullan knew in his gut that it was his brother, but could not bring himself to tell his parents, John and Mary.ldquoAll that was said that he was shot, it didnrsquot say he was dead. He was actually dead within  minutes of being shot, he continued.ldquoWe were phoned around am and I found out he was dead. I called the doctor just in case my mother would get badly upset and she was badly upset after the doctor told her. I couldnrsquot bring myself to tell her.ldquoMy father was up the stairs and couldnrsquot come down the stairs but he knew it was bad news.Mr Mullan said it took the Ballymurphy families a few years to organise in order to campaign for truth and justice as a  inquest recorded an open verdict in all the deaths.He has been involved with the campaign for a new inquest for over  years, travelling to Dublin and Brussels and beyond on order to plead the familiesrsquo case.Mr Mullan, his niece Geraldine McGrattan and son Hugh had been regular attenders over the  days the inquest was held.The family, including Mr Mullanrsquos late sister Teresa, lived for a time on the Strand, beside the Portaferry Hotel.While Mr Mulllan took after his father and spent his working le fishing, Fr Mullan spent a year in the Merchant Navy before opting to go to Queenrsquos University and then Maynooth College to train to be a priest.He served for a time at St Josephrsquos Church in Killough before moving to Dunloy for nine years. While his funeral was held in Belfast, he was buried in St Patrickrsquos graveyard in Portaferry.ldquoHugh baptised all my family, he married me and my we Mary, so he was very close to us all, said Mr Mullan.He recalled how his brother loved to sail in Strangford Lough and entertain his family or parishioners by singing along to his guitar.But most of all, Mr Mullan mourns what his brother could have done for others.ldquoHugh was the type of priest who needed to be among people all the time, helping people, he said.ldquoHe was someone who would have given anyone anything he had, even his last penny. He particularly liked to help young people and loved working and encouraging them.ldquoIf he had have got a chance in Ballymurphy, he would have helped the people no end to help themselves. Thatrsquos what he aimed to do with people and was always thinking of dferent things that he could start.Mr Mullan thanked everybody who had called him or send cards over the week and in particular, local priest, Fr Feargal McGrady, for his help and support over the years.Mr Mullanrsquos granddaughter, Mairead OrsquoHare, added: ldquoThese families have fought so tirelessly over the years to get justice for their loved ones, it has been both inspiring and heartbreaking to watch.ldquoI never met my great-uncle, but the stories my Granda tells regularly make his presence known and you can easily tell that the love my Granda has for his brother has never ceased.ldquoHe has known for the last  years that his brother was innocent, he didnrsquot need a coronerrsquos ruling to know that, but having Fr Mullan declared innocent to the entire world has brought much needed comfort and peace..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-World.jpg","title":"‘World knows Hugh was innocent’  ","story":"THE family of Ballymurphy Massacre victim Fr Hugh Mullan have welcomed a coronerrsquos ruling that he was an innocent ldquopeacemaker.The Portaferry priest was shot dead by soldiers as he tended to a wounded man on waste ground in west Belfast on August  .Fr Mullan and nine others shot dead were all exonerated in an inquest ruling by a coroner last week.At the time the Army reported that the nine men and one woman who died were Republican gunmen killed in crossfire.The first to die over the three days of shooting, Fr Mullan had only served a a church for seven months.Mrs Justice Keegan said in her findings that he was ldquounarmed, not acting in any way as a threat, attending to a wounded man in the field and waving a white object as a sign of his peaceful intentions.ldquoHe died as a result of gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen. The shooting of the deceased has not been justied by the State. The use of force by the Army that resulted in his death was disproportionate.Fr Mullanrsquos youngest brother, Patsy, said that he and the rest of his family always knew the  year-old priest was innocent.Now , he said the first learnt something was wrong when he heard that a priest had been shot in Ballymurphy that day on the RTE late news.ldquoI knew right away it would be him, he was the type of person and would be out to help anyone in trouble or who was injured. That was just his nature. Unfortunately it was his downfall, said Mr Mullan, who still lives in Portaferry.ldquoHugh was the type of priest who would have been among people all the time, helping people.ldquoHe was someone who would have given anyone anything he had, even his last penny.Mr Mullan was left unimpressed with an apology that Prime Minister Boris Johnston made in a call to former First Minister Arlene Foster.ldquoI wouldnrsquot have wanted an apology from him actually. I donrsquot have much time for him at the best of times because I donrsquot think hersquos the best person for that job.Mr Mullan, his niece Geraldine McGrattan, his son Hugh and other family members attended nearly all  days the inquest since it started in November .Mrs McGrattan said that hearing the judgersquos findings ldquolted a weight of me.ldquoIrsquove known for the past  years that Hugh was innocent but now the world knows, she said.ldquoTo hear him call him a peacemaker was very touching. It was as though that I had been coiled up in a tight spring and suddenly just released.

This means that plastic litter in the sea is just adding up and, globally, we are adding a truck load full every minute, she continued.ldquoThat is a lot of plastic and, on top of looking bad, it is harmful to sea plants and animals. Every year, plastic kills , sea animals and over a million sea birds. It is a big problem.During last weekrsquos launch event in Ardglass, a number of fishermen told Jenny how sad they were to see how much litter is in the sea and that they have noticed an increase in the amount of it in during their letimes.ldquoIt also takes their valuable time at sea to clear from their nets and can potentially contaminate their catch, so the new scheme is a win-win for them to do their part in getting rid of it.Describing the new project as ldquoinnovative, Jenny said it has already been successful where with fishermen bringing marine litter caught in their nets back to shore.She said the Harbour Authority provides durable bags for the litter to be collected in and that once landed onshore, it is sent off to be recycled or otherwise disposed of.ldquoThis is how our fishermen in Northern Ireland are reducing the marine plastic problem at sea, Jenny explained. ldquoThe thing that makes this project so unique is that fishermen are almost the only people who have access to litter that is out in the open water or at the seabed.ldquoStopping waste entering the sea is imperative, but taking litter out of the sea is too, even though it is more challenging. That is exactly what lsquofishing for litterrsquo fishermen do.Jenny praised the fishermen in Ardglass who have signed up to the scheme as did local councillor, Dermot Curran.ldquoThis is a great scheme and anything which can help reduce the amount of marine litter being washed ashore is to be welcomed, he said.ldquoTen Ardglass skippers have already signed up for the scheme and I hope that there will be more. This is a great new initiative but we also have to look at how litter gets into the sea in the first place which poses problems for trawler skippers as this waste gets tangled up in their nest which is time-consuming and a distraction they could well do without, he said.ldquoThe Fishery Harbour Authority is to be congratulated for bringing this initiative to the Co Down ports and the more skippers that sign up for lsquofishing for litterrsquo the better. The scheme can help protect the environment and reduce the amount of unsightly litter being washed up along the shoreline..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Business.jpg","title":"Business support programme helps secure 78 jobs in district  ","story":"A COUNCIL-LED local business support programme has created  jobs in the last  months.According to new figures released, the Business Growth and Tender for Growth programmes facilitated by Newry, Mourne and Down District Council have helped to create an average of one new job each week.The programmes are part-funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern Irelandprogramme.Despite the impact of recent lockdowns over the last  months, NMD Business has continued to provide SMEs with support packages in response to challenges created by the pandemic.This has resulted in ongoing growth for the business and the creation of  new job roles, as well as helping  businesses involved in the programme to navigate an unprecedented economic environment.Participants in the programme are able to avail of one-to-one mentoring from leading experts, who help guide them and their business through unprecedented times, as well as learning new skills in financial management, cross-border sales and maximising your chances of winning tenders.As a result, many businesses have been able to not only grow their business, but grow their workforce.Sara Velasquez, from Ecoplastic in Downpatrick, completed the programme last year and has already recruited four new staff for the business.Her firm designs and makes all kinds of structures from % recycled material, from boardwalks to street furniture, bridges to bike trails and picnic tables.She said: ldquoThe NMD Business programme helped us focus on the most lucrative areas for growth for our business.ldquoOur dedicated mentor provided us with expert guidance which allowed us to respond quickly to a new market environment, giving us confidence that decisions we were taking were anchored in good commercial sense, while the workshops equipped us with new skills that will stand us in good stead into the future.ldquoSales have since increased as a result and we continue to work on exciting projects across Ireland and the UK.

It was a four-lap course which started at Greenisland Golf Club and carried on via Monkstown Wood, Shore Road and then a bit of a challenge with a hill to contend with on Station Road.The weather was grey with a little drizzle but nothing to cause major problems and in fact Declan felt that there was a slight wind assistance on the climb which was welcome.The overall winner Chris Denton, was the only runner to break three hours and he took top spot on the podium with a time of two hours and  minutes.Declan was more than happy with his own time of . and the fact that he placed seventh overall.

A number have also been vandalised.Councillors will be told tonight that a decision is required to repair, replace or remove these particular units and they will be provided with a detailed breakdown of the work that is required.Toilets at Castlewellanrsquos Upper Square need to be replaced while the outer shell of the building would remain in place, while the existing facility at Market Street in Downpatrick would be entirely replaced.The new strategy suggests that the current public toilets at The Rocks in Ballyhornan would be replaced as would existing toilets at the local authority-owned car park at the Newcastle Road outside Dundrum.Plans have also been drawn up to replace toilets at Crossgarrsquos Lislea Drive and at Ardglass harbour, while public toilets at the New Line in Saintfield mdash which have been repeatedly targeted by vandals mdash would replaced, alongside those at the Quoile Road in Downpatrick.Public toilets the Lough Inch cemetery in Ballynahinch and Struell Cemetery in Downpatrick are also in line for refurbishment under the new council strategy, alongside conveniences at Windmill Street in Ballynahinch.It will also be confirmed at tonightrsquos council meeting that almost  people responded to a -week consultation on the new strategy with over  percent of those who responded agreeing with the suggestion to pay to spend a penny. Concern was also expressed about the cleanliness of some public toilets and their layout.And while council toilets in Newcastle, Dundrum, Castlewellan, Downpatrick, Ballyhornan and Ardglass have reopened after being closed due to coronavirus, those in Saintfield, Ballynahinch, Crossgar and Killyleagh remain closed. They are due to reopen shortly.Cllr Billy Walker has welcomed the decision to reopen council toilets across the Rowallane area and said the fact that these particular public conveniences have been closed or over a year was ldquounacceptable.He said steps should have been taken earlier to ensure that staff were available to open and maintain the ious facilities.Cllr Walker was particularly critical of the decision to keep toilets in Killyleagh closed given the number of people who visited the town over recent months as Covid restrictions eased.ldquoPublic toilets across the Rowallane area were closed too long for my liking and I am aware that there was concern that conveniences at the townrsquos Market House and nearby community centre were also closed, he continued.ldquoI have been informed that all public toilets across the district will be reopened by June and that is welcome news. With the further easing of lockdown restrictions there will be an increase in the number of visitors to the area and it is vital that all conveniences are available..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Success.jpg","title":"Success for young stars in virtual competition  ","story":"PUPILS from Mourne Stars Speech and Drama in Newcastle have been celebrating success once again.Many pupils from Clare Murninrsquos classes took part in Newry Feis this year as they usually would have done previous years.This year was a little dferent.

Instead it was a virtual competition where pupils sent in video recordings of their poetry recitals.All of the pupils used excellent vocal skills showing wonderful confidence in all age categories.ldquoThe Newry Feis is a wonderful opportunity for the pupils of speech and drama to show off everything they learn in class, for example, proper use of tone, pause, pace, pitch, projection, volume and articulation skills, Clare explained.She said she was proud of every one of her pupils who entered the competitions and thanks all of the parents for their unwavering support.She also said she was delighted to see so many of the pupils be awarded within their age categories, which she described as an excellent tribute to the hard work they all put in.If you are interested in your son or daughter taking part in speech and drama contact Clare via email mournestars@gmail or follow Mourne Stars Speech and Drama on Facebook and Instagram..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Tally.jpg","title":"Tally’s men lose out to Mayo stars in opener  ","story":"DOWN senior footballers did not have their fairytale start back in Division  after being comprehensively beaten by a strong Mayo side.It was always going to be an uphill battle for Paddy Tallyrsquos team as they faced off against a recently demoted Mayo outfit in Castlebar.Despite last yearrsquos relegation, Mayo began their campaign with strong intent and although the Mourne county could not be faulted for lack of heart, it was soon clear it was the home sidersquos game to lose.Down started admirably, matching Mayo for the first  minutes as the sides scored four points a piece.However, it wouldnrsquot be long before Tommy Conroy would open the goal scoring as he rapidly burst through the Down defence to place the ball under goalkeeper Rory Burns.Down showed they would not go without a fight and chalked up a couple more points to bring the scores - to - at the half-time interval.The game was perhaps put completely beyond the red and black outfitrsquos reach when Mayo fired home another goal on the  minute-mark.A consolation goal from Down substitute Stephen McConville allowed for a more modest scoreline but evidently, it was clear that this Mayo side will no doubt be pushing for ato the top tier.Down manager Paddy Tally reflected on his teamrsquos performance after the full-time whistle.ldquoI felt, at times, we just didnrsquot get to the intensity of the game, he said. ldquoTo be honest, it was always going to be a wee bit of fun coming here today to see where the boys are at.Itrsquos a bit freaky, a team like Mayo being in Division Two. Naturally there would be a bit of a gap in experience and quality.Mayo manager James Horan was delighted with his teamrsquos effort as he looks ahead to a promising campaign.ldquoSix or seven sessions is all wersquove had so we were very unsure because we just didnrsquot know where we would be, he said.ldquoThe guys, you could see there, did a huge amount of work inidually over the winter. They were in very good shape and quickly got up to speed, he continued.ldquoWe got sloppy towards the end but overall we were very happy with today.Down now look ahead to the weekend when they face off against Meath following their win over Westmeath.Mayo: R Hennelly E Hession, O Mullin , L Keegan M Plunkett , P Durcan, R Brickenden M Ruane , D OrsquoConnorF McDonagh , K McLoughlin, J FlynnT Conroy , C OrsquoConnor , R OrsquoDonoghue .Subs used: E McLaughlinfor Brickenden, B Walsh for FlynnC Loftus for McDonaghS Coen for McLoughlin, A Orme for OrsquoDonoghue , J McCormack for D OrsquoConnor , C Boyle for Keegan .Down: R Burns G Collins, G McGovern, P Murdock K McKernan, P Laverty, J Flynn R McEvoy, C Mooney J Guinness , C Poland, C Doherty D Guinness , C Quinn , B OrsquoHagan .Subs used: L Kerrfor DohertyO McCabe for PolandD OrsquoHagan for McKernanP Devlinfor McKernan, L Middleton for Quinn, S McConvillefor McEvoyB McArdle for Murdock Mayo -Down -NFL DIVISION .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Tohear.jpg","title":"To hear Hugh was a ‘peacemaker’ was very touching  ","story":"GERALDINE McGrattan was  and away on a holiday in Tralee when she first heard that her beloved uncle, Fr Hugh Mullan, had been shot dead in Ballymurphy in Belfast on August , .The tragic news was confirmed to her grandparents, John and Mary Mullan, around am the following day.Her mother Teresa, Hughrsquos eldest sister, was pregnant at the time and Geraldine could not wait to get home to Portaferry.ldquoGranny was distraught, I arrived home late on the Tuesday evening as it took so long and to get through the Newry border checkpoint, she recalled.ldquoIt was so unbelievable, I picked up a paper in Dublin to read what had happened. My uncle was the first to be shot, then Frank Quinn, the  year-old, who was shot beside him and killed.What hurt Geraldine and the wider Mullan family so much was in press reports Fr Mullan was said to have been involved in a gun battle with soldiers.ldquoHe was such a big part of our family le, for the lies that were told about him were very dficult for us all, she said. ldquoIt was hard enough to lose him, but to lose him like that and then everything afterward was so hard.She said on that fateful day, her uncle had been trying all day to calm things down.ldquoThere was trouble from Loyalists behind Springfield Park and the people in Springfield Park started to evacuate their houses and tried to flee across a piece of waste ground over to Moyard to safety.ldquoBricks and stones were being thrown at their houses and houses were badly damaged. They were carrying children across the waste ground and firing started. A man, Bobby Clarke, was shot and wounded in a field and local people called for a priest as they thought he was going to die.ldquoUncle Hugh had been standing outside his own house and had spent the day ringing the Army, trying to get thing quietened and calmed. He called the Army to tell them that he was going out to the wasteland to help an injured man. Then he got a white cloth, began to wave it and went out onto the wasteland.ldquoHe got to Bobby and he told Uncle Hugh he wasnrsquot too bad. Uncle Hugh said he would go and get him an ambulance but would give him the Anointing of the Sick to help him anyway.ldquoHe did that and he was making his way back to get an ambulance when he was shot. He was shot at least twice and left in the field. Frank Quinn went out to help Uncle Hugh and he was shot and died instantly.The family never received any official explanation about Fr Mullanrsquos death.ldquoIn the early days, we were told that Uncle Hugh had been killed in crossfire during a gun battle, said Mrs McGrattan. ldquoNewspapers reported that he was a gunman, carrying a weapon. No one ever contacted us, there was never a person at the door to tell us what had happened.Along with the joy from last Tuesday of the coronerrsquos ruling that Fr Mullan was an innocent, Mrs McGrattan said there was also a lot of sadness for her.ldquoIt was a sad day as my grandparents, John and Mary, werenrsquot there to hear it, nor were my parents, Teresa and Gerry, my husband Gerard and my brother Hugh Kearney. So many of us have died in those  years and didnrsquot get to hear the good words she used.There was another loss for her family mdash her mother Teresarsquos baby died at birth and her parents moved to England shortly afterwards.Mrs McGrattan said she was really moved to hear the testimonies of civilian witnesses who gave evidence during the inquest.ldquoWhenever Mrs Justice Keegan said that Hughrsquos story was stark and in her opinion, he was a peacemaker, and totally innocent, it lted a weight off me.ldquoIrsquove known for the past  years that Hugh was innocent but now the world knows. To hear him call him a peacemaker was very touching. It was though that I had been coiled up in a tight spring and suddenly just released. It was a great day.She praised and thanked the Portaferry community for their support over the years.ldquoThe people of Portaferry were so generous and so kind to the whole family at that time, actually all through the years.

Access should only be restrictedany confidential information is discussed. If any person considers that access to meetings is being restricted unnecessarily, their first step should be to approach the council with these concerns.But access remained denied, so the Minister was asked to amend legislation around this sticking point.A spokesperson replied: ldquoGiven legislation currently allows public press access to committees and subcommittees subject to the exclusions previously advised, the Department is not at this time considering making amendments.This was shared with councillors, with all who replied commenting positively around press attendance.Councillor Barry McElduff, Sinn Fein formally called for press to be permitted access to Health Group meetings and Chief Executive Alison McCullagh suggested this could be achieved by upgrading to subcommittee status.Following unanimous agreement in December, BBC Local Democracy enquired when this could be expected, and were advised it was part of an ongoing review.The matter arose last week, and what started out as a victory for democracy, quickly dwindled when members learned upgrading meant quota rules of membership would apply.Councillor Emmet McAleer, Independent suggested retaining working group status, but opening meetings to public and press, but the Chair Councillor Stephen McCann replied: ldquoThat conversation has been had a number of times and we are aware why that cannot happen. However it was given extra clout as a subcommittee, I understand the press would have access. That would address some concerns members have raised in the past.The Chief Executive stressed: ldquoThe only dference is Standing Orders apply in subcommittees, therefore press and public would have normal access.Current Health Group member Councillor Donal OrsquoCofaigh, Independent, acknowledged subcommittee status would cost him his place under the quota, but nonetheless was willing to agreeit meant public and press access.SDLP Councillor Mary Garrity said: ldquoIf itrsquos not legislatively enforceable, we come upon this quandary, whether we like it or not.However she felt working group status meant reporting back to full council and: ldquoAbsent the press, we would still get all our concerns highlighted.The Chief Executive confirmed: ldquoActions would be reported, irrespective of working group or subcommittee status.Councillor Josephine Deehan, Independent found it: ldquoRegrettable we didnrsquot have information regarding legislative requirements prior to making this decision. Irsquom concerned that members of small parties and independents would be excluded. I strongly believe in inclusion and as elected members we have a duty to represent our constituents.She added: ldquoTherersquos not a huge amount of dference between a subcommittee and a working group. In terms of involving the press and public, we would have the opportunity to raise issues at standing committees.Proposing retention of the current working group status to ensure inclusivity and current membership, Councillor Deehan said: ldquoThe only dference is access to the public and press hellipRepresentation and input from members is more important and should be the greater priority.This was seconded by Councillor Garrity.Councillor McElduff requested clarity around press access noting: ldquoObviously where possible, when we arenrsquot talking about issues which are confidential, wersquod want to err on the side of openness and transparency.The Chief Executive pointed to legislation in which: ldquoThere is no provision for press or public to attend working group meetings.Councillor Adam Gannon, SDLP noted the Health Group was: ldquoLooked at to change into a subcommittee because some members wanted it opened to the press. Whilst it would be nice to have public access to everything, it may not always happen and canrsquot always be that way.Concluding the discussion, he said whatever the status of the group: ldquoThe work is still being done. It would be nice for the public to be present, but we donrsquot need the press there to do our work. I know I donrsquot.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They also require a dense tree line for their flight path,” Mr Greer said.Anyone who hasinformation or advice on these rare, protected animals and their migratory patterns is welcome to get in touch, he added.Kilwaughter Minerals Ltd, which owns one of the banks of the lake, said it had lowered the water level in accordance with recommendations from the Department for Infrastructure.The Department said recently: “KilwaughterMinerals Limited are the reservoir manager forKilwaughterPond. In common with other reservoir managers they have a responsibility to ensure the safe condition of their reservoir in line with their common law responsibilities.

Secondly, there will not be another border poll for at least another  years, unless nationalist parties win the popular vote outright in an election.Understandably, some unionists will be fearful about actively calling for a border poll. But such concern must be balanced against the following three factors. Firstly, Irish nationalism is pushing strongly for a referendum within this decade. If unionists are to going to have to face such a poll in the near future then they must seek to control its timing.Secondly, the NI protocol has already blatantly violated the principle of consent and is in the process of creating an all-Ireland economy. Both these factors will inevitably to lead to Irish unitynot challenged.Thirdly, a referendum will force Alliance Green Party voters to take a more definitive position on the constitutional question. Given the social-economic benefits of remaining in the UK, this would most probably favour unionism, at this point in time. The government could of course deny such a referendum. In such circumstances, unionists would not be in any worse position constitutionally by collapsing the Assembly, than that which the Irish Sea border has already imposed upon them. Those parties that supported the protocol would face the sanction of losing their assembly seats and salaries. This may force some of them to take a more balanced approach to unionist concerns. Crucially, Sinn Fein would also be denied their long term objective of being in government in both parts of the island. The new leaders of unionism need to start their reigns by asking themselves how they want be remembered in history.

He was just one of a kind and will be sorely missed.     Stuart was a good family man. He married Janet, a NHS nurse, and they had a wonderful daughter Rhinna, whom he absolutely adored.Sadly, during the last couple of years his health had deteriorated, though he made brave efforts to carry on trying to help the struggling rugby club. At the end of October he had a stroke while driving his car and ended up in hospital, where the Covid- lockdown prevented him from seeing his family for several months, which left him very upset and both Janet and Rhinna heartbroken. ldquoHe lost ten stones in weight and seemed to have aged  years in  days, explained his daughter.Thankfully, he was determined to see his loved ones and say goodbye, as Rhinna explained, so he resolutely battled against the odds, making sure he was able to see them by the end of April when the lockdown was relaxed.ldquoHe has waited for us,\" said Rhinna. \"We went to see him and mum said that he was waiting for us and his brother Keith to say goodbye.There is very little doubt Penarth RFC will never be the same without Stu Davies. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are also around  to  cases of the India iant in parts of Scotland, including Glasgow, with these cases again connected to travel.The India Covid iant, officially known as B.., was first detected in India in October.It has been designated a ldquoiant of concern by PHE as it is thought to be at least as transmissible as the iant detected in Kent last year, known as B, which is now dominant in the UK.PHE said there is currently no evidence to suggest that the new Indian iant is more serious than previous mutations, nor is there evidence which indicates that this version of the Indian iant is resistant to current vaccines.Health experts said they ldquohavenrsquot seen any hint of a current Covid iant that can fully evade the effectiveness of vaccines.On Wednesday , the European Medicines Agency said it was ldquopretty confident that vaccines currently in use will be effective against the Indian iant, a view that has been echoed by some British scientists.However, Professor James Naismith from the University of Oxford said not enough is known to say for sure whether the iant could frustrate the UKrsquos vaccination programme.Speaking on BBC Radio rsquos Today programme, he said: ldquoThe vaccines donrsquot  per cent prevent infection for people.ldquoWhat they do is, they almost  per cent prevent hospitalisation and serious illness.ldquoWe donrsquot know enough to know yet whether the Indian strain will behave dferently than that.ldquoSo even the regular virus can infect people who have been vaccinated and sometimes you do get reinfection.Could the iant delay lockdown ending The growing number of India Covid iant cases in the UK has sparked concerns that the lting of lockdown restrictions, which is set for  June in England, could now be delayed.Ministers have also not ruled out re-introducing local lockdowns in areas where the iant of concern is increasing.Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said that the government will make decisions based on the data, and measures will be eased ldquoat a pace and in a way which is safe.Symptoms to look forThe main symptoms of coronavirus to look for include:a high temperature ndash this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back a new, continuous cough ndash this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing episodes in  hours a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste ndash this means youve noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste dferent to normalMost people with symptoms have at least one of these symptoms, although some do not experience any.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt was girl power when ten female walkers joined Joy and sheepdog Bracken from Penarth and District Ramblers at Penarth clftop for an . mile walk, with no stiles only gates and which would see them experiencing the weather of all four seasons in one day. They set off on a socially distanced walk in lovely spring sunshine across the old pitch and putt course before joining part of the old railway line, now a walk and cycle way, and heading through a built up area Lavernock Road led them into Cosmeston Country Park.Past the eastern lake with its floating jetty where canoes can be safely launched and making their way through the eastern paddock with its carpet of pretty cowslips, open meadows led them towards Old Cogan Hall Farm, where they deviated into the churchyard of St Peterrsquos for morning break in glorious warm sunshine reminiscent of summer. Admiring the herring bone masonry which dates to Celtic and Saxon times and the ancient yew trees that could even pre-date this lovely old church, which allegedly is the oldest building in Penarth and hearing some of its long and interesting history, it fell into disrepair in the th century. By the th century the ruinous building was a cattle shelter until the latter part of the rsquos when the rd Marquis of Bute was persuaded to pay for its renovation.Mile Road built by the Bute family led them to the western paddock and through the sun-dappled Cogan Wood to re-enter fields where a footbridge led them across the Sully Brook for the short climb up to Home Farm, with its glorious views towards the eastern end of Barry and the surrounding farmland. Exiting through a gate, some road walking in a southerly direction brought them into Sully village and pounding pavements to reach the Jubilee Hall and the cricket field, the full beauty of Sully Bay with its views across the Bristol Channel towards the Somerset coastline and Hayes Point to the west confronted them.     With the wind beginning to pick up they tramped by track and field to the public slipway at Sully beach and stopped for lunch utilising rocks for seating whilst gazing eastwards towards Sully Island and Flat and Steep Holm beyond, as clouds thickened overhead and the temperature dropped making it feel more like autumn.Time to move on along part of the long distance Wales Coast Path, through the playing fields to exit onto Beach Road, following it to the car park of the Captainrsquos We where there were only a few people sitting at outdoor tables for food and drink, not really enjoyable in the cool breeze.The fairly quiet St Maryrsquos Well Bay Road brought them up past The Bay Caravan Park and into fields with growing crops where, without any warning a sudden short sharp shower of rain engulfed the group forcing coats to be swtly donned.Crossing a wooden footbridge into the delightful Lavernock Nature Reserve the grassy path led them into the remains of the WW gun emplacements. Initially in the late rsquos the original Lavernock Gun Battery was built to protect the Bristol and Cardf shipyards and the Bristol Channel, but unfortunately most of the original buildings now lie underneath the caravan park.Being bombarded by a short hail storm whilst moving on through the nature reserve, lovingly cared for by volunteers and passing the man-made pond with its surrounding carpet of bluish violet bugle, a plant which attracts moths, butterflies and bees, before exiting onto Fort Road their route led them past the Marconi Holiday Village and the Church of St Lawrence before heading along the clftop. With thick black clouds heading up the English side of the Bristol Channel, the race was on to get back before the rain hit. As the weather turned wintry and the wind increased, a huge shower of hailstones and heavy rain struck them on the open Penarth clftop soaking them as they made their way back to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits before, during and after lockdown on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I think the Secretary of State for Health is certainly one of those people.ldquoI said repeatedly to the Prime Minister that he should be fired, so did the cabinet secretary, so did many other senior people.Sir Mark Sedwill was the cabinet secretary until September , a period which covered the first phase of the pandemic.Mr Hancock was lined up to lead a coronavirus press conference from Downing Street on Thursday as he rejected Mr Cummingsrsquo allegations.ldquoWe absolutely reject Mr Cummingsrsquo claims about the Health Secretary, a spokesman for Mr Hancock said.ldquoThe Health Secretary will continue to work closely with the Prime Minister to deliver the vaccine rollout, tackle the risks posed by iants and support the NHS and social care sector to recover from this pandemic.He insisted the Health Secretary had ldquoworked incredibly hard in unprecedented circumstances to protect the NHS and save lives.Mr Hancock will appear before the same committee where the series of hard-hitting allegations were levelled on June .Mr Cummings has previously described Mr Hancockrsquos department as a ldquosmoking ruin which could not cope with the demands of the pandemic.On the claim that Mr Hancock lied, Mr Cummings said: ldquoThere are numerous examples.ldquoIn the summer he said that everybody who needed treatment got the treatment they required. He knew that that was a lie because he had been briefed by the chief scientic adviser and the chief medical officer himself about the first peak.ldquoWe were told explicitly people did not get the treatment they deserved, many people were left to die in horric circumstances.Mr Hancock had also blamed NHS chief Sir Simon Stevens and Chancellor Rishi Sunak for PPE problems.Mr Cummings said he asked the cabinet secretary to investigate, who came back and said ldquoit is completely untrue, I have lost confidence in the Secretary of Statersquos honesty in these meetings.The former aide said Mr Hancockrsquos public promise to deliver , tests a day by the end of April was ldquoincredibly stupid because it was already an internal goal.ldquoIn my opinion he shouldrsquove been fired for that thing alone, and that itself meant the whole of April was hugely disrupted by dferent parts of Whitehall fundamentally trying to operate in dferent ways completely because Hancock wanted to be able to go on TV and say lsquolook at me and my k targetrsquo.ldquoIt was criminal, disgraceful behaviour that caused serious harm.Accusing Mr Hancock of ldquoappalling behaviour towards Prof Whitty and Sir Patrick, Mr Cummings said: ldquoHe used the whole lsquowersquore following the sciencersquo as a way so that he could always say, lsquowellthings go wrong, wersquoll blame the scientists and itrsquos not my faultrsquo.He suggested Mr Johnson kept Mr Hancock in place because he was told ldquoyou should keep him there because hersquos the person you fire when the inquiry comes along.At Prime Ministerrsquos Questions, Mr Johnson was asked whether the cabinet secretary had ldquolost faith in the Health Secretaryrsquos honesty.Mr Johnson said: ldquoThe answer to that is lsquonorsquo and Irsquom afraid I havenrsquot had the benefit of seeing the evidence that he is bringing to the House, but I must say that I think what the people of this country want us all to do is to get on with the delicate business now of trying to reopen our economy and restore peoplersquos freedoms, get back to our way of le by rolling out the vaccine.PressedMr Johnson still has confidence in the Health Secretary, the Prime Ministerrsquos official spokesman said: ldquoYes, the Health Secretary has been working closely with the Prime Minister throughout and has been fully focused on protecting the health and care system and saving lives..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Matt Hancock has not seen Cummings u  uperformance u in full article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
