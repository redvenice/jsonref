Mr Hunt\u0027s breaches relate to seven flats he bought in the Ocean Village complex in Southampton (pictured) in FebruarySir Alistair Graham, a former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, told the Daily Telegraph, which revealed the oversight: \u0027It is a very poor show when ministers, who you expect to take leadership in standards ... do not meet the rules they are required to meet.\u0027If there has been a failure of leadership, there should be a political price for it. Either in terms of the damage to your reputation or to action by the Prime Minister in the case of the Ministerial Code, or by the Committee on Standards.\u0027Mr Hunt\u0027s breaches relate to seven flats he bought in the Ocean Village complex in Southampton in February. The average price paid for properties in the development is £240,000 per flat, according to Zoopla.          The oversight is a criminal offence punishable by a fine or up to two years in prisonThe mortgages were issued by a private bank to Mare Pond Properties Limited, a company set up by Mr Hunt and his wife Lucia Guo. Miss Guo was the only person named in the registration documents filed at Companies House when the firm was incorporated in September 2017. Mr Hunt appears to have breached the Companies Act on two counts. He should have declared to Companies House he was a \u0027person with significant control\u0027 within 28 days of registration. But he did not do so for six months.Legislation passed by the Tories in 2016 made this compulsory for anyone who has more than 25 per cent of shares or voting rights in a company. The law was a central part of the Government\u0027s plan to tackle money laundering, and failure to comply is an offence punishable by a fine or up to two years in prison.The second breach relates to the fact Mr Hunt\u0027s name was omitted from the registration document – a criminal offence under another section of the Companies Act. Parliamentary rules state MPs must register any shareholding greater than 15 per cent in any company within 28 days. But Mr Hunt took nearly five months to do so, registering his co-ownership of the company alongside the purchase of the flats in the Register of MPs\u0027 Interests on March 7.He told the Telegraph the breaches were down to an honest mistake by his accountant and that he had corrected the listing after being alerted to it by a member of the public on March 28.           Mr Hunt has not breached the Ministerial Code of Conduct with the Ocean Village breach, according to Cabinet Office rules, and so retains the backing of Theresa MayHis spokesman said: \u0027These were honest administrative mistakes which have already been rectified. \u0027Jeremy\u0027s accountant made an error in the Companies House filing which was a genuine oversight.\u0027The Cabinet Office are clear that there has been no breach of the ministerial code. Jeremy declared the interest to them after the company was set up. \u0027They advised that as it was a shell company with no assets or value, it should only be registered when it became operational. \u0027As such, Jeremy presumed the same rules applied to Parliamentary declarations ... Jeremy accepts these mistakes are his responsibility and has apologised to the parliamentary authorities.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/13/04/4B19998A00000578-0-image-a-26_1523591770915.jpg","title":"Meghan Markle Chicago airport incognito finalize UK visa","story":"    Meghan Markle landed in Chicago\u0027s O\u0027Hare International Airport on Thursday morning to finalize her UK visa application          She was spotted walking through the airport in a White Sox baseball cap in an attempt to remain incognitoOne source said that Chicago police provided security for Meghan but did not give her an actual escort as she went through the airport. According to TMZ, Meghan entered the VFS Global UK Visa Application Centre in Chicago Thursday to finalize her application after she landed in the city. Meghan is set to attend key Commonwealth Youth Forum event...Meghan Markle is blasted by her sister for \u0027inviting...Share this articleThe entire process took about 10 minutes where staff cleared the office for her while she filled out the paperwork. Meghan reportedly paid an estimated $1,500 or more to have the visa expedited so she can receive in the next couple of days. This comes just one month before she is due at the alter to marry Prince Harry. They are scheduled to be wed at Windsor Castle on May 19 and more than 2,500 people have been invited to attend the event. The future wife to Prince Harry appears to be crossing some to-do items off her list before the ceremony.             Meghan reportedly had the Chicago visa office cleared out so she could finalize her visa.

The Roskomnadzor telecoms watchdog, which brought the case, had earlier demanded the service be blocked as soon as the verdict was announced (pictured, activists in St Petersburg)In September 2017 the FSB security service demanded encryption keys, Durov said, prompting a formal complaint when the request was rejected.Durov wrote last year that the FSB\u0027s demands are \u0027technically impossible to carry out\u0027 and violate the Russian Constitution which entitles citizens to privacy of correspondence.Roskomnadzor had threatened to ban the app in June last year for failing to join its official register, which requires companies to provide the FSB with information on user interactions.Although Telegram later registered, it stopped short of agreeing to the regulator\u0027s data storage demands.From this year, companies on the register must also store all the data of Russian users inside the country, according to controversial anti-terror legislation passed in 2016 which was decried by internet companies and the opposition.           In September 2017 the FSB security service demanded encryption keys, Durov said, prompting a formal complaint when the request was rejected (pictured: activists in St Petersburg)          Telegram is especially popular among political activists of all stripes, and is used by the Kremlin to communicate with journalists, but has also been used by jihadists"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/13/20/4B12D4F800000578-5612059-image-a-20_1523649412503.jpg","title":"UK set sunshine temperatures rivalling Med week","story":"    Dense fog lingered on Alexandra Palace in north London yesterday as the capital experienced a whole week without a single hour of sunshine          Thursday April 5 was the last time any sunny hours were recorded from the location amateur weather expert Ben Lee-Rodgers monitors on Hampstead Heath (pictured: fog in Alexandra Palace yesterday)      The Met Office says thermometers will rise gradually through the week but warned that fronts from the Atlantic, battling to move in from the west, will mean some areas of Scotland and Northern Ireland could see showers.Amateur weather expert Ben Lee-Rodgers, who is based in Hampstead, north London, said the last week is the first time the capital hasn\u0027t seen a single hour of sun for seven consecutive days since January 2010.Thursday April 5 was the last time any sunny hours were recorded from the location he monitors on Hampstead Heath.Since then the city\u0027s skies have been dull and not a single full hour of sunshine has been recorded. Met Office meteorologist Sarah Kent said: \u0027We can\u0027t comment on a single location, but there has been less sunshine than we\u0027d expect for April.Britain faces flood misery as heavy rain sweeps across...The storm before the calm!

By this point in the month the number is lower than hoped for.\u0027She added that the tussle between the warm air from the South and the wet weather in the West - which will bring rain to most places on Sunday - will finally be won by the continental influence on Monday.Ms Kent said temperatures in the south-east could hit 59F (15C) or 61F (16C) at the start of the working week.She said: \u0027By Tuesday across London we could see 18C (64F), maybe 19C (66F). By Wednesday, there\u0027s still going to be some patchy rain in parts of the north-west but England and Wales will have this continental air coming in.\u0027So, dry weather for them, plenty of sunshine again. Temperatures on Wednesday will again be highest in the South East. London could see between 20C and 23C.             \u0027And in fact, going further north, places like York could see 18C to 20c. And, even for Glasgow, it could be 17C or 18C on Wednesday.\u0027Ms Kent said: \u0027The trend into the end of the week is to continue this feed of warmer continental air across England and Wales. \u0027Those frontal systems are always trying to battle into the north-west, so it could be cloudier there with some more mixed weather at times.\u0027But, by the end of the week, in the that far south-eastern corner we could see temperatures into the low to mid-20s.\u0027Ms Kent said that these temperatures will be above the average for mid April. She said London will normally expect to see levels of 55F (13C) to 57F (14C) at this time of year with an average of 54F (12C) to 55F (13C) normal for southern England.The Met Office said Saturday is likely to be the best day of the coming weekend, with temperatures reaching the mid to high teens in some places.But Sunday will see rain at times across much of Britain as the country braces itself for the sun to come.

They now have two young children.The relationship between father and daughter has now fractured so badly they are facing each other across a courtroom, arguing over ownership of a flat in London, a house in Surrey, cash from four properties in the USA and 23 items of jewellery which belonged to Mrs Wamsteker’s dead mother, said to be worth about £1million in total.Judge Simon Monty QC, at Central London County Court, heard that Mrs Wamsteker, who lives in Canary Wharf, East London, has been practicing law in London for 17 years and previously worked for accounting giants Ernst and Young.Her father, who lives in Stratford, East London, told the court that he is also a qualified lawyer.The pair had always been close in their personal and financial lives, sharing a mutually \u0027loving and generous\u0027 relationship as the family built up a portfolio of properties across London, the USA and Malaysia.But that was before rows over their respective choice of partners following the death of Mrs Wamsteker’s mother - Mr David’s first wife - in 2008, tore the family apart.When her widowed father \u0027formed an attachment to and subsequently married\u0027 her  nanny, Mrs Wamsteker \u0027objected strongly to the relationship, describing it as ‘unthinkably repugnant’, the judge was told.Britney Spears and Will.i.am lose legal battle against...Tiger Woods embroiled in legal battle with his ex-girlfriend...Share this articleThe pensioner accepted that he \u0027doesn’t like\u0027 his daughter’s husband, 52-year-old investment director Adrianus Wamsteker, but denied accusations that he had previously threatened him with an axe.The father and daughter’s dislike of each other’s partners, and particularly Mr David’s marriage to her au pair, \u0027has resulted in the wholesale breakdown of the close relationship between them,\u0027 Mrs Wamsteker’s barrister, Desmond Kilcoyne, told the judge.\u0027The existing litigation is now motivated by a high degree of animosity by Mr David towards his daughter and particularly her husband,\u0027 he added.The English properties at stake in the case are a four-bedroom detached bungalow in Salisbury Road, Worcester Park, Surrey, previously marketed for £740,000, and a flat in Selsdon Road, West Ham, East London, worth about £275,000.Mr David says that he is the \u0027beneficial owner\u0027 of both properties - despite them being in his daughter’s name - having stumped up the deposits for them both and either \u0027funded\u0027 or made \u0027contributions\u0027 to their mortgages.          Audra Wamsteker, 49, and her husband Adrianus Wamsteker are pictured outside court as she battles her father for her dead mother\u0027s jewellery and international property portfolio As well as a declaration that he owns the properties, Mr David wants his daughter to pay him around £150,000 in rent for having \u0027excluded\u0027 him from the house and the flat since 2013.He also claims he paid for four properties in Florida which were sold in 2014 and is now \u0027entitled to the proceeds of sale\u0027, which Mrs Wamsteker currently holds.Finally Mr David is demanding his daughter return to him 23 items of his late first wife’s jewellery.Mr Kilcoyne, for Mrs Wamsteker, told the judge that she denies her father has ever owned any of the properties.She also refuses to give up her late mother’s jewellery as she says it was \u0027a gift\u0027 by her father before their relationship broke down.Mr David, who is representing himself and is backed by his son Alvin - also a qualifed lawyer - told the judge from the witness box that the jewellery, along with a box of her deceased mother’s clothes, \u0027were not given to her, but taken to her house for safekeeping\u0027.Mr Kilcoyne pointed to emails he said proved the gift had been made, in one of which Mr David told his daughter: \u0027It’s no use keeping something you’ve been given by someone you hate so bitterly.\u0027But Mr David told the judge he gave Mrs Wamsteker only one item - \u0027a gold chain with pearls on it\u0027 - plus another item to her daughter, and she had wrongfully kept the rest.Mr Kilcoyne told Mr David: \u0027There have been a number of arrangements between you and your daughter, at the end of which arrangements she owns property. You gave that jewellery to her and now you want it back.\u0027\u0027Nothing has been given away,\u0027 he responded.Telling the judge about the close relationship he used to enjoy with his daughter, Mr David said: \u0027She told me, mummy made me swear that I’d look after you to your dying day.’Mr Kilcoyne agreed there used to be a \u0027very close bond\u0027 between them, adding: \u0027You said your daughter thinks of you like a god.\u0027But there had been a darker side to their relationship, the barrister claimed.\u0027There’s an aspect of the relationship where she has felt unable to say no to you...she says you used to badger her for money...you felt entitled to ask her for money. You demanded money, you badgered her for money,\u0027 he put to Mr David.The pensioner denied the allegations saying: \u0027She makes me look like some sort of gangster...I look like a horrible man standing here.\u0027I still love both my children,\u0027 he told the judge.Mr Kilcoyne also alleged that Mr David had threatened his daughter’s husband with an axe. \u0027You told her you would destroy her and kill her husband,\u0027 he said. Mr David replied: \u0027No. The axe was in my bedroom drawer. If I had approached him with an axe like she says, I would have hurt him. That’s true I dislike him. I don’t deny it, I don’t like him.\u0027I realised what he was when he married my daughter in 2004. She’s got a very greedy husband,\u0027 he told the judge.Alvin David, Mrs Wamsteker’s brother and Mr David’s son, who lives in New Maldon with his family, outside court valued the property, jewellery and money claims being brought by his father against his sister at around £1m. The hearing continues. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/12/08/04D7E4AB000007D0-0-image-m-5_1523518559531.jpg","title":"Horrific moment female worker","story":"\u0027Guardian angel\u0027: Alexander Vysotsky is being hailed as a hero in Russia after he stepped in to save 28-year-old Ekaterina, right, from an \u0027attempted rape\u0027 The footage shows the victim bravely resisting, backing away towards the door and even grabbing the blade of the knife.He is seen forcing her  to the ground and pulling at her skirt. We\u0027ve got a dossier too!

Fortunately the guides had drilled it into our heads that if anything happens, don\u0027t run, don\u0027t run!\u0027After about an hour-and-a-half we came out of forest and looked up and about 100 metres away saw an elephant at the top of a little hill. \u0027We stopped immediately admired it and then suddenly it charged us.\u0027Mr Larsen continued: \u0027Dean our lead guide said, \u0027Don\u0027t move!\u0027, so we stood there frozen in terror as the elephant charged down the hill at us.\u0027 I\u0027m a pretty calm person. I don\u0027t yell and scream in a car crash. But I was scared to death.\u0027Straight away Dean had moved forward and become the target. He put his arm up and yelled \u0027Whoooa!\u0027 and about 10 metres away the elephant stopped dead in its tracks. \u0027It was unbelievable. It looked like something out of a cartoon. His front feet dug into the ground in a cloud of dust. I could not believe what I was seeing.\u0027With his right arm raised Dean was loudly commanding the elephant and it backed off. It was surreal. And what impressed me is that Dean didn\u0027t raise his rifle once. \u0027He was as cool a cucumber confronting a charging bull that looked really mad with us.           Calm before the storm: Ms Shi poses with guides Phanny Risimati, left, and Mr Oellofse, right, in Kruger National Park          Out and about: Video filmed by Mr Larson shows the group trudging through grass before their encounter with the angry elephant \u0027This bloke stepped up to the mark and without hesitation and no fear put his body on the line and took control.\u0027The elephant charged twice more and again and again Dean stopped it in its tracks.\u0027After the first charge Lulu and I backed up slowly with the other guide to a nearby tree. \u0027And as soon as we got to it the elephant charged again. You could see it was angry and meant business.\u0027After the third time the elephant moved off and all I could think of then was get us out of here.\u0027I watched it, relieved, and thought I looked like a child stomping off because Dean hadn\u0027t let it get its own way. \u0027It was flapping its ears and throwing sand over its back. I think it was really cheesed off.

San Francisco does have a 420 code, but it refers to ‘juvenile disturbance’, a tenuous connection at best. The California penal code does have a 420 section, but it refers to the unlawful prevention or obstruction of a person from entering public land.As for the births and deaths of musical luminaries: Bob Marley died on May 11 Joplin died in October Morrison in July Hendrix in September. Even the chemical composition for cannabis is out, coming in at 483 known compounds.          There are many theories regarding the provenance of the term 420 including that it\u0027s the police code for \u0027marijuana smoking in progress\u0027, though most have been debunkedHowever, that is not to say the most legitimate-sounding provenance is disappointing or in any way less delightful than the theories above.The term 420, quite appositely, is thought to have been created by a group of high school students looking to arrange a time to meet up, smoke marijuana and search for plot of land grow more of the cannabis plant.According to High Times, the cannabis magazine, in 1971 five students at the San Rafael High School in California decided to meet every day at 4.20pm to smoke marijuana by the school’s statue of Louis Pasteur. The password for the meeting was ‘420 Louis’. The five students called themselves ‘the Waldos’. The magazine then says the term faded into obscurity only to gloriously be brought back by a connection to the Grateful Dead band, at whose shows mysterious 420 flyers began popping up.In 1998, High Times officially declared the Waldos as the true creators of the term 420.Cannabis laws in the UKCannabis in the UK is classified as a Class B drug, alongside amphetamines like speed and certain opioids.People stopped for possession of cannabis for the first time get a written warning. A second offence may result in an on-the-spot fine while a third stop will result in an arrest.The maximum penalty for possession of cannabis is up to five years in prison, an unlimited fine or both.          Though recreational cannabis isn\u0027t legal in the UK, many people smoke it in Hyde Park on 420Cannabis laws in the USThe tide against smoking of marijuana is slowly turning in the US. The drug was first legalised for recreational use in the US in 2012 with Colorado and Washington states.As of April 2018, nine states and Washington DC have legalised recreational use of marijuana: California, Nevada, Maine, Massachusetts, Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and Vermont. Over half of all US states allow marijuana for medicinal use.Cannabis in AustraliaRecreational use of marijuana in Australia is currently illegal. If someone is caught in possession of marijuana, the punishments they face range from on-the-spot-fines to being charged with a criminal offence or even being sentenced to prison, depending on what state they are in. However, the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes is legal. In April 2018, the Federal Health Minister, Greg Hunt said: ‘Faster access, better access … there will be a one-stop shop for accessing medicinal cannabis,’.Britain\u0027s Got Talent 2018 Spoilers: Acts to watchHow to watch Beyonce at CoachellaCannes Film Festival 2018: Everything you need to knowBritain\u0027s Got Talent 2018: Everything you need to knowACM Awards 2018: All you need to know about the country music awardsWhat is 420 and when is \u0027weed day\u0027?Sting and Shaggy album 44876 is comingLost in Space Netflix series: Everything you need to knowThe Sandlot cast reunite 25 years on ahead of 25th anniversaryCoachella 2018: Yodelling Walmart kid Mason Ramsey could perform with Post MaloneEndometriosis: What is it, what are the symptoms and how can it be treated?"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/13/19/4B205DE800000578-5613363-Football_mad_Seth_poses_with_Doncaster_Rovers_forward_Alfie_May_-m-12_1523645386903.jpg","title":"Five year old shows incredible sporting knowledge naming hundreds footballers memory","story":"    Sporting the Doncaster Rovers home kit, little Seth grins as he has his photo taken with midfielder Tommy Rowe   Football mad Seth poses with Doncaster Rovers forward Alfie May at Keepmoat Stadium in Doncaster  The five-year-old (pictured left in Paris Saint Germain kit and right in his school uniform) regularly trounces his father when they go head to head in a game of FIFAThe 34-year-old added: \u0027One night I decided to make him a football quiz of name the face.\u0027I saved 100 footballers pictures and he named every single one first time.

Occasionally, she’ll be a-ish if she’s asked to do anything she doesn’t want to. On one shoot, she had to wear a silly Christmas hat and I could tell she wasn’t best pleased.She does this thing where it sounds like she’s muttering under her breath. When she had the hat on, she turned to one of the young boys sitting next to her and ‘muttered’. It was hilarious.And sometimes she likes to keep people waiting to get that great shot. She’ll wait until everyone is about to take a break or pack up and then she’ll do her favourite move of standing on her hind legs and putting her paws on the model’s shoulders. The photographer is always grabbing his camera at that point.Iraida is particularly beautiful and clients love the fact that she’s such an unusual colour.

Roo, a five-year-old Dalmation, lives with Stephen Smythe, 65, a retired company director, and his wife, Carola, 63, in Central LondonIt wasn’t the first time that someone had told us we had a good-looking dog. It was my daughter who suggested I sign her up to a modelling agency. She’s done a variety of campaigns for brands such as Cath Kidston, Sainbury’s and McDonald’s. Photographers tell us that her contrasting markings make her very attractive: she’s not too black and not too white.The Cath Kidston shoot was particularly crazy because it involved more than 30 dogs recreating a scene from 101 Dalmations to promote a range of black and white clothes. Funnily enough, Roo’s grandmother actually starred as one of the 101 dogs in the 1996 version of the film.Roo took it all in her stride and we even bumped into her brother, which was a rather sweet moment.We don’t treat her as any kind of superstar: she’s simply our family pet who we treat occasionally to the odd grooming session at the vet. She’s well-behaved on shoots, apart from the time she had a little accident on the floor of a studio.It was my fault as I’d been rushing around all morning and had forgotten to let her do her business.Another time, she vomited after eating a huge bowl of food that was being photographed alongside her.

He lives with Bronia Pearce, 33, a professional dancer, in Reading, Berkshire. Bronia says:It was actor Shane Ritchie who first made Archie a star. I was appearing in panto with him and it was around the time that Pudsey the dog had won Britain’s Got Talent. Shane thought it would be funny to ‘do a Pudsey’ and get Archie to perform ‘tricks’ with him. Shane would then swap him for a toy dog and pretend that Archie was flying across the stage. The children in the audience couldn’t believe their eyes, but the adults were in fits of laughter.          Archie is an eight-year-old West Highland terrier. He lives with Bronia Pearce, 33, a professional dancer, in Reading, BerkshireAfterwards, I sent Archie’s details off to the PetLondon modelling agency. He did a huge campaign for the pet charity PDSA last Christmas and his face was plastered all over the Tube and railway stations, and he was on television, too.We get around six jobs a year and every time we are booked for a shoot I ask if the client wants his fur long or short. Some people like them to look a bit fluffier.We give him a bath before each shoot, which he enjoys, and use a lovely coconut shampoo on him so his fur comes out ice-white.Once, when we did a shoot for Boden, we had to travel to London in the pouring rain and arrived with Archie looking like a drowned rat. The styling team thought it was hilarious that he sat there, quite happily, while I used a hairdryer on him and he fluffed up in no time.Terriers are often quite excitable but Archie’s a professional and he’ll often fall asleep while waiting to be called. I keep bits of chicken with me to encourage him to behave.If I use the word ‘Walk’, he will tilt his head in a very cute way. Sometimes he’s booked for jobs simply for that tilt of the head.  \u0027It was actor Shane Ritchie who first made Archie a star.

He lives with owner Nicola Kazan, 33, a dog groomer, her husband Tufik, 33, a tailor, and son Theo, five, in Eton, Berkshire. Nicola says:Edward definitely knows he’s different to other dogs. He has a cool confidence about him as if to say: ‘I’m better than you’. There are not many red poodles in the UK, particularly in this apricot shade, so it’s no wonder he feels special.He’s a stud dog from the Czech Republic and originally belonged to my friend. One of her other poodles didn’t get on with Edward, so I asked if I could have him. He’s loving, intelligent and likes to be the centre of attention.Someone at ITV needed a red poodle for a show and got in touch after seeing Edward’s picture on Instagram. I then contacted the Urban Paws agency.          Edward definitely knows he’s different to other dogs. He has a cool confidence about him as if to say: ‘I’m better than you’Edward loved modelling from the very start. He’s appeared in various fashion campaigns, but the most high-profile is Stella McCartney.It was the Chinese Year of the Dog and her team wanted beautiful dogs to model her clothes. I’d never dressed Edward up in any outfits, but I said we’d give it a go.Edward couldn’t get enough of the fuss and attention. At one stage, he had two stylists preening and primping him and was wearing a gold dress that was easily worth more than £1,000.Then something caught his eye and he started racing around the studio. My heart stopped. I thought he’d ruin the dress — but he soon calmed down and we got some gorgeous shots.Once a week, I will shampoo and condition him, then dry him and make sure there are no knots. It takes around 45 minutes each time and he loves being brushed. He stands still like a statue.The money he earns varies, but usually it’s around £400 a day. I’m not allowed to say how much we were paid for the Stella job but I used £200 of it to treat Edward to a teeth-cleaning session at the vet.  Edward is a four-year-old miniature ‘red’ poodle.

Tom Ford has pet wire fox terriers, so we think that’s the reason Humphrey was chosen.The shoot wasn’t without its stresses for me. Humphrey is just a regular dog — he doesn’t do any tricks — and I had no idea how he’d behave. But he has such a lovely temperament and immediately bonded with everyone on set.His ‘instructions’ were to follow the male model around his flat as he got dressed for a night out, but at one stage Humphrey had to sit still. To keep him in one place, I had to hide behind the sofa, holding my hand out and saying: ‘Stay, Humphrey, stay.’ Thankfully, he did.At one point, he had to follow the model to the door when the doorbell rang. I didn’t think he’d do it, but he did — and got a round of applause from the team.Dogs are supposed to know their place, but now that he’s a high-end fashion model, I think Humphrey may get ideas above his station.Archie, Roo and Iraida provided by PetLondon – www.petlondonmodels.com   \u0027Ever since Humphrey was a puppy we’ve been stopped in the street by strangers asking if they can take his photograph.

It makes sense: more than four in five Australians live within easy walking or driving distance of the sea. As writer Anna Funder recently said of those who call the driest continent on Earth home: “We cling to the edge of the continent, and we swim from a very early age.”Growing up, I hated swimming – which was awful, because I didn’t just grow up in Australia, I grew up in Queensland: the sun-saturated state that gifted us Olympic gods like Kieran Perkins, Susie O’Neill, Grant Hackett and Stephanie Rice, a state where the main trade seemed to be sugar, coal and championship swimmers.You weren’t just expected to know how to swim you were expected to be good at it, too.My parents were Cantonese migrants from Hong Kong who, in the 1970s, moved to Queensland’s Sunshine Coast, home to some of the country’s most beautiful beaches. It still strikes me as a slightly baffling decision, given neither of them could swim. Water compelled and terrified them and their five Australian-born kids.While other people saw stunning coastlines, we just saw a picturesque way to die. Rips could kill you, people said. Sharks could kill you. Skin cancer could kill you. Weirdly, it was always white people who told us these things, the same white people who seemed to keep going to the beach. Were we missing something? Did they want to die?A safer option was the public pool. Years of TV safety campaigns had convinced Mum we needed to know how to swim, because she sure as hell couldn’t save us if we were drowning. Throughout summer, we’d wail as Mum drove us to the nearest suburban leisure centre for lessons. I suspect we dreaded those lessons as much as our instructors dreaded teaching us, those hopeless Asian kids spluttering with anxiety inside the enclosed training pool, those stinking hothouses of chemicals, piss and wet togs (or cossies, or bathers, or swimmers – depending on your state).After the nightmare was over, we’d be sedated with a treat – a Redskin (Australians veer towards racism even with our confectionary), an ice block or a packet of frogs – before falling asleep in the stuffy Ford Cortina, hair matted to our temples, seat belts twisted into our skin and fingers dusted orange from the Twisties we stole from each other.The horror didn’t end there. At school, not only were swimming lessons mandatory, carnivals were too – annual, school-run swim meets, ostensibly fun but deeply competitive. We even had togs in school colours that we had to buy from the uniform shop.During the lessons, I’d watch fit white kids e in and carve through water with graceful limbs that seemed custom-built for the job. Meanwhile, in Lane 1 or 6 – where I could still hold onto the wall – I’d windmill uselessly, my hands banging into the water like saucepans. There was a direct, inverse correlation between the amount of splashing I made and the distance I travelled. At swimming carnivals, all the outcasts were bunched together: the ethnic kid with no body fat (me) pale kids with lots of body fat. We had to swim in an event – any event – so we’d do the novelty race, paddling together on inflatable rafts, damp with chlorine and shame, as everyone cheered and jeered us on. But then, weirdly, I fell in love with swimming. I left home for university, moved to Brisbane and into a rambling architectural mess of a shared house. Its design was … incorrect. It attracted the heat in summer, then trapped it. During heatwaves, my flatmates and I would emerge from our rooms having barely slept and looking boiled. I took refuge from the heat at the Olympic-sized council pool at the bottom of our hill. It didn’t look like much from the outside, but inside it was pure and clean, with a panoramic view of the city skyline. I didn’t have proper togs so I swam in black boxer briefs, hoping no one would notice. After a while, I tried swimming laps.Guardian Cities is dedicating a week to exploring the opportunities and challenges of Australia\u0027s rapidly growing cities. The nation of nearly 25 million has one of the fastest-rising populations of all OECD countries, overwhelmingly focused on its biggest cities: Sydney and Melbourne. But with car dependence, urban sprawl and unaffordable housing threatening their famed liveability, are they ready for the challenge? Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Darwin and Brisbane face similar issues, while nationwide, poor indigenous consultation is a growing urban issue. Australian Cities Week, a collaboration with Guardian Australia, seeks to reveal and celebrate the culture, architecture, wildlife and character that bolster these cities\u0027 reputations as unique and desirable places to live.Alan, the pool manager, took pity on me. “Instead of bashing into the water with your arms like that,” he said, “stretch out like this and twist your entire torso. Instead of exhaling like that, hum and you won’t lose your breath so quickly.” It was homework, and I’d always liked homework. Slowly, I got faster.By the time I moved to Sydney, I owned proper Speedos, goggles and a kickboard. I signed myself up for a 1km charity ocean swim. From some angles it seemed as though I had pecs. Who was this person?I’ve been helped by the fact Sydney has – hands down – the best lap pools in the world. Every inner-city public pool is a wonder in some way. My local, the Prince Alfred Park Pool, is an award-winning architectural miracle built into a hill – like a swimming oasis for hobbits. It’s impossible to take a bad photo of North Sydney Olympic Pool, where the reward for finishing laps is endless Instagram-ready photos of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, which towers above the pool like a CGI hallucination. On the other side of the harbour, Andrew “Boy” Charlton Pool is plonked right in the middle of the botanical gardens, decked out like a resort and boasting so many toned men in Speedos, it feels like you’re in the video for Kylie Minogue’s Slow.Even Sydney’s indoor pools – which I usually avoid because of the claustrophobic chlorine pong – are impressive. Ultimo’s dreamy, wave-walled Ian Thorpe Aquatic Centre (the first Sydney pool I ever swam in) is a Harry Seidler original, a modernist wave of concrete and steel rising from Darling Harbour. In the Cook + Phillip Park Aquatic and Fitness Centre are giant paintings by the Archibald winner Wendy Sharpe, making it one of the few places where you can do laps in an art gallery.For a spiritual experience, it’s all about the ocean baths. On good days, you can swim alongside schools of fish in Wylie’s Baths in Coogee. There’s a reason people rave about Bondi Icebergs, with its sauna overlooking the violent churn of the surf below. And though I’ll never get to visit, I love the idea of Coogee’s McIver’s Ladies Baths, the last remaining women’s-only seawater pool in Australia. Apparently it’s particularly popular with nuns, Muslim women and lesbians I like thinking about the unexpected friendships that have been made there.Is it too far to say swimming is the Australian version of baptism? To me, these places feel sacred to swim in them veers towards sacrament. When I get writer’s block, I swim. When I need space, I swim. When I need company, I swim. When I’m depressed, I swim. When I’m happy, I swim.Last Christmas, my siblings and I – all comically terrible swimmers as kids – laughed at the fact that our eldest sister was now a regular surfer. The remaining four of us now swim regularly in lap pools. Those Asian kids at school, so bad at swimming carnivals that they were constantly disqualified? Well, some of them grew up and now swim  kilometres for leisure. It shouldn’t be surprising – we’re also Australian, after all.In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

The\u0026nbspburglar’s friends and relatives have made a little shrine from flowers and balloons above the pavement where he collapsed and died. Residents have repeatedly removed and trampled it. The police have appealed for calm and respect on both sides, and been roundly abused for it. That’s because this is a essentially religious skirmish, one in which symbolism brings up profound questions about the worth of an apparently worthless life. Flower power was not meant to work like this.Henry Vincent was a career criminal who preyed on old people, sometimes using force. On 4 April he was stabbed in the kitchen of 78-year-old Richard Osborn-Brooks, who found him there going equipped with a screwdriver. An accomplice fled and is still wanted by the police. Osborn-Brooks will not be charged and public sentiment, as well as the law, is overwhelmingly on his side. Since Vincent’s death many accounts have surfaced of his earlier crimes. Yet he left a family and friends. There are those who mourn him, and they come from a Traveller community where ostentatious public displays of grief and respect are essential funeral rites.Nothing more clearly demonstrates your position\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspsociety than your treatment after death. Today this is a matter of respect, like granting Stephen\u0026nbspHawking a grave in Westminster Abbey. But historically it has often been the opposite. Denying recognition to a corpse was a way of demonstrating exclusion. People who took their own lives were denied Christian burial the corpse of Oliver Cromwell was dug up when the monarchy was restored so that it could be mutilated and publicly displayed in the Iliad, Achilles drags the naked corpse of Hector behind his chariot around the walls of Troy until old king Priam comes to beg for the corpse of his son to give it a decent burial.It would be an exaggeration to say that the supporters of Osborn-Brooks want these things done to the corpse of Henry Vincent, but they want him away, they want him forgotten, and they want his memory out of their neighbourhood. Funerals and graves are ways of manipulating the sacred, but they also make territorial claims. “There is some corner of a foreign field,” wrote Rupert Brooke, foreseeing his own unglamorous death from dysentery, “that is forever England.”To place a memorial to Vincent on the spot where he died suggests that he had a right to be there, as well as a\u0026nbspright to live, and this is something that seems\u0026nbspviscerally\u0026nbspwrong to anyone who felt threatened by\u0026nbspthe activities of his gang.For both sides, then, this unassuming wooden fence has become a shrine. It is a symbol whose meaning can neither be avoided nor agreed. To one side it is a tribute to the other, a deliberate provocation. This row is playing on the roots of religion.The anthropologist Scott Atran talks about sacred values as being those symbols which seem so important that people are prepared to die or kill for them. This is related to the claim of one of the founders of modern sociology, Émile Durkheim, that soldiers in wartime fight, quite literally, for their flag. The thing about sacred objects, Atran says, is that they cannot be exchanged for worldly advantages. Conflicts over shrines, or sacred objects, can only be settled when both sides acknowledge the symbolic claims of the other.In that light, it is obvious how this conflict might have been resolved: by the relatives of Henry Vincent acknowledging the pain and distress he had caused, and apologising for it before they mourned his good qualities. What actually happened was almost the opposite. Possibly angered by widely reported comments from earlier victims that the dead man had\u0026nbspbeen no loss to the world, supporters of Vincent mocked Osborn-Brooks and rejoiced on social media at\u0026nbspthe way that he has been driven from his home by the\u0026nbsppressure and media attention. It’s tempting to ask who needs religion when you’ve got social media to do\u0026nbspthe work of stirring hatred.But in fact this is a moment when only some kind of\u0026nbspsymbolic, religious ceremony could possibly settle the dispute. Legally, a public street is public. The family and friends of Henry Vincent have a perfect right to be there, just as he did. But emotionally it’s a neighbourhood. The police cannot resolve the dispute by keeping one side or the other away. They cannot enforce one vision over another, nor should they. But neither is there any longer any recognised religious authority which could reconcile these two visions.Perhaps the funeral of Henry Vincent will\u0026nbspoffer a remembrance of his life reflecting his family’s conviction that he did not deserve to die. Perhaps that is\u0026nbspthe underlying message of every funeral:\u0026nbspthat the dead do not deserve to die, however bad their lives. But\u0026nbspno one should be forced to remember them who doesn’t want to.• Andrew Brown writes on religion"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9ec96ba6d2f37a20014902059cd40681ea3a0b0/0_76_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=860\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2c0a92cc90ca9ee9a12542e7c954fa9b 1720w","title":"trinidad homphobic laws win case commonwealth","story":"I am a gay Trinidadian. Until three days ago, making that statement could have landed me in prison. Before Thursday, it was a crime for adults of the same gender to have sex. Our “buggery” law imposed 25 years’ imprisonment. All other intimacy between two women or two men risked five years’ imprisonment under the demeaningly named offence of “serious indecency”.Last year I said enough is enough and sued my country to change the law. My legal team, led by Richard Drabble QC, argued that these laws violate the right to privacy, family life, equality before the law and freedom of expression.On Thursday we won the case – and resoundingly so. Mr Justice Rampersad in the high court of Port of Spain, our capital, handed down judgment agreeing that each of these rights was violated. On a rough count, there are about 100,000 LGBTQ+ people in Trinidad and Tobago. Finally, each of us is free from the fear of arrest, prosecution and imprisonment simply for living our lives.Listening to the judgment, I broke down in tears as I realised that I had won, that my country – for the first time – had accepted me for who I am. I can’t describe how it feels to hear a judge say that as a gay man I have an inherent human dignity with which the state must not interfere. His firmness on this point was commendable – laws that criminalise homosexuality, he ruled, are as heinous as those that allowed apartheid, segregation and the Holocaust. I agree.The judge recognised that when human dignity is stripped away, so as to render one characteristic “superior” to another, society goes awry. After the judgment, as I stood outside the Hall of Justice wrapped in a rainbow flag, I had finally been clothed in dignity.This judgment was the culmination of my 30 years of human rights’ activism. I was born in the 1960s, the decade that Trinidad and Tobago gained independence from Britain. Like other former colonies, we inherited Britain’s anti-gay laws. But our Spanish, French and Dutch-speaking neighbours do not criminalise homosexuality, and never did.As a teenager, it was obvious to others that I was gay. The bullying was incessant and cruel. In the 1980s I left Trinidad for London, unable to cope with the daily homophobia. In 1992 I returned home but the persecution had not changed. In 1996 I was forced away again. I came back between 2011 and 2014 to try to progress this issue through engagement and advocacy but the homophobia remained intolerable. In the end, this saga of suffering won me my case. My having to leave – effectively forced into exile – was submitted as evidence to the court of how vile these laws are.Litigation was a last resort for me, so that I could return home. That is all I have ever wanted to do. It has been the most humbling of experiences, with challenges that I could not have imagined. The religious groups who supported the retention of the laws were polite opponents, as much as we disagreed. The shock to me was that those who should most support decriminalisation most disrupted my challenge. My only support from any NGO – in Trinidad, the UK or internationally – was some funding from an HIV-prevention charity.In December 2015 I approached the Human Dignity Trust, a London-based charity whose sole purpose is to bring about the decriminalisation of homosexuality. It said it would help. I was overjoyed, but then it dropped me without explanation, blocking my remaining routes to funding in the process. Just as upsetting was how my country’s Equal Opportunity Commission (EOC) reacted to my challenge. It submitted a document to court supporting the retention of the criminal laws. At that stage, I almost gave up.I ran my case on a shoestring of around £20,000 over two-and-a-half years. That’s a mere 20p per LGBTQ+ person no longer a criminal. I now hope that my lean model becomes the norm, whereby activists are in control, unbeholden to global organisations that often only profit from our suffering.It was only the support of my legal team that kept me going – Rishi Dass and Antonio Emmanuel in Trinidad, and Peter Laverack in London, who in particular has been my rock, and was the architect of the legal arguments that won the day.At the EOC, it turned out that a junior member of staff submitted the document without authority. The day before the trial, thankfully, it was withdrawn.After the many bumps in the road, it was the rule of law that prevailed. For that, all Trinbagonians can rejoice. My dignity is their dignity is our dignity. The words of my country’s national anthem say that its citizens of every kind “find an equal place”. Now, finally, I have.With the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting taking place in London from Monday, I am hopeful that our victory offers pause to the 36 of 53 Commonwealth countries that still criminalise homosexuality. Nine are in the Caribbean.The right to dignity that Trinidad and Tobago’s court recognised in me is universal – in lesbians criminalised in Uganda and Tanzania, and in gay men criminalised in India and Singapore.It is imperative that LGBTQ+ is on the agenda in London. The event offers both a safe space for this discussion and an opportunity for the capital of the former empire that bequeathed us these heinous laws to help rid us of them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51bb3c7bbeeb9686e8c187845226de381ae5058c/447_442_6024_3614/master/6024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=74d40fd8cea88f19e524a6c7687ec155 1240w","title":"british museum director hartwig fischer there are no foreigners here the museum is a world country","story":"The German art historian reveals plans for an extensive revamp at Britain’s most visited attraction, but won’t be drawn on calls to return plundered worksHartwig Fischer, who took over the directorship of the British Museum from Neil MacGregor two years ago, has no decoration on the plain blue walls of his office. There are glass-fronted bookshelves. There ia a desk and chairs and two enormous sash windows looking out on to the great forecourt. (Or, more immediately, on to what some staff call the “Bake Off tent” – the ugly temporary structure through which visitors must currently pass for security checks.) But there is nothing to signal Fischer’s taste – nothing like the glimmering wall sculpture by El Anatsui that MacGregor had nothing like the array of Staffordshire pottery that Tristram Hunt displays in his office at the V\u0026ampA no equivalent to the Paula Rego that Maria Balshaw favours in her lair at Tate. There is only a reproduction of a Cycladic figure on the fireplace, a leftover from the MacGregor years, and, on his desk lamp, a tiny figurine of Sai Baba, a spiritual master revered as a saint, which Indian friends gave him.Instead, he says, he prefers to concentrate on the people who come through his doors – and the great treasure house of the museum. But the blankness of his working space radiates through his personal manner: he is warm and friendly, but oddly remote. His employees contrast the charismatic immediacy of MacGregor, who had the disconcerting habit of plonking himself down by random staffers in the canteen and interrogating them about their work, with this more distant figure, who speaks softly and carefully, who glides modestly around the galleries, who is sphinx-like in his statements. But for all that, he is quietly formidable, and has vast ambitions for the museum – plans that will, if they see the light of day, transform the museum for generations to come.Fischer, 56, who came to London after running the state museums in Dresden, is aiming to put the museum, in all its shopworn grandeur, through a major renovation project that will culminate in a complete redisplay of its galleries. That doesn’t sound so remarkable until you begin to absorb the scale of the job. When I joke that it can’t be as big as the Palace of Westminster’s renovation, which will cost at least £3.5bn, he tells me that the museum has more rooms than parliament – 3,000 versus 1,100 – and that the state of the essential services, such as electricity, gas and water are in dire need of repair, just as they are at Westminster. He has in mind something as grand and decisive as the “projet grand” Louvre, which saw the building of IM Pei’s dramatic pyramids and cost between F6bn and F7bn (around £780m at 1993 prices). Or the recent renovation of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, which saw the institution closed for a decade and a bill of €375m.Unlike Amsterdam, though, Fischer says: “We cannot close the museum. It’s entirely out of the question.” The British Museum is the most visited attraction in Britain, with 5.9m visitors last year. Work will have to be phased. It will take years. As for even a vague price tag, he is not to be drawn: assessments are still being carried out. And who will pay? Clearly, there will have to be the mother of all fundraising campaigns. But Fischer carefully notes that the Louvre and the Rijksmuseum were renewed “with the support of their governments”. What Fischer hopes to achieve by the end of all this is a display that is more coherent – and more interconnected. That means reshuffling the Egyptian, Greek and Roman collections so that they are not scattered between two floors as they are at present, and also finding ways to show that, as Fischer puts it, “human history was driven and has always been driven by exchange, by cultures communicating”. The interconnectedness he is keen to demonstrate might also be across time: towards the end of our interview we go over to the museum’s big exhibition space, where a stunning show on Rodin and ancient Greek sculpture is being installed. It’s the first exhibition to have been largely developed under his leadership, and its approach – looking at how an artist was shaped by his understanding of the past – might prove a hint at the shape of the programme to come.It’s an intriguing time to be considering the renewal of the British Museum – one of the world’s few so-called “encyclopedic museums” – as Fischer puts it, “a museum of the world for the world”. But Britain is on the brink of Brexit, turning its face away from Europe. When I ask Fischer if he would have taken the job had it been offered on 24 June 2016, he says: “Yes, without any hesitation whatsoever.” This contrasts to the view taken by the late Martin Roth, his predecessor at Dresden, whose resignation from the V\u0026ampA in September 2016 was said to have been hastened by disillusion at the referendum.The museum’s job, Fischer says, is to take the long view, to confront the whole of human history, to understand that Brexit is a moment in the turbulent story of the world. But at the same time: “Everyone who knows me knows I come from a European background and that Europe, as it developed after the catastrophe of the wars is something very important and precious to me. The museum has a lot to offer to help people to contemplate and reflect on what the right decisions should be without taking a direct political stance. It’s there as a space to think, reflect, debate.” It is true that Fischer could hardly be more European. He was raised in Hamburg, studied in Italy and France, and has worked in Switzerland as well as Germany his wife is a psychotherapist in Paris. It’s easy to imagine what his personal views might be, even if for now, they are cloaked in civil service neutrality. He simply says: “Whoever comes in here and crosses the threshold is not a foreigner. There are no foreigners here. This is a world country, this museum. While at the same time we recognise that this is a British creation, to which the cultures of all the world have contributed.”Contributed, yes – but not always willingly. The museum’s collection is inextricably entwined with Britain’s dark imperial past. Increasingly, nations want their objects back: not just the Greeks and the Parthenon sculptures, but others – there is a longstanding claim from Ethiopia, for example, about works of art plundered from Maqdala after its capture by the British in 1868.It’s all very well, I suggest, talking of the museum as an international project, and even as a space where international co-operation between colleagues can continue when formal diplomatic ties are strained. (Fischer made a visit to Iran in December when we meet, he has just returned from Egypt.) But the buck stops for many with the objects themselves, with the fact of possession and ownership. “When you go to see the Parthenon sculptures,” he says, “you can read about the different views, the conflicting views, and we respect different views.” Respecting views is one thing, but keeping the objects is another – that’s the line drawn right there, isn’t it? “It is a line. But what’s been created here is a major contribution to humanity. So while I respect these views, I always say what has been created here, which is open to everybody, creates an extraordinary opportunity to see cultural heritage in a context you have in only a very few places. That is the museum’s major value and it is very precious.”Fischer has come into this environment from the relatively easier circumstances of Germany, where government support for culture, though under recent pressure, is understood as a given, not fought over tooth and nail every step of the way. One of the things he is really passionate about is a music festival he has organised it will see everything from Ligeti and Nono to Japanese temple music performed in the museum’s galleries. “I’ve always worked with musicians in museums,” he says. “When you look at things listening, you look at things differently. The ears make you see more, and the eyes make you hear more.” Ironically, the festival, which is organised in partnership with the Dresden museums, is being paid for by the German foreign ministry. Still, what impresses him in London, he says, is his staff’s passionate sense of public mission. “You would never think about doing something in this place before asking who it is for. You would never get lost in an intricate scholarly debate without coming back to that question: ‘How is our public going to profit from this?’ And I cherish every day working in this environment.”The music festival Europe and the World: a Symphony of Cultures, runs from 16 to 29 April. Rodin and the art of Ancient Greece runs from 26 April to 29 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21652220c12e4a62c5360786df0c1f2077c63afc/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a09b7e20b1f8199ca8594d62834d6468 1240w","title":"uk university strike action to end after staff vote to accept offer","story":"Ballot finds significant majority in favour of accepting offer to reopen talks over pensionsThe strike action that hit 65 universities across the UK this year is to end after staff voted to accept an offer to reopen negotiations with employers over their pensions.The ballot of 50,000 University and College Union members in higher education found a substantial majority in favour of accepting the offer, which establishes a joint committee of experts to evaluate pensions provided through the University Superannuation Scheme (USS).There was a high turnout of nearly two-thirds of eligible members, with more than 21,000 voting to accept the offer from Universities UK, and 12,000 voting to reject it. A further wave of strikes due to begin next week has been suspended.Fourteen days of teaching were lost to strikes on 65 campuses last term, with fears that further action in summer would disrupt final examinations and mean that students on some courses might be unable to graduate.The strike centred on a radical overhaul of the USS – the country’s largest private sector pension scheme with 400,000 members at 67 universities and colleges, as well as 300 specialist institutions such as the Royal Society and Cancer Research UK. Staff anger was triggered by a decision in January in favour of the employers that would have ended the scheme’s defined benefits – guaranteed levels of payment to members upon retirement.Instead, the fixed benefits would be replaced by defined contributions, in which members would pay in but their eventual pension payments would be dictated by their level of payment and the state of financial markets at retirement.Sally Hunt, the UCU general secretary, said: “The union has come a very long way since January when it seemed that the employers’ proposals for a defined contribution pension were to be imposed.“Now we have agreement to move forward jointly, looking again at the USS valuation alongside a commitment from the employers to a guaranteed, defined benefit scheme.“We hope this important agreement will hearten workers across the UK fighting to defend their pension rights and was won through the amazing strike action of UCU members.”Universities UK said the decision to appoint an expert panel and suspend industrial action would reassure students that their exams would not be affected. “It is important that interested parties engage with the panel and remain open-minded about its possible findings,” a UUK spokesperson said.“Working in partnership with UCU, we will now appoint a jointly agreed chair for the panel as soon as possible before developing its terms of reference, order of work and timescales.”The Office for Students – the universities regulator in England – has told universities to make clear to students what the impact of the industrial action will be and how any related disruption will be handled."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62717b2815291a10aba55a9adcfe07b198499de6/0_0_4000_2250/master/4000.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9a2b6cf9acec80112b6b43b6ad22a69","title":"champions league draw liverpool real madrid roma bayern munich semi finals","story":"Comparisons with Liverpool’s illustrious past have often irked Jürgen Klopp as he endeavours to illuminate the future and demands that his players write their own history.He will make an exception for a showpiece European occasion with Roma at the Stadio Olimpico.

Those teams were great but they became great in these situations and now people say, ‘They did it like this.’1977:\u0026nbspLiverpool’s first European Cup final had Bob Paisley’s side take on Borussia Mönchengladbach in the Eternal City, with goals from Terry McDermott, Tommy Smith and Phil Neal’s penalty sealing a 3-1 victory. \u0027This is the second time I’ve beaten the Germans here,\u0027 said Paisley, who had been part of the Allied invasion of Italy in the second world war.\u0026nbsp1984:\u0026nbspVictories over Benfica and Dinamo Bucharest set up Liverpool’s fourth final in eight years. Their opponents were conquerors of Dundee United in the semi-finals and playing at their home stadium, but after Roberto Pruzzo cancelled out Neal’s opener, Bruce Grobbelaar’s wobbly legs helped secure a 4-2 victory in the penalty shootout.“I had a very famous German national player who was the coach of a second ision team when I was in the second ision. He did a shooting session and the boys were kind of my level so not too good. This guy took the ball and scored five times and said: ‘Look it is not that difficult.’ The boys were standing around and thinking now we know you can do it but we still have no clue. It is good to have role models but in the end you have to do it your own way.”Liverpool are gathering momentum as the season enters its defining period. Klopp, who insists victory over Bournemouth on Saturday should be the club’s sole focus when seeking a top-four finish, claims belief is also soaring among players, fans and Anfield legends, having reached the last four of the Champions League.He added: “It’s nice being in the semi-finals. Like I said before Manchester City, write our own history. You only judge history when you watch it back and I am really happy we are in a situation where we are focused on this group. The legends we all love are around and they are clapping because they like this. Kenny Dalglish is over the moon and completely on fire. Steven Gerrard and all the other guys in between, you can feel it and see it. That’s cool.“It’s normal when you go to a semi-final, especially after a long time and you hear the numbers – Bayern six times in a row, semi-final Madrid eight. Then Roma and us. That’s nice but in the end it’s a nice sign that we are so far so good.“The City game showed it but we have space to improve. Yes, in a few moments we can be at a really high level and we have a few things that make us an uncomfortable opponent and the other team has to think: ‘We better not do that’.“When they work they get more confident and now it’s a case of attitude, character, staying greedy and wanting to do the next step. That’s why it is important we are now fully focused on Bournemouth. Everything is positive, talk so much about positive things and as human beings when you constantly hear you are fantastic it is the first step to not being fantastic any more. We have to stay this kind of angry.“We have so much to go for and it will never stop because even if the season finishes there will be space for improvement and working from that is the plan. The relationship between us and the supporters, in terms of the sense of belief from both sides, has reached the next level and that’s all credit to the boys.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b45b517e79a7650467ab1c5a6e82d3425d586ecf/0_538_3698_2219/master/3698.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1b467493493806046059aa8d01c4ab14 1240w","title":"manchester city tottenham pep guardiola sergio aguero","story":"• City manager says team affected by three consecutive defeats• Argentina striker will miss trip to Tottenham with knee injuryPep Guardiola has said Manchester City could blow their 13-point lead over Manchester United and fail to be crowned champions.Guardiola’s team are clear favourites to win a third Premier League title, with City and United each having only six matches left. Yet having seen his team lose their previous three games – away and home to Liverpool in the Champions League, and in the league to United – the manager cited the example of Real Madrid in 2003‑04, when they led Valencia by a point but suffered six defeats in the final seven matches to finish fourth in La Liga, behind Rafael Benítez’s then side.City are at Tottenham Hotspur for Saturday’s late fixture. A victory, combined with a United defeat against West Brom on Sunday would secure the title but it was put to Guardiola that if City lose and United beat West Bromwich Albion and Bournemouth before his side play again they may start to feel the pressure.In this scenario United would have cut the deficit to seven points having played a match more. Guardiola said: “It can happen. Football is full of emotions but what we have to try to do is focus and win our games against Tottenham, Swansea and after that the other ones. So we know that.Regarding how pressure is more intense when trying to seal the title, Guardiola said: “That will be good for our future, you have to handle that. You have to learn that because, at the end, if we were not able to do it and United win the league, all we can say is ‘congratulations’ to United, reflect on what we have done badly in the last month and move forward. But in football it can happen.”Guardiola countered any notion that such a scenario is unlikely. “Of course it can happen, I assure you. Real Madrid, years ago, lost six games and didn’t win the league. So of course it can happen, no doubts about that.”“When the opponent is good, we will congratulate our opponents on beating us, and after learn from that for the next game.”While Guardiola admitted Sergio Agüero’s ability to play again this season is in the balance because of a knee problem, the Spaniard said the 32-year-old David Silva may appear less next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2e0504ff0d1aed4350ac68d43917ac0f3cb213e/399_143_744_744/master/744.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=464ec7869477c0b45511177fefb51395 1240w","title":"thomasina miers recipe for pickled herring beetroot and horseradish salad","story":" The sharpness of cured fish is a delight against tender and earthy beets, making a wonderful light lunchAt weekends I like to go to my local farmers’ market and head straight to the fish stand.

After a patient build-up, 2017 was such a breakthrough year for the bewitching London-born singer – selling over a million copies of her self-titled debut album and cruising past some of the world’s biggest pop stars to be crowned the most-streamed female artist in the UK – that she could probably take a few months off. But Lipa has continued her vertiginous career ascent in 2018, claiming two Brit awards in February, teaming up with dancefloor genie Calvin Harris for sleek new club banger One Kiss and insouciantly cracking a billion YouTube views for New Rules, her signature hit that warns against backsliding into a lousy relationship with a stern but moreish checklist-style mantra.While impressive on paper, racking up record-breaking streaming stats can sometimes feel like an intangible, almost passive form of success. But Lipa’s industrious workrate and gruelling tour schedule (including a stint supporting Coldplay) have clearly brought palpable real-world benefits. When she last played Glasgow six months ago it was in a crammed 2,500-capacity venue. Now she is packing them to the rafters in a giant arena bowl made for 13,000. Her core fanbase skews young and female but while the screams are as loud and piercing as at any Bieber show, the crowd seem keen to reflect back some of Lipa’s worldly sophistication. Compared to most full-bore pop gigs at the Hydro, there is a distinct lack of strobing deely boppers.On magazine covers and in impeccably styled promo shots, Lipa often looks aloof or simply nonplussed. But the 22-year-old kicks off by imploring fans to “be your most unapologetic you” and “dance the night away”, and promptly leads by example through Blow Your Mind (Mwah), a slice of futuristic disco that slyly incorporates an actual kiss-off into its chorus. For sustained stretches of her 90-minute show, Lipa is in perpetual motion, bouncing and reeling round the stage in billowing black joggers, springy trainers and aquamarine bra. She is flanked by four equally tireless dancers while her long-serving backing trio of a drummer and two multitasking keyboardguitarists jam away atop oversized stage cubes.A massive projection screen showing artfully stylised visuals and pulsing hyperspace starfields is arena-show standard but otherwise there is a distinct lack of large-scale staging gimmicks. It makes it all the more impressive that Lipa is able to sustain so many winningly jazzercise-style dance routines without missing a note.There are moments of delirious communion, as when Lipa hoists herself up on the front-row stage barrier to conduct a singalong to the yearning Be the One. But there are also moments of spine-tingling spotlight: the stripped-down obsessional ballad Thinking ’Bout You, with just her and guitar, showcases her voice at its smokiest. Strip away the headstrong beats and synthy stabs of her biggest hits and Lipa would remain a potent, intuitive torch singer.The biggest laugh of the night comes toward the end when a title card pops up dedicating IDGAF to “all the fuckboys who have done you wrong”. While this playground-chant anthem to empowerment doesn’t yet match the climactic New Rules in terms of streams and views, it is – perhaps tellingly – the song fans are raucously singing a capella as they spill out of the venue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cd46d18282e53e786314bf62f159e644e1204ee/0_167_2439_1463/master/2439.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=82cac3cca467042bde4ed1cc74637e93 1240w","title":"pm among cabinet members earning money as a landlord","story":"Exclusive: senior politicians such as Theresa May and Boris Johnson make thousands of pounds a year renting propertyNine cabinet ministers, including the prime minister, are making more than £10,000 a year by acting as landlords, a Guardian analysis has found.Following Jeremy Hunt’s failure to declare the purchase of seven luxury flats that he subsequently rented out, an analysis of the parliamentary register of MPs’ interests shows eight other members of the cabinet own property that is rented out for a five-figure annual sum.The health secretary was forced to make an embarrassing apology on Friday after it emerged that he had failed to declare a business interest with both Companies House and the parliamentary register of MPs’ interests.Hunt has amended the register, which now shows that he has a half share of a holiday home in Italy, a half share in an office building in Hammersmith and seven recently acquired apartments in Southampton.Theresa May and Philip Hammond, who both live in Downing Street, rent out their personal homes in central London. Communities and housing secretary Sajid Javid also rents out property, while Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, rents out two properties, according to the registerThe foreign secretary Boris Johnson, the international trade secretary Liam Fox, the minister without portfolio Brandon Lewis – who is also the Conservative party chairman – and the Welsh minister Alun Cairns also own and rent out a property, according to the register.There is no suggestion that the ministers are in breach of the ministerial code.Hunt’s declared property interests are comfortably larger than any of the other ministers listed. He set up Mare Pond Properties Ltd with his wife, Lucia Guo which have since bought seven flats in Alexandra Wharf, a redevelopment project on the Southampton waterfront worth £40m.When the registration documents were filed in September 2017 only his wife was named, constituting a breach of regulations.Kathryn Hudson, parliament’s commissioner for standards, received a complaint about Hunt on Friday and will consider it early next week, a spokesperson said. Labour said Hunt’s actions represented a “serious breach”. Shadow cabinet office minister Jon Trickett said: “This is simply unacceptable and especially so given the secretary of state’s position at the heart of Theresa May’s government.”Guardian inquiries have established that the flats were developed by a property company owned by a Conservative donor.The 82-flat luxury block was developed by Nicolas James Group, a south coast property company owned and chaired by businessman and Conservative donor Nicolas James Roach.Roach has made more than £50,000 in donations to Hunt’s South West Surrey constituency office since 2011, mostly in the form of the complimentary venue hire.Hunt and Roach were pictured together in 2011 at a party to launch a £60m hotel partly developed by Roachs’ company in Guildford, which is in Hunt’s Surrey constituency.A spokeswoman for Hunt said: “The owner of the development is a long-standing acquaintance. Jeremy paid standard market rates which would have been available to anyone else making an equivalent purchase”.According to the property giant Savills, each flat in the development is worth between £450,000 and £1m. The spokeswoman blamed Hunt’s accountant for mistakes in the Companies House’ documents. “These were honest administrative mistakes, which have already been rectified,” she said. “Jeremy’s accountant made an error in the Companies House filing, which was a genuine oversight.“With respect to ministerial and parliamentary declarations, the Cabinet Office are clear that there has been no breach of the ministerial code.”A Downing Street spokesman said: “Jeremy has rightly apologised for an administrative oversight, and as the Cabinet Office have made clear there has been no breach of the ministerial code. “We consider the matter closed.” Dr Alex May, the academic who spotted Hunt’s omissions and whose email on 28 March prompted a change to Hunt’s Companies House filing, told the Guardian that the health secretary’s office only admitted wrongdoing after he went public with the information on Friday. “There is a lack of scrutiny from Companies House,” he said. “It allows people to break the law, sometimes unwittingly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0e91b772027eb70014982f82a71a3a27066f94e/0_0_1233_1230/master/1233.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=be1815b3f4b5852e380c66156abf0e75 1240w","title":"chess leonard barden fabiano caruana magnus carlsen grenke","story":"The 25-year-old American has jumped to No 2 in the live ratings after winning two elite tournaments and is closing in on Carlsen, who he will play in the world title series this yearFabiano Caruana has won two elite tournaments in a fortnight, jumped to No\u0026nbsp2 in the live ratings only 21 points behind the world champion, Magnus Carlsen, and starts play in the US championship in St Louis on\u0026nbspWednesday.America’s world title challenger is already putting psychological pressure on Carlsen, seven months before their 12-game world title series. While capturing the Grenke Classic at Baden-Baden, Caruana won his final two games with the unfavourable black pieces, and, just as in the candidates at Berlin, went for the full point in the last round when a draw would have ensured first prize.The 25-year-old downsized his result, saying he had played better in Berlin but “the work and the form I was in carried over here, I kept getting chances and I took them.” He could have lost twice, once a fleeting opportunity missed by Carlsen and the other when the No\u0026nbsp1 woman, Hou Yifan, overlooked a study-like endgame win. Carlsen was also unbeaten but the Norwegian escaped against the German tailender Georg Meier who could have sacrificed both rooks for a brilliant mate which he missed in time pressure.While Caruana begins St Louis on Wednesday, Carlsen will start on Thursday at Shamkir, Azerbaijan, where his rivals include three of the candidates who Caruana outpaced in Berlin, plus Anish Giri who tied with the world champion at Wijk aan Zee.Then Caruana and Carlsen will be at the super-strong Altibox Norway event in May and June. Later still Carlsen will be at Biel, Switzerland, in July, while in September Caruana will lead the US team in the 150-nation Olympiad as they bid to repeat their gold medals of 2016.For both, this is an intense competitive programme compared with past world championships where the players would often prepare with their aides for weeks or months. It foreshadows a tight and close contest in November which is likely to go the distance. Since title matches were reduced to the best of 12 games, nearly half of them have been settled by speed tie-breaks.Right now, Carlsen and Caruana are evenly matched and in their 20s with many career years ahead, so there is the prospect of one of the great chess rivalries developing, like Alexander Alekhine v José Raúl Capablanca in the 1920s and 1930s, Mikhail Botvinnik v Vassily Smyslov in the 1950s, and Anatoly Karpov v Garry Kasparov in the 1980s.Caruana broke another taboo in the final round at Grenke when he unleashed a startling opening novelty rather than hoard it until November.

(13 c3) allowed Caruana to improve his position. After 16…d4! Black was well on top as his Bd5 and Nf5 were monsters cramping White’s activity. 28 Bxf5 eliminated the dominating knight, but then Caruana had the bishop pair. The pressure mounted even after exchange of queens until 36 Nxf5? (36 Nc2 is more resilient) conceded the exchange,after which Caruana quickly wrapped up the game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7943645a49edd32eacb50ba495c0569cfbd640ae/130_275_4845_2907/master/4845.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0de0585df12d5031561084d02008a316 1240w","title":"ellis genge leicester prop fit and firing northampton","story":"Leicester’s aggressive prop has returned from surgery fit and firing and says his reputation for losing his temper is unjustifiedEllis Genge wants to set the record straight. The Leicester and England prop does not care for statistics but one in particular has caught his eye. Genge often treads the line between confrontational and combustible – “He’s more bark than bite,” said his head coach, Matt O’Connor, recently – but the 23-year-old feels his reputation for losing his temper on the field is unjustified.“I’ve given away one penalty for ill-discipline all season and that was last weekend,” he says. “For some reason I’m carrying around this dark cloud that means I’m Mr Angry but if you’re a prop and you haven’t got a bit of a temper you’re playing the wrong position. Everyone thinks I am a raving lunatic but it is not the case at all. It is just how I play – I am not frustrated in any way, shape or form. I just enjoy doing what I do.”Genge’s difficult upbringing on the West Knowle estate in Bristol is well documented. He was a latecomer to rugby – taking up the sport as a means to channel his aggression – and by his own admission, his rapid emergence into the Leicester first team last season meant for a steep learning curve. “I was a lot angrier when I was 18 than I am now. Now it’s channelled more so into rugby than in everyday life. I’ve seen a lot of sports psychologists, done a bit of therapy, stuff like that,” he says. “Everyone has a different story to tell and you have just got to work it out yourself, it’s part of the process of growing up. Luckily, I’ve done quite a lot of that, quite quickly.”Leicester and England are thankful that he has. Genge has recently recovered from a shoulder injury – a torn labrum that meant three months out – but before and after that he has been one of the Tigers’ best performers. He carries with unbridled aggression – he was described as a “baby rhino with a dart up its backside” earlier this season – but in the two matches since his return from injury it is his scrummaging that has stood out. In his comeback match against Wasps last month, Genge’s emergence from the bench turned the game in Leicester’s favour and he marmalised Bath’s Shaun Knight at Twickenham last Saturday. “With scrums I used to get built up too much around frustration and wound up so that I forgot about set-up and technique,” he says. “I’ve dialled that down now so when I’m in the scrum I can apply myself.”Genge’s improvement at the scrum is down to a number of factors. He was a late convert to the front row, having previously played No 8, and he played through the pain of his injury, including his most recent England appearance against Samoa in November, before finally going under the knife. When fit and firing though, O’Connor believes Genge is the prototype for modern props and, while he missed the Six Nations, he seems a certainty for the summer tour of South Africa irrespective of England’s riches at loosehead.“I’m feeling very strong. I am like a bull, the rehab was quite a long and daunting process because I have never had a long-term injury,” says Genge. “But everyone plays international rugby when they’re hurt.Genge clearly enjoys being typecast as the hard man. Asked if he relishes confrontation he fixes his stare before simply replying with “I love it” so his passion of fine-dining may seem incongruous. It does, however, extend to an appearance as a guest judge in a rugby-themed episode of Masterchef. “They needed my culinary expertise,” he says. “Being a prop I’m allowed to eat a lot of food. I love the show as well, my agent knew that, the opportunity arose and I got the chance to go on there and pretend I knew what I was talking about.”He does not pretend to when it comes to the east Midlands rivalry with Northampton – who visit Welford Road on Saturday – but with Leicester closing on their perennial play-off place, Genge is relishing the end-of-season run-in. “I’m not a Leicester lad but I feel like I’ve been adopted by the fans, which is lovely,” he says. “I like the vibe I get from the boys and I feed off that but it’s not my city so I can’t preach on that too much.• Land Rover, the official vehicle partner of Premiership Rugby, is celebrating 10 seasons of supporting grassroots rugby in the UK.

A bit of a girl clutching the neck of a bandy-legged outsider streaked across the line to win the greatest race in turfdom! A girl wins the Grand National!”Thus gabbles the radio commentator in the 1944 film National Velvet, heralding the success of a character played by Elizabeth Taylor. Three parts of a century have since rolled by and horse racing reporters are still waiting for their chance to trumpet such a line for real, hopefully without the patronising diminutive. But perhaps the moment is finally at hand because Saturday’s race will feature an almost unprecedented three female jockeys.They have not been booked for outsiders, bandy-legged or otherwise their horses feature in the top half of the betting. Nor are they unknown teenagers, like Taylor’s character, but established riders of proven talent. On his way to Aintree on Thursday, the Telegraph’s man tweeted a picture of Enid Bagnold’s novel that was the source for National Velvet and asked: “Is this the most relevant form book for this year’s race?”Bagnold’s heroine, the strong-willed Velvet Brown with her uncanny empathy for a horse, is arguably a pallid creation by comparison with the effervescent Bryony Frost, who will take her first tilt at the National aboard Milansbar. Frost, a self-described “Devon dumpling” and the daughter of a National-winning rider, had a donkey for a babysitter from the age of two and used to fall asleep on his back. She was in pony races from the age of nine. If ever a person was born and raised to be a steeplechase jockey, she was.She will be joined in Saturday’s lineup by Rachael Blackmore, only the second female professional jockey in the history of Irish jump racing, and Katie Walsh, whose third place in the 2012 National is the best result achieved by a woman. Those coincidence backers annually drawn to the National may like to know that Walsh’s mount, Baie Des Iles, will carry the same saddle-cloth number (28) as did Taylor’s in the movie.The no-nonsense Walsh will surely take no interest in such a detail. Asked if this is a significant moment, she underlines the importance of opportunity. “The reality of it is that I’m riding for my husband. And Rachael has an association with Gigginstown, owners of her horse. And Bryony is riding a horse she won on last time.“Next year, that might not be the case. I wouldn’t be riding in the National, if I wasn’t riding one for Ross.”Walsh was born into a racing family, which opened doors. She is well aware other talented jockeys, male and female, are less fortunate. “It’s just so competitive. It’s a very small, condensed sport and there’s only room for a handful of people at the top.”Only once before have three women ridden in the National, 30 years ago. Penny Ffitch-Heyes and Venetia Williams were thrilled to be in the lineup but both were on no-hopers, at odds of 100-1 and 200-1 respectively, and neither got beyond the sixth fence. Gee Armytage fared better on Gee-A, leading the field on the run down to the second Becher’s before her horse tired.Female participation in the National had become the norm, soon after Charlotte Brew was the trailblazer in 1977. Over the next 12 years, 11 different women had rides in the race. Since then, only four new names have been added to the list. While Walsh and her sister-in-law Nina Carberry have had 11 rides between them, no other woman has lined up since 2005. Where did all the female jump jockeys go?Some, including Armytage, have suggested trainers and owners were put off using women by a series of shocking injuries, including the death of Jayne Thompson at Catterick and the paralysis suffered by Sharron Murgatroyd and Jessica Charles-Jones in incidents at other tracks. Such things also happened to men, but female pain, according to the theory, was harder for some people to contemplate.That is not how Williams sees it, having had a long and successful career as a trainer. “I don’t think injuries are what put people off, really. Maybe that was the party line but we weren’t very good. End of. These girls are a hell of a lot better than we were in my day.“Gee Armytage might get a bit cross with me for saying that,” she adds, laughing, “but they’re streets better.”Thanks to the cumulative effect of Walsh, Carberry, Frost and Blackmore, it seems racing insiders are increasingly prepared to accept the right woman on the right horse can successfully fight her corner in any jumps race. Paul Nicholls, a former champion trainer, has given Frost a huge push. Gigginstown Stud, the dominant owner in Irish jumps racing, regularly employs female jockeys.Frost and Blackmore will inevitably, some day, get chances to prove how resilient they can be when injured. But when one reporter told Frost this week to “come back in one piece”, she just laughed.“I’m not worried about that,” she said. “Getting in the car is the most dangerous part of the day.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6104861bbc332f057d22b77698e34e845e6cc99e/0_0_2623_1573/master/2623.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3df8c8ff0f5c5c285b5783fc6230864c 1240w","title":"leeds wigan rugby super league match report","story":"• Leeds 8-9 Wigan• Tomkins manages five points as Wigan win from 8-0 downPerhaps it was inevitable Sam Tomkins would have the last laugh. In the moments leading up to kick-off, he was ridiculed by the Leeds supporters after slipping while attempting a warm-up conversion attempt. In true Tomkins fashion, it still sailed through the posts.Tomkins has plenty of previous with Leeds, of course – seven years ago he was in the thick of the headlines when Wigan beat the Rhinos in the Challenge Cup final – but how he and Wigan will have savoured this moment more than most.Wins at Leeds do not come easily for Wigan, who had not won here since 2012. And, just as he has been so many times before, Tomkins was at the heart of this latest performance, though the question remains as to how many more he will be involved in beyond this season.Speculation continues to link the 29-year-old with a move to Catalans for 2019 the general consensus is that the deal is already done. “Whatever happens, we’ll deal with it,” responded Shaun Wane when asked about Tomkins’s future. On nights like these it is clear to see why Wigan would want to keep him.And a remarkable ending – in which Wigan overturned an eight-point deficit in the final nine minutes to win courtesy of Tomkins’s game-winning drop goal – at least managed to somewhat overshadow a game which is highly unlikely to make it to the end-of-season highlights package.For over an hour, both sides toiled amidst a host of penalties and handling errors it was far from the ideal advert for Super League in a game featuring the competition’s last two champions. And when Leeds went eight points ahead with 16 minutes remaining, the smart money was on them leapfrogging Wigan into second place. And, in their coach’s own enigmatic way, he summed up their collapse well. “We stuck our heads up our backside and didn’t pull them out,” Brian McDermott said. “We started playing crazy and we changed the way we played.”Leeds scored the only try of a largely forgettable and frustrating first half, after a fine Richie Myler pass found Tom Briscoe unmarked. It was a rare moment of quality, with the next points not coming until after the hour mark when Watkins kicked Leeds into a two-score lead.Wigan’s performance to that point was epitomised by Tomkins, whose effort and endeavour was underlined by unforced errors, but he would ultimately have the final say. He played a part in the move which allowed Oliver Gildart to score with nine minutes remaining, and after he kicked the conversion, he followed suit with a penalty before sending over the drop goal which won the game with three minutes left."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30a9e4d319e171f85366c419347fcc635ab0d2a9/0_0_3601_2401/master/3601.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b335fc59780a5890d25c71eb9f900ca2 1440w","title":"google loses right to be forgotten case","story":"Businessman wins legal action to force removal of search results about past convictionA businessman has won his legal action to remove search results about a criminal conviction in a landmark “right to be forgotten” case that could have wide-ranging repercussions.The ruling was made by Mr Justice Warby in London on Friday. The judge rejected a similar claim brought by a second businessman who was jailed for a more serious offence. The claimant who lost, referred to only as NT1 for legal reasons, was convicted of conspiracy to account falsely in the late 1990s the claimant who won, known as NT2, was convicted more than 10 years ago of conspiracy to intercept communications. NT1 was jailed for four years, while NT2 was jailed for six months.Granting an appeal in the case of NT1, the judge added: “It is quite likely that there will be more claims of this kind, and the fact that NT2 has succeeded is likely to reinforce that.”Both men demanded that Google remove search results mentioning the cases for which they were convicted. These include links to web pages published by a national newspaper and other media. Google refused their request and the men took the company to the high court.The decision in NT2’s favour could have implications for other convicted criminals and those who want embarrassing stories about them erased from the web. Warby ruled out any damages payment, however.Explaining his decision, the judge said NT1 continued to mislead the public, whereas NT2 had shown remorse. He also took into account the submission that NT2’s conviction did not concern actions taken by him in relation to “consumers, customers or investors”, but rather in relation to the invasion of privacy of third parties.He said his key conclusion in relation to NT2’s claim was that “the crime and punishment information has become out of date, irrelevant and of no sufficient legitimate interest to users of Google search to justify its continued availability”. In the case of NT1, however, the judge was scathing about the claimant’s position since leaving prison. “He has not accepted his guilt, has misled the public and this court, and shows no remorse over any of these matters,” he said.“He remains in business, and the information serves the purpose of minimising the risk that he will continue to mislead, as he has in the past. Delisting would not erase the information from the record altogether, but it would make it much harder to find.”In 2014 the European court of justice (ECJ) ruled that “irrelevant” and outdated data should be erased on request. Since then, Google has received requests to remove at least 2.4m links from search results. Search engine firms can reject applications if they believe the public interest in accessing the information outweighs a right to privacy.At a high court hearing in February, Hugh Tomlinson QC, representing NT1, told the high court that the visibility of the articles on the search engine caused “distress and upset” to his client.Tomlinson, who is also chairman of the press regulation campaign group Hacked Off, told the court the businessman was not a public figure and now made a living from commercial lending and funding a property developer.“Before anyone meets a new person these days they Google them,” Tomlinson said. He added that many people engaged in misdeeds when they were young and if the misdeeds were constantly brought to the attention of others then they would permanently have a negative effect.NT1’s conviction was now spent, Tomlinson continued, and the law was designed to allow for the rehabilitation of offenders so they could go on to lead normal lives.But Antony White QC, representing Google, argued the ECJ’s “right to be forgotten” ruling was “not a right to rewrite history or ... tailor your past if that’s what this claimant would like to use it for”.White said the business malpractice that gave rise to NT1’s conviction was “serious and sustained”.NT2, in a separate hearing, also argued that his conviction was legally spent and he therefore had a right to be forgotten. Google resisted taking down search results linking to articles including reports on his financial affairs, his conviction and interviews given by him several years later containing his account of the circumstances surrounding his conviction.A Google spokesperson said: “We work hard to comply with the right to be forgotten, but we take great care not to remove search results that are in the public interest and will defend the public’s right to access lawful information. We are pleased that the court recognised our efforts in this area, and we will respect the judgments they have made in this case.”"},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

Though it’s a few hundred miles from the ocean, you’ll still find beaches, some of which are home to a vibrant daytime party scene. Nearby there are stunning natural wonders — mountains, lakes and hiking trails – perfect for all kinds of recreational activities. With so many options for fun in the sun, we take a look at some of the best.A full beach experience right on the Strip. Body surf in the wave pool, relax on a day bed, or take a gentle float down the lazy river. There are cabanas for all temperaments, whether you want seclusion or want to party. To really get away from the crowds, hire a cabana or gazebo with private pool and lounge area. The beach is family friendly, but head to the nearby Toptional Moorea club for a more grown-up experience.Mandalay Bay, 3950 S. Las Vegas Blvd.No need to stop the party just because the sun is shining – Wet Republic supplies the beats, dipping pools and festive atmosphere for all-day clubbing. A-list DJs, including Calvin Harris, Tiësto and Kaskade, keep the party going while there are a range of VIP options — take a bungalow for privacy and a personal jacuzzi, or be right in the action and book a banquette by the dance floor.MGM Grand, 3799 S. Las Vegas Blvd.Pick a pool. Caesars Palace has seven to choose from, each with its own theme. They all feature cabanas and day beds, so be guided by your mood. The Apollo pool receives the most sunlight, while the Jupiter is more secluded. Gamers will like the Fortuna, which has a swim-up blackjack table, while those looking for a European vibe should head for the Venus pool lounge. For the ultimate in relaxation book a massage session with Qua Baths \u0026amp Spa, which offers poolside services.Caesars Palace, 3570 S. Las Vegas Blvd.The Wynn’s day life unfolds at the Encore, a beach club that centres around its three-tiered pools. The DJ talent is world class, with the likes of the Chainsmokers, David Guetta and Diplo on the roster. Comfy cabanas come with a lush day bed, TV (who’s watching TV with a party raging outside?) and stocked fridge. Bungalow residents get extra luxuries such as a cooling system, infinity pool and, crucially, a private bathroom.Wynn Las Vegas, 3131 S. Las Vegas Blvd.Just a half-hour’s drive from the Strip is Lake Mead, a recreation area known as the most erse in America. Visitors come for year-round activities, including jet skiing, paddleboarding, sport fishing and kayaking. There are a number of picnic spots throughout the park, and for a night away from the city’s hubbub, pitch a tent in one of the 10 campgrounds, or stay at one of the lakeside resorts.The Tank, as the Golden Nugget’s pool is called, can boast what no other can: here you can swim with sharks. Well, almost. An enclosed waterslide plunges nine metres, travelling through an aquarium filled with some 300 sea creatures, including said sharks and sting rays. The H2O bar supplies the drinks, while lounging in the sun is as strenuous as things need to get if you prefer. On the third floor is the Hideout, an infinity pool for over-21s with day beds, chaise lounges and luxury cabanas.Golden Nugget, 129 E. Fremont StreetA visit to the Hoover Dam is on many a bucket list, but to really experience the magnificence of the structure hop in a kayak. As you paddle out into the Colorado River, you’ll have an epic view as the 220-metre (726-foot) dam looms above. A number of companies offer day or half-day tours that take in highlights of the Black Canyon, including sauna caves and geothermal hot springs. Desert bighorn sheep, falcons and bald eagles are some of the wildlife that you might spot. The water is flat and suitable for beginners.The Dayclub is responsible for party duties at The Cosmopolitan in the day time. Spanning the multilevel Marquee Nightclub, there are also two pools, which is where you want to be to take in the first-class DJ action, including the likes of Dash Berlin, DJ Mustard and Tritonal. Upgrade to a grand cabana for dedicated service and infinity dipping pools, or go large with a bungalow that has its own pool, party deck and sleeping quarters.The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, 3708 S. Las Vegas Blvd.Less than an hour’s drive from Las Vegas is Mount Charleston, a 3,700-metre (12,000-foot) peak that is part of the Spring Mountains, which rise spectacularly out of the Mojave desert. There are more than 50 miles of trails to explore, four campgrounds and a range of activities from horseback riding to biking. The Lee Canyon resort offers winter skiing, snowshoeing and tubing, as well as disc golf during the warmer months. Other places to stay nearby include the well-appointed Mt Charleston Las Vegas resort.It might sit atop the Downtown Grand Hotel but the vibe at this pool deck is one of backyard party. Family-friendly games include corn hole, foosball and table tennis, while there is plenty of space for lounging (cabanas are also available for hire), a full bar and a restaurant helmed by chef Scott Cummings, a former-Hell’s Kitchen winner. DJs and live entertainment also feature at weekends. As a bonus, there are superb views of downtown Las Vegas.Downtown Grand, 206 N. 3rd StreetFifteen miles west of Las Vegas sits the Red Rock Canyon Conservation Area, nearly 81,000 hectares (200,000 acres) of rugged beauty. It’s known for its hiking trails (there are 26 numbered hikes), which cater for all levels of fitness and reach from canyon floors to the highest points. A 13-mile paved road provides a scenic drive through stunning desert landscapes other activities include mountain biking, horseback riding and target shooting — it’s also a wonderful spot for stargazing.This luxurious but relaxed resort, away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip, has two pools. The M Pool is the family-friendly version it has plenty of seating and cabanas for hire, and there are two large hot tubs on the pool deck. The over-21s pool club, DayDream, open at weekends and on holidays, is much more adult focused, with bar and bottle service available as well as top-name DJs providing the tunes.M Resort Spa Casino, 12300 S.

But at the same time, we must respect neighbours’ opinions.”Klimt said the work would stay up for a short while so everyone interested could experience it. Although some people had welcomed the penis as an “important part of the debate about sexuality, body and gender”, others – especially neighbours – had “received it less well and perceived it as offensive”, she said. Atrium Ljungberg has allowed a collective of local artists, Kollektivet Livet, free rein to decorate the apartment block wall as it sees fit since 2008. The murals usually stay in place for at least six months before a new one is commissioned.Falkholt said at the unveiling that she hoped her blue penis would be better received in Stockholm than a similar pink one was when it appeared on the side of an apartment building in Manhattan’s Lower East Side in December. The New York work was painted over within three days instead of the intended three weeks after similar complaints from locals. But Falkholt said on Wednesday she thought the reaction in her native Sweden would be different. “I think perhaps it will be allowed to remain here, people will get the message and let it take its place in the debate,” she said. “I think there’s more intellectual space to discuss the subject, in a nuanced way.” She said she liked to think of the Stockholm painting – titled Fuck the World – as “a reincarnation”. Falkholt could not be reached for comment on Friday.

I didn’t realise how much I had lost over the period of time. I can focus better. I can read faster.

I was overwhelmed because I wasn’t getting tired and I wasn’t getting breathless, which would have been a normal occurrence for the past two years, even with oxygen.”Ms Tinsley urged people to have conversations about organ donation with their families and to consider signing up as donors.“I was getting emotional because I was thinking of my donor and their sacrifice, generosity, and forward thinking,” she said. “Their ability to have the conversation with their family beforehand, and when tragically they died, they gave me life.“It is the greatest legacy anyone could ever give to someone else. I just hope that people will consider being organ donors. I’m very thankful for all the incredible support I’ve had from Ireland and people here in the US too.“It was really amazing that people saw my story and decided they wanted to become organ donors.“When I woke up from my transplant in the intensive care unit and was recovering, I got a lot of tweets from people in Ireland with photos of the organ donor card they were signing.

Photograph: Limerickleader.ieA Church of Ireland bishop has said that he intends to vote to repeal the Eighth Amendment in the constitution. Bishop Kenneth Kearon, the Bishop of Limerick and Killaloe, said supporting repeal is “entirely consistent” with the Church of Ireland’s views on abortion as it opposed the original referendum in 1983.In February, the Church of Ireland archbishops of Armagh and Dublin, Dr Richard Clarke and Dr Michael Jackson, issued a joint statement on the Eighth Amendment. They stopped short of calling for repeal directly, but said they favoured a modification of article 40.3.3 in “such a way that allows for the Oireachtas to have legislative responsibility to address termination of pregnancy, any rights of the unborn and the rights of the pregnant woman within clearly defined boundaries and parameters”. In a letter to his diocese, Bishop Kearon said the Church of Ireland seldom takes an official line on any issue especially on ethical issues where personal responsibility and conscience are paramount. “Instead the church offers guidance and help to those making decisions while respecting the rights of all to differ from that advice and to decide freely according to their own conscience,” he explained. Bishop Kearon said the Church of Ireland was opposed to abortion on principle, but accepted that exceptions have to be made in the case of where a mother’s life is at risk, where the baby will not survive or where rape and incest have been involved. He said modern biology supports the contention of some of the early fathers of the Christian churches, St Augustine and St Thomas Aquinas, that life does not begin at conception. “We find speculation about the beginning of life, often equating it with ensoulment (when the soul enters the body) or with the time when the mother first ‘feels life’ or movement, all of which are stages long after conception has taken place,” the bishop said. “Modern biology which recognises that very many conceptions do not continue on through the various stages of development to become births but are ‘lost’, does appear to support this line of thinking also.”However, the bishop said he had “greater concerns” about the draft legislation which would allow for termination on any grounds up to 12 weeks. He said the argument for the 12-week limit was based on the availability of abortion pills on the internet and so by making it legal, it opens the possibility of medical supervision and assistance. “That is hardly an ethical argument,” he suggested. He proposed that legislators take a “pragmatic approach to termination of pregnancy” He suggested looking for legislation which permits termination when the life rather than the health of the mother is at risk. Abortion could be permitted in cases where the baby will not survive, the bishop suggested, but not on grounds of disability. “Hopefully any such cases would be rare, but provision does need to be made for them,” the bishop concluded. “Legislators are in a difficult position at this time, and most are courageously seeking to approach this issue in a responsible manner. They deserve our prayers and our support at this time. So far the debate has been serious and respectful, and let’s all try to keep it that way.”Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum hereThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3460020.1523612445!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ulster rugby and irfu officials under pressure from sponsors","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPaddy Jackson was cleared of the charges on March 28th. Photograph: PacemakerUlster Rugby and IRFU officials are coming under increasing pressure from sponsors to effectively deal with “issues” raised during the trial of Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding. Official Ulster Rugby shirt sponsor Bank of Ireland (BoI) has said it is “highly concerned” about the “serious behaviour and conduct issues” that emerged in the trial involving the two players, who, at Belfast Crown Court last month, were cleared of raping the same woman in 2016.The bank, a key sponsor of the club for 20 years, has been in touch with Ulster Rugby chief executive Shane Logan regarding the case.“It is of paramount importance to Bank of Ireland that our sponsorship activity aligns with and supports our core values, and reflects positively on Bank of Ireland through association,” a BoI statement said. “We understand that an internal review is under way. We expect this review to be robust, to fully address the issues raised, and that decisions will be taken – and policies and protocols be put in place – that fully address the issues that have arisen.”Following the conclusion of the trial on March 28th when both men were cleared of all charges, and two of their friends were also acquitted on related charges, Ulster and the IRFU said they were conducting an internal review into the two players who have been “relieved of all duties” since the legal process began. The degrading and offensive WhatsApp messages exchanged between the players and their friends, including another rugby player Craig Gilroy, who is also subject to the internal review over a message he sent Mr Olding, were under intense scrutiny during the trial and since its conclusion.Street demonstrations have taken place in cities across Ireland, and a feminist protest planned for outside Ulster’s King Stadium in south Belfast is scheduled for Friday evening. King, which is headquartered in Cavan, is the main sponsor of Ulster Rugby. It has been a partner since 1999 and in the summer of 2014 announced a 10-year agreement for the naming rights of the stadium. A spokesman for the company did not respond to a number requests for a statement. A spokeswoman for main kit sponsor Kukri Sports said: “I have no comment.”A spokeswoman for another official shirt sponsor, BT, said: “As a sponsor of the team, we have been in contact with Ulster Rugby. “We note that the players concerned will continue to be relieved of all duties while the IRFU and Ulster Rugby internal review is under way, and we await the findings.”A spokesman for shirt sponsor Go Power said: “Our legal team have been liaising with their PR department.” All other “official” or “domestic” sponsors listed on the Ulster Rugby website were contacted by The Irish Times on Thursday. SONI (System Operator for Northern Ireland) spokeswoman Natasha Sayee said its concerns had been expressed to Ulster Rugby and it awaited the outcome of the review. “As sponsors of the Ulster Rugby Premiership, we seek to support the values of respect, integrity and inclusivity at community and grassroots level,” she said. “It is vital to SONI that the outcome of the review addresses all of these issues.”Danske Bank is the official sponsor of the Ulster Schools’ Cup competition held each year from November to March, plus the Girls Schools’ Cup and High Schools’ Trophy. A statement said: “Danske Bank has not taken a formal position on the matter, nor have we had any contact with Ulster Rugby.”A Moy Park spokeswoman said: “The company is an official supplier to Ulster Rugby. It would be inappropriate to comment further as Ulster Rugby and the IRFU are conducting an internal review.”A Dale Farm spokeswoman said: “Dale Farm fully respects Ulster Rugby and IRFU’s current internal investigation and as such is not in a position to comment on this matter.”An Ulster Carpets spokeswoman said: “Ulster Carpets are fully aware of the situation and will be awaiting the outcome of the review being carried out by Ulster Rugby and the IRFU before making any comment.”An Abbey Insurance spokeswoman said: “Thank you for the opportunity, but at this stage Abbey Insurance is not making any comment in relation to this matter.”A Deep River Rock spokeswoman said it would not be commenting on this matter. A Maxol spokesperson said: “Maxol sponsors the Ulster Mini Rugby Festivals programme which aims to give young players aged 6 - 12 years old their first taste of the sport as well as learning the basic skills that go behind it. On other matters we don’t feel it is appropriate to comment at this time.”A response from the following companies was not available at the time of publication: Subway Ernst and Young Bavarian A\u0026ampL Goodbody Tobermore Concrete Products Ltd Fonacab Argento CD Group Heineken Millar McCall Wylie First Trust Bank and Kerr’s Tyres.An Ulster Rugby statement said: “The IRFU and Ulster Rugby have advised that a review process in relation to this matter is underway and it would be inappropriate to comment on any matter pertaining to that process until it is completed.”In the “sponsorship opportunities” section of the Ulster Rugby website it says it and the IRFU Ulster Branch are “committed to building a team from grass roots level up, making this the perfect opportunity for sponsors keen to harness a community ethos, not just in Northern Ireland but with border counties in Ulster”.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

But if Mr Senftleben did open talks with the AfD, it could cause a crisis for Mrs Merkel. Germany has a federal system like the US, which means regional governments have considerable power, and for the AfD to win a share of power would be seen as a major breakthrough for the party.Mr Senftleben was immediately slapped down by the national CDU leadership, in a phone call from Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the party chairman, who is widely seen as Mrs Merkel’s chosen successor. “We are sticking to a clear demarcation both on the right and to the left, which I made clear in a to the Brandenburg CDU leader,” Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer told reporters.The CDU is currently in opposition in the state, and Mr Senftleben appears to be trying to give himself the best opportunity of winning power. He also said he was open to talks with the Left Party, a successor to the East German communist party currently boycotted by the CDU.But he said he would not consider any deal with the AfD under its current regional leader in Brandenburg, Andreas Kalbitz, who he said had “links to the far-Right”.The AfD reacted coolly to his advances. “The AfD alone decides about its personnel,” a spokesman said.Please review our commenting policyPotato, bamboo and carrot fibre: the hidden ingredients in supermarket pestoFreemasons\u0026#39 symbol will appear on fire engines after controversial donation Two historic golds for Scotland at Commonwealth Games as record medals tally risesComment: If the West does not act against Assad and Putin now, their lies will have wonMasterChef: the final, review: Whose culinary skills saw them walk away with the trophy? Sir Cliff Richard tells High Court he has been \u0026#39forever tainted\u0026#39 by BBC\u0026#39s coverage of police search at his homeBomb disposal experts at prison in Peterborough amid ongoing incidentComment: Take it from an alcoholic: drinking is worth dying early forDonald Trump pardons Dick Cheney\u0026#39s former adviser \u0026#39Scooter\u0026#39 Libby, convicted of perjury\u0026#39Beatles\u0026#39 terrorist suspected of helping to plot drive-by executions of British police and soldiers, it emergesWhite House in turmoil amid fears FBI seized tapes of conversations between Donald Trump and his lawyerCampers wait outside Lindo Wing ready for new royal babyXi Jinping plans live-fire drills in Taiwan Strait after biggest naval exercises in China\u0026#39s historyComment: Will the BBC broadcasting Enoch Powell\u0026#39s Rivers of Blood speech do us any harm?

Initially, emergency rations included only rice, vegetable oil and lentils. Ms Leidman warned that the coming rainy season, which normally starts between April and June, could make the situation worse.She said some of the feeding centres were in areas that could flood and, although steps were being taken to prevent the worst effects of the flooding, it was unclear what impact the monsoon would have on vital services.The rainy season also presents a greater risk of waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, typhoid, hepatitis, malaria and dengue.Ms Leidman added: “The possibility of an outbreak of infectious disease can exacerbate malnutrition. In a malnourished population the disease severity and duration of an infectious disease can be much greater.”Researchers are now conducting a follow-up study to assess whether the nutritional situation has changed.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Potato, bamboo and carrot fibre: the hidden ingredients in supermarket pestoFreemasons\u0026#39 symbol will appear on fire engines after controversial donation Two historic golds for Scotland at Commonwealth Games as record medals tally risesComment: If the West does not act against Assad and Putin now, their lies will have wonMasterChef: the final, review: Whose culinary skills saw them walk away with the trophy? Sir Cliff Richard tells High Court he has been \u0026#39forever tainted\u0026#39 by BBC\u0026#39s coverage of police search at his homeBomb disposal experts at prison in Peterborough amid ongoing incidentComment: Take it from an alcoholic: drinking is worth dying early forDonald Trump pardons Dick Cheney\u0026#39s former adviser \u0026#39Scooter\u0026#39 Libby, convicted of perjuryPolitician from Angela Merkel\u0026#39s party \u0026#39open to talks with AfD\u0026#39\u0026#39Beatles\u0026#39 terrorist suspected of helping to plot drive-by executions of British police and soldiers, it emergesWhite House in turmoil amid fears FBI seized tapes of conversations between Donald Trump and his lawyerCampers wait outside Lindo Wing ready for new royal babyXi Jinping plans live-fire drills in Taiwan Strait after biggest naval exercises in China\u0026#39s historyComment: Will the BBC broadcasting Enoch Powell\u0026#39s Rivers of Blood speech do us any harm?

Mr McCabe says that when he believed his answers to the inspector general were misunderstood, he went back and tried to correct them.His lawyer says the inspector general unfairly tried to conclude its work before Mr McCabe could retire with a full pension.The report is sure to give additional fodder for President Donald Trump\u0027s public attacks on Mr McCabe.James Comey, the former FBI director whose new book paints a damning portrait of Donald TrumpThe president has made a concerted and Twitter-driven effort to impugn Mr McCabe as a partisan hack, accusing him of covering up unspecified \u0026quotlies and corruption\u0026quot at the FBI and calling his firing a \u0026quotgreat day for Democracy.\u0026quotMr McCabe has fired back, saying his dismissal was part of the Trump administration\u0027s \u0026quotongoing war\u0026quot on the FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller\u0027s Russia investigation.The report was sent to congressional committees and obtained by The Associated Press.The inspector general\u0027s finding led FBI disciplinary officials to recommend that the Justice Department fire Mr McCabe.Donald Trump, the US president, frequently criticised Mr McCabe before his firingAttorney General Jeff Sessions dismissed him last month two days before his scheduled retirement for what he described as a lack of candor.Mr McCabe also has said he believes he was singled out because of the \u0026quotrole I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath\u0026quot of Mr Comey\u0027s firing.To support this, Mr McCabe has noted that the inspector general\u0027s investigation into him was accelerated after he told congressional investigators that he could corroborate Mr Comey\u0027s accounts of his conversations with Trump.Mr McCabe, who is close to Comey, could be an important witness for Mueller, who is investigating Trump for possible obstruction of justice, including his motivation for firing Mr Comey in May 2017.The Associated Press has also confirmed that Mr McCabe kept personal memos detailing interactions with the president and they have been provided to the special counsel\u0027s office.Mr Trump reacted on Twitter: Please review our commenting policyPotato, bamboo and carrot fibre: the hidden ingredients in supermarket pestoFreemasons\u0026#39 symbol will appear on fire engines after controversial donation Two historic golds for Scotland at Commonwealth Games as record medals tally risesComment: If the West does not act against Assad and Putin now, their lies will have wonMasterChef: the final, review: Whose culinary skills saw them walk away with the trophy? Sir Cliff Richard tells High Court he has been \u0026#39forever tainted\u0026#39 by BBC\u0026#39s coverage of police search at his homeBomb disposal experts at prison in Peterborough amid ongoing incidentComment: Take it from an alcoholic: drinking is worth dying early forDonald Trump pardons Dick Cheney\u0026#39s former adviser \u0026#39Scooter\u0026#39 Libby, convicted of perjuryPolitician from Angela Merkel\u0026#39s party \u0026#39open to talks with AfD\u0026#39\u0026#39Beatles\u0026#39 terrorist suspected of helping to plot drive-by executions of British police and soldiers, it emergesWhite House in turmoil amid fears FBI seized tapes of conversations between Donald Trump and his lawyerCampers wait outside Lindo Wing ready for new royal babyXi Jinping plans live-fire drills in Taiwan Strait after biggest naval exercises in China\u0026#39s historyComment: Will the BBC broadcasting Enoch Powell\u0026#39s Rivers of Blood speech do us any harm?

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In part this was for its symbolism, but it also meant he could be home with his family by Easter Day.Tony Blair and the Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 (PA)Those who signed up called it the Good Friday Agreement those forced reluctantly to accept its terms still call it merely the Belfast Agreement. Its terms have come to be a guarantor of peace – or as near to it as Northern Ireland ever comes – for 20 years. Now is a curious time to threaten it.Yet the lessons of history are repeatedly forgotten, or disregarded by those who find them inconvenient for their present circumstances. In Blair’s more recent words, it is an “irresponsibility that is frankly sickening” that there are British politicians who would “sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit”.His views are shared by his predecessor, the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who engaged with and edged along the politically precarious process of engagement with the IRA. But opposition from his own party’s right wing meant only a Labour prime minister could carry it through to fruition.April 2018, with an uncertain Brexit hovering over the graveyards, is an apposite moment to recall the grim origins of the ‘peace process’, which lie in part in a particularly gory incident on the streets of Belfast that brought home to the British public the horror that most have since preferred to forget.It was shortly after noon on Friday 19 March 1988, two weeks before Good Friday. Father Alec Reid, a Catholic priest, was walking down Andersonstown Road when he heard angry shouts and animal-like screams mounting in murderous crescendo.Two British army corporals had apparently accidentally driven into the path of the funeral procession of an IRA member, himself killed by a loyalist gunman at a funeral three days earlier. Fearing a repeat attack, the crowd set upon the two soldiers, who were wearing civilian clothes, in their car. One of the soldiers drew his service pistol and fired in the air. They were dragged from the car.The men were overpowered, beaten and stripped. They were then shot dead on a patch of wasteland next to Andersonstown social club.Footage of the incident shocked the world. But with it came an image of compassion: a Catholic priest, grief etched on his face, ministering to one of the British soldiers in death. Few who looked upon that scene were aware that a regular visitor to Reid’s confessional was a former barman named Gerry Adams.Father Alec Reid giving last rites to one of the two soldiers killed by a mob at the funeral of an IRA member shot by loyalist gunman Michael Stone (Rex)Indeed, Reid was already by this time acting as a go-between for Adams, the leader of the IRA, and John Hume, head of the moderate nationalist SDLP. The incident on the Andersonstown Road strengthened his determination to bring about an alliance between the two men. Staggeringly, it emerged years later that he was carrying a message from Adams to Hume on the day of the killings.  The IRA were understandably toxic to British politicians. The aim was to bring them in from the cold. Hume was a republican but respectable. The theory was that he might be able to convey to London what it would take to make the IRA call off their campaign of violence.The most difficult issue was the IRA’s total refusal to recognise an inner-Ireland border guarded by soldiers and armed police. (Sound familiar?)I understood all this. I had grown up in Northern Ireland had lost two schoolfriends to the IRA. I was also aware of what had led to the violence: my Protestant grandfather had been a landlord who had three votes in local elections, while his Catholic tenants had none.Talking to Adams represented a political risk for Hume. Reid orchestrated secret meetings at Clonard Monastery on the ‘peace line’ in Belfast, where the 20ft-high wall had a statue of the Virgin Mary on one side and a ‘No Surrender’ mural on the other.The IRA top command had started to realise they might not convince the British government to ‘sell out’ the wishes of nearly one million citizens in Northern Ireland at the barrel of a gun. The slogan ‘Armalite in one hand and ballot box in the other’, coined by Danny Morrison in 1981, was being called into question.On the other hand, Peter Brooke, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1989 and 1992, admitted military defeat of the IRA was ‘difficult to envisage’.Still, many at the top of the IRA now believed London’s insistence – communicated publicly by Brooke – that it laid no claim to the six counties other than respecting the wishes of a majority of its people.Peter Brooke played an important role as Northern Ireland secretary (Reuters)Reid was also in regular contact with Irish taoiseach Charles Haughey. Brooke, meanwhile, set up shop in Stormont and held regular talks with Dublin politicians. Soon after taking up his post he had been briefed on the existence of a back channel between Michael Oatley, an MI6 agent, codenamed ‘Mountain Climber’, and the IRA’s hard man Martin McGuinness he authorised it to be continued.The word ‘clarification’ bounced back and forth in the game of semantics versus reality, the perpetual hallmark of Anglo-Irish relations. There were regular calls between Dublin wordsmith Martin Mansergh and Northern Ireland Office man John Chilcot (later to become known for overseeing the inquiry into the Iraq War) in an attempt to find common ground.Palace coups played their part in bringing matters to a head. First, Margaret Thatcher was ousted by her party, then Haughey by his. The ‘Iron Lady’ and ‘The Boss’ were gone. In their places were the less intimidating and more amenable John Major and Albert Reynolds.Ex-PM John Major tears into May’s ‘grand folly’ Brexit strategyIn February 1993 Major was looking over papers in the Cabinet Room when he was informed that there was a phone call for him from the IRA, possibly McGuinness himself. “The conflict is over, but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.” Major decided to take the call seriously.A bomb in Warrington a few weeks later, which killed two children, nearly destroyed everything, until the IRA, chastened by their own wives and mothers, confidentially apologised: they had uncontrollable hardliners too. Indeed, in October, a bungled attack on a loyalist paramilitary office above a chip shop killed nine. A retaliation Halloween attack on a Catholic pub killed eight.But the forces of reason still rang out loud. By December, Major and Reynolds agreed what became known as the Downing Street Declaration, containing most of the points that would later be embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. The response was hesitant, but in August 1994 the IRA declared a ‘cessation of hostilities’.It seemed Major’s gamble had paid off, even if at a rally outside Belfast City Hall in August 1995 Gerry Adams was cheered when he declared: “They haven’t gone away, you know.”John Hume with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness during talksIn November, US President Bill Clinton addressed another Belfast rally and announced Senator George Mitchell as his ‘special envoy’ to the peace talks.Mitchell declared his strategy to be a twin track of talks and moves towards arms decommissioning. The two main unionist parties, the UUP and the more hardline DUP, refused to attend negotiations. Sinn Fein were refused entry. The political wings of unionist paramilitaries, however, were allowed in.In late 1997 I sat with David Ervine, a former UVF man jailed for possession of explosives, now a member of their political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, in a north Belfast bar. Guinness dripped from his moustache as he shared his changed views:“Pope John Paul II is a nice old Polish bloke it doesn’t do anybody any good going around shouting he is the antichrist.“If you want to make peace with men with guns,” he went on, “you have to talk to those who represent the men with guns.”The British government had initially done that with one side but not the other. As a result, the IRA ceasefire ended abruptly on 9 February 1996 when a bomb in London’s Canary Wharf financial district killed two and wounded more than 100.Allegations of foot-dragging were exchanged by both sides. In June, elections were held for a Northern Ireland Forum. Sinn Fein won 17 of 110 seats but refused to take up membership of what it considered a puppet British institution.The IRA caused huge damage in the Docklands bombing of 1996 (Reuters)Sure enough, the day after the Forum’s first meeting, the IRA gave its clear verdict: a 1,500 kilo bomb (the biggest in Britain since the end of World War Two) wiped out a large portion of Manchester city centre. A 90-minute warning saw 75,000 people evacuated from the area, and while there were no fatalities hundreds were injured.Again, though, a change of government put talks back on track. In May 1997 John Major handed the keys of 10 Downing Street to Tony Blair, a Labour leader who didn’t have to cope with the hard right wingers Major himself called “bastards”.Blair’s new Northern Ireland minister Mo Mowlam issued the long-awaited invitation to Sinn Fein to join the talks. In July, the IRA announced a renewed ceasefire.Cameron was right to ‘tell the truth’ on Bloody Sunday: Introducing anCrucially, in January 1998 Blair announced a fresh public inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Derry, in which 14 unarmed citizens were shot dead by British troops. Its conclusions, finally revealed in 2010, exonerated Martin McGuinness from involvement and blamed British paratroopers for firing first.Compromises paid off. A legally binding agreement, involving both British and Irish governments and echoing the 1993 Downing Street Declaration, was at last on the cards. The wording was designed to be a classic agreement to differ, to promise everything to everyone.The key elements were a mutual renunciation of violation, and assurances that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its citizens wanted it to – but could in principle become part of the Irish Republic if a majority desired it in the future.The provisions were put to referendums on both sides of the border. In the Republic, more than 94 per cent of a 56 per cent turnout voted ‘yes’, in the north 71 per cent voted ‘yes’ on a turnout of 81 per cent. There was no official breakdown of the ethnic pattern in the north independent observers reckoned it was overwhelming in republican circles but marginal among unionist voters.Of Northern Ireland’s nine political parties, eight signed up to the agreement. Only one, the DUP, refused (a fact Theresa May might have missed in 2017 when she welcomed the party as an ally to prop up her minority government).Ireland amended its constitution to remove the claim that the territory of the state was the ‘whole island’. In return Britain repealed the symbolic but obsolete 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which still nominally implied similar territorial claims.Ian Paisley, left, and Martin McGuinness developed a surprisingly close relationship when they led the Northern Ireland Assembly (Getty)The European Union ploughed money into north-south Irish infrastructure, including a motorway from Dublin to Belfast. The single market and customs union meant border posts disappeared, and so did the armed men who guarded them.The early days were difficult. The old ‘moderate parties’ – the UUP and SDLP – initially dominated the new Northern Ireland Assembly, including by taking up the roles of first and deputy first minister. But after arguments broke out in 2001, the assembly was ultimately suspended by Westminster and Northern Ireland reverted to direct rule from London until a new agreement and the Assembly’s restoration in 2007.This time, as David Ervine had predicted, the real power brokers were to be found in the driving seat: the DUP veteran firebrand Ian Paisley and ex-IRA man Martin McGuinness.Against all odds, they not only agreed to work together but found points in common to the extent that they became something like friends, nicknamed ‘the Chuckle Brothers’. It was everything and more than the script writers of the Good Friday Agreement had dared dream of.Decommissioning of weapons, overseen by two American politicians and two generals, one Canadian, one Finnish, went on until 2005, by which time the international committee reckoned the IRA had done away with an armoury that included some 1,000 rifles, three tonnes of Semtex, and 20-30 heavy machine guns.Irish border joins orce bill on pile of reasons for Brexit deadlockIn the current Brexit context it is interesting to consider how British membership of the Euro currency – to which Ireland of course signed up – would have meant an even less obvious border between north and south.It wasn’t to happen though: British politicians treated the issue as done and dusted, and forgot the price.There is a belief among some Ulster Unionists – just as there is among many Brexiteers – that any risk is worth taking, any outcome acceptable, as long as it achieves the sole important aim: in the former case staying in a union in the latter, getting out of one.Kate Hoey, the pro-foxhunting Labour MP who has more in common with the DUP than her own party, is one of those who straddles both those camps. The Antrim-born Brexit supporter has said she would “do anything” to ensure Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the UK. She also caused outrage by suggesting that if Brexit did mean a hard border in Ireland, then it would have to be the EU – and thus the Irish – who would pay for it (on the basis that the British have no desire to erect one).Hoey and others like her give the strong impression of being dyed-in-the wool members of what was once the ‘protestant ascendancy’ who, like their forefathers, see British rule as a guarantee of superiority on their home turf.Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe Good Friday Agreement questioned that assumption Northern Ireland’s demographic shift in the years since is moving it towards breaking point. Unionist parties lost their outright majority at Stormont in Assembly elections just over a year ago. How long will it be till a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would prefer to see their future as part of Ireland, not the UK?  Set against this backdrop, Brexit looked to many unionists like locking a fire safety door.That classic guide to British history up to 1918, Sellar’s and Yeatman’s ‘1066 and all that’, declared: “Gladstone tried all his life to guess the answer to the Irish question. Unfortunately, whenever he was getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the question.”This time it is the British who have changed the question.And nobody knows the answer.The Northern Ireland we know today was born in 1920 as part of a solution to long-running Irish ‘home rule’ demands, by creating two separate jurisdictions on the island, both still within the UK.It was a selective gerrymandering designed to perpetuate the rights of a pro-British, mainly Protestant ‘ascendancy’ within six of the nine counties of the historical province of Ulster, while giving discrete home rule to the south.It was not just too little too late, but way past its sell-by date. The scheme had been thrown into chaos by the First World War, the 1916 Easter Rising and its bloody suppression, then Sinn Fein’s 1918 landslide election and declaration of independence.The status of the ‘six counties’ was a major factor in the ensuing civil war over the new country’s status. But the deal survived and an imposing neo-classical parliament building was erected at Stormont on the outskirts of Belfast.Within their new Northern Irish fiefdom, with its built-in two-thirds majority rights, the Protestant-dominated government for the next 40 years oversaw a regime which frequently discriminated against the pro-Irish, largely Catholic minority. Prejudice was evident in housing, employment and voting rights, among other areas.The status quo was maintained by an almost exclusively Protestant armed police force that gloried in its ‘Royal’ Ulster Constabulary title and had a paramilitary wing known as the ‘B-Specials’, used against street riots in the 1930s and in the suppression of an IRA campaign in the 1950s.After renewed civil rights marches in the late 1960s led to further riots, brutally put down, regular British troops were sent to Northern Ireland and the ‘Specials’ were disbanded.A split within the IRA in 1969 had created the more militant ‘Provisional’ wing, which began a violent campaign both in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Stormont’s response was internment without trial and a declaration that it was “at war”.In January 1972 British soldiers shot dead 13 people in (London)Derry, which would become known as Bloody Sunday. In response the British embassy in Dublin was burnt down. Two months later direct rule from London was imposed on Northern Ireland.Father Edward Daly (who became Bishop of Derry) leads casualties to safety on Bloody Sunday (Belfast Telegraph)Unionists at first considered this a blow but came to realise direct rule actually reinforced the province’s British status. The IRA stepped up its campaign, leading to a virtual civil war, with British troops considered to be on the side of the unionists.The death toll on both sides of the Irish Sea soared into thousands, with no end in sight. It was against that background that forces of sanity plucked the Good Friday Agreement seemingly from nowhere, persuading both sides that this was the only way to ensure peace and security for the foreseeable future.But the foreseeable future is hostage to demographics. In the 2017 elections, after the polarising Brexit vote, the combined unionist lobby lost their majority for the first time. The hardline DUP lost 10 seats, talking a total of 28, just one more than Sinn Fein.The Good Friday Agreement’s promise to both sides that Northern Ireland’s future would be determined by the wishes of the majority may eventually point towards a vote for Irish unity.As things stand, few would see the point of posing such a potentially explosive question. But Brexit and the possibility of a ‘hard border’ between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could put all sorts of options back on the table.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She received a flurry of responses from people saying they were shocked and surprised.“They didn’t know this was a thing that happened they always knew me as being British,” she said.Friends persuaded her to create a GoFundMe petition to raise funds for her citizenship application, and within the first 20 hours she had raised half the money needed.

There is an issue in terms of what they class someone as British is – it’s very vague.

Not only do you have to meet that criteria but you have to pay the ridiculous funds as well. Not every has access to those kind of funds.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesEngland\u0027s Katarina Johnson-Thompson celebrates after winning the heptathlon with compatriot and bronze medal winner Niamh Emerson during the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast in Australia.Quaker Alan Pinch makes tea for passers-by as he holds a protest in Manchester against UK military intervention in SyriaA man pulls the flowers down from a fence opposite the house of Richard Osborn-Brooks in South Park Crescent in Hither Green, London.

He should have had the decency to refer himself rather than sweep this under the carpet.”The health secretary said his failure to declare a business interest with both Companies House and the parliamentary register of MPs interests was down to “honest administrative mistakes” and that he did not gain financially as a result.A spokeswoman for Mr Hunt said: “These were honest administrative mistakes which have already been rectified.“Jeremy’s accountant made an error in the Companies House filing which was a genuine oversight.“With respect to ministerial and parliamentary declarations, the Cabinet Office are clear that there has been no breach of the ministerial code.“Jeremy declared the interest to them after the company was set up.“They advised that, as it was a shell company with no assets or value, it should only be registered when it became operational.“As such, Jeremy presumed the same rules applied to parliamentary declarations.“Although there was no personal gain involved, Jeremy accepts these mistakes are his responsibility and has apologised to the parliamentary authorities.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesEngland\u0027s Katarina Johnson-Thompson celebrates after winning the heptathlon with compatriot and bronze medal winner Niamh Emerson during the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast in Australia.Quaker Alan Pinch makes tea for passers-by as he holds a protest in Manchester against UK military intervention in SyriaA man pulls the flowers down from a fence opposite the house of Richard Osborn-Brooks in South Park Crescent in Hither Green, London.

He suggested the leader’s obsession with tweeting deflected attention away from positive stories about the economy.A slew of polls in recent weeks have shown Democrats with a lead over Republicans. A Quinnipiac University poll released last month showed Democrats holding a 10-point lead.In the House, 435 seats are up for election in the forthcoming midterms. The Republicans in that chamber currently hold 238 seats and the Democrats have 192 but are predicted to procure more. The Democrats need to flip 23 seats in order to take back the House.But the Senate is a far trickier political landscape - 35 seats are up in the 2018 elections there. The Democrats need to defend their existing 26 of those seats and win two extras in order to take control of the chamber. Donald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesDonald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesUS President Donald Trump acknowledges the audience after taking the oath of office as his wife Melania (L) and daughter Tiffany watch during inauguration ceremonies swearing in Trump as the 45th president of the United States on the West Front of the US capital in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jim Bourg: This photo was shot with one of two remote cameras. The cameras were monitored and triggered remotely and the pictures were transmitted to clients worldwide within minutes of being taken.US President Barack Obama wipes away tears as he delivers his farewell address in Chicago on 10 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: In his final days in office, Obama made a visit home to Chicago. As he spoke from the stage to his wife and daughter in the audience, he became emotional when he talked about what they had sacrificed during his time in office. I turned from photographing the Obama women embracing to find him onstage wiping away tears. A combination of photos shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01pm (left) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama sometime between 12:07pm and 12:26pm on January 20, 2009. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump attend the Liberty Ball in honour of his inauguration in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: What I see when I look at this picture is the end of a very long day, not to mention weeks and months of preparation by many photographers, editors and network experts and the beginning of everything since. US President Donald Trump greets Director of the FBI James Comey as Director of the Secret Service Joseph Clancy (L), watches during the Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House on 22 January, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room.US President Donald Trump, is joined by his staff, as he speaks by phone with Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office on 28 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump\u0027s second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u0027s office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn\u0027t even think about it twice. We\u0027ll do it! he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: We\u0027re often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone. Germany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on 17 March, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival. Surrounded by secret service agents Trump walked from the Air Force One and raised his hand in a sign of victory as the crowd cheered him on.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (L) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus watch as US President Donald Trump presents the U.S. Air Force Academy football team with the Commander-in-Chief trophy in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington on 2 May, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump wait the arrival of French President Emmanuel Macron (unseen) before a lunch ahead of a NATO Summit in Brussels on 25 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Democrats believe that with Mr Trump’s approval at a record low and with a similarly record number of candidates from its party getting ready to run in November, they will be able to capitalise on anti-Trump sentiment and retake one or both chambers of Congress. Former vice president Joe Biden recently argued Democrats would win back the House and maybe even the Senate in Autumn.“We’re going to win back the House. We actually have a chance at winning back the Senate, for real. It’s a little more of a climb, but it’s real,” Mr Biden said in February.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?
