Across England, infections also rose in every region.But the country\u0027s biggest Covid symptom-tracking study yesterday claimed infections in the UK grew by just four per cent last week despite warnings Omicron is quickly outstripping Delta.King\u0027s College London scientists estimated 83,658 people caught the virus on average each day in the week to December 4, up from 80,483 the seven days prior. Cases are stagnant or falling in all over-55s thanks to the booster rollout but are rising in all younger age groups, especially children who make up about 30,000 daily cases alone, they said. Broken down within the UK, London, the South East and Wales saw cases rise.Professor Tim Spector, who leads the ZOE symptom study, said that while it was too early to see Omicron in the data, he warned the NHS could be overwhelmed if cases of the super-strain begin to skyrocket as predicted.He said the evidence — alongside claims it may be more mild than other strains — was no reason to be \u0027relaxed\u0027, adding: \u0027The higher rate of transmission even in the vaccinated could have devastating consequences...

Video: Enda O\u0027DowdAngeline Ruddy, deputy principal of Moville Community College: ‘It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips... There’s no getting away from mica’. Photograph: Enda O’DowdAt Moville Community College, everybody is talking about mica.“There’s not an English essay that’s passed to a teacher that doesn’t have a mention of mica in it somewhere... and every time you mention humanitarian issues it’s the first thing to the forefront,” says deputy principal Angeline Ruddy.“It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips,” she says. “There’s no escaping it. There’s no getting away from mica.”The presence of the mineral in construction blocks – which makes them crack and eventually crumble – has caused structural damage to an estimated 7,500 homes in counties Donegal and Mayo, as well as smaller numbers in other counties.Mica has impacted the entire community, says principal Anthony Doogan, and the school community is no different.At Moville Community College approximately 20 per cent of staff and 25 per cent of pupils – about 20 staff and 100 families – are living in “mica homes” even more have siblings and parents who are affected.“I have five siblings, and four of them are affected by mica,” says Ruddy. The one who isn’t lives in the US.“Where I live, in a half mile radius, 20 houses are affected. It’s everywhere we go.”Her children “know nothing else but a mica household” as they go about their daily routine, mica is “like an app running in the background for every one of us.“‘Is the house safe tonight?’ is a regular question my children will ask,” she says. “I have cracks that are now the width of a two-euro coin, which means my gable is starting to move away from the wall of my house. I don’t know, really, if we are safe any longer.”Others tell a similar story. Special needs assistant Barry Moore’s home is crumbling his daughter was riding her bike around the house when “a lump of plaster fell off... it was near enough to scare her, and me.”“You’re lying at home at night and you hear the walls moving. It’s scary, to think you’re living in a place that is meant to be your safe place and you’re hearing the walls cracking.”Five of the special needs assistants – nearly half of the special needs staff – have mica homes, and so do some of the students they support. A hoist used by one child is attached to a crumbling mica wall, while foster parents have bought two mobile homes to house their children with complex needs.“They need routine, they need to know what happening... they’re going to be moved into two mobile homes behind their house and watch their house getting knocked down,” says Moore.In school, he says, you can “see the children who have mica, or whose houses have mica. They are, like their parents probably are, nearly obsessed with the fact they have mica.“As staff you’re trying to accommodate and support children... but they’re going home to houses that aren’t safe and that are causing them grief and stress.”Guidance counsellor Sineád McCarron’s home also has mica she warns of “what’s coming down the line... this is just going to explode, really, in terms of the amount of support the students need.”As principal, Doogan has significant concerns about the physical and mental health of students and staff – not least through heightened levels of anxiety – and about the impact on students’ attendance and life chances the effects, he estimates, will persist for the next five to 10 years.The anxiety of students and parents “is having an impact on their work rate and their effectiveness at their studies at school,” he says.“Every secondary school in the country”, he emphasises, has seen the effects of Covid “We’re at the beginning of this cycle for mica and in two years’ time, when there’s a large number of houses in this community which need to be demolished and rebuilt, there will be severe anxiety and perhaps worse felt by a lot of our students.”There is also “clear evidence” of an increase in absenteeism due to illness – “they’re living in draughty rooms, the rooms are colder, the rooms are causing them health issues that they wouldn’t ordinarily have” as well as students from mica homes who have left school altogether.Brother and sister Shaun and Aoife Noone describe how their home is “falling down”: “If I put my hand in the wall I could just pull away some of the side of the house,” says 17-year-old Shaun.They have moved out so that their home can be demolished and rebuilt. “I don’t really have a study room so that’s affecting my study, because I’m doing my Leaving Cert now, and it’s harder to focus and settle down and get work done,” he says.“I feel disadvantaged, it’s unfair that most people would stress or be anxious about exams but I’ve got the pressure of my house on top of that, so it’s a bit hard on the mind as well.”Aaron Price (13) and his family have also moved out. “It was a lot to handle trying to go to school and do homework and trying to empty the house.”The Government this week announced a €2.2 billion scheme to rebuild mica homes in Donegal and Mayo, capped at €420,000 per home and with a sliding scale of rebuilding costs from €145 per sq ft for the first 1,000 sq ft to €110 for the next 1,000 and €100 thereafter.It has been criticised by the mica campaigners in Donegal as falling short. “Apparently a new scheme was decided but it’s stupid, apparently each square metre gets less money, that doesn’t make sense,” says Aaron.“We need 100 per cent, and I know we probably will never get that, but if it was in Dublin, this would already be fixed.“It’s not our fault, we spent a lot of money on building our house... why should we have to spend more and more money rebuilding our house?”The adults have done the figures each of those spoken to by The  is facing a shortfall of between €60,000 to €80,000. “If council houses are being built at the minute they are built on a rate of €150 a square metre,” says Moore. “What was being offered would work out essentially for our house at €127 a square metre, which would leave us paying €65,000 on top of what we would get.“My other half is a psychiatric nurse, we’re no millionaires, we’re working-class people and we live in an average size house in Donegal which is the average in the country for a one-off build, 2,500 sq ft.“If they had dropped the sliding scale part... 145 euro per square foot, that’s it, and then your rent and then your storage, I would say 90 per cent of people would have been happy and celebrating, but they put in a scale that doesn’t exist in any builder’s pricing.”“The cost to me right now is €79,000, and that’s just for the build,” says Ruddy. “My house is 2,600 sq ft... that gives a total of €315,000 of a grant. The builders have come back to me with €395,000.“I can’t borrow because I have a mica home... 100 per cent redress is so far from it, I don’t think I’m even getting 80 per cent redress.“My children are at the stage where I should be starting to save for their college. Am I going to build their house and deprive them of education? We’re facing these choices.”“People bought the material in good faith... yet they are being victimised to the extent of having to spend 40, 50, 60, €80,000, whereas other areas were given 100 per cent redress,” says Doogan.For him, it is about the value placed on people from this area, not least given that the school itself is still “nowhere near completion” 20 years after it opened. “We bailed out the banks for €64 billion, and they’re saying three or four billion is a huge amount of money, but it’s less than five per cent of what we gave to the banks.“The people up here paid their taxes to pay for the bank bailout, and people here, like me, paid their taxes to pay for the pyrite redress in Dublin and Leinster. People round here are saying, ‘is there a different law for us?’”McCarron, too, is clear: “How can we help people look after their wellbeing and instil value systems of fair justice when our own Government continues to let this happen?”“They’ve let us down,” says 15-year-old Aoife. “If this was happening in Dublin, I feel it would be a different story, because we’re that far away and we’re rural they say ‘ah, them Donegal ones, they live in big mansions, they can afford it’. We can’t. We need our houses fixed.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"nphet is the beast government created but can it be tamed","story":"Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan with   Prof Philip Nolan,   Rachel Kenna and Dr Ronan Glynn. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins The words coming out of Dr Tony Holohan’s mouth could not have been clearer: do not leak this information at all, and absolutely do not breathe a word before the Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly has been told.It was last Thursday afternoon and Nphet was wrapping up a meeting in which it agreed to recommend a series of additional restrictions in the lead-up to Christmas.Going to “great pains”, Holohan declared: “This cannot leak before Stephen Donnelly sees it, and Stephen Donnelly can’t see it until late because he is in the Dáil. He almost said I beg you, he said I am pleading with you, do not.”Extra safeguards were put in place.This time the official letter which is sent from the Chief Medical Officer’s office to Donnelly would not even be sent digitally by email. Instead, in the gloom of the winter night, an official was dispatched from the Department of Health to hand-deliver it to Donnelly, who had been on his feet in the Dáil all evening.By the time that official stepped out into the rain, however, most of the details were already being reported by major news outlets. The information was out before the letter had even been put to paper.There was “absolutely huge annoyance about this,” a Government source said. The thinking was, “this is not the way to do business.”What followed the next day was a showdown between public health and Government, the likes of which had not been seen since the infamous Level 5 bombshell that dropped in October 2020.As people and businesses the length and breadth of the country fretted over the clearly imminent restrictions, the Minister for Justice, Helen McEntee, appeared on the country’s biggest radio show, RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, to discuss a scheme for undocumented migrants. She was tackled on the letter and asked what the Government’s plan would be.“It is not helpful that I am talking to you and I haven’t seen the letter,” she said twice.Even McEntee, a mild-mannered and level-headed politician, could not hide her evident frustration. Political insiders knew there was something brewing because, as one person put it, “that would not be Helen’s style”. She wasn’t alone.A meeting of the Cabinet Covid-19 subcommittee was hastily convened on Friday.‘Showdown’The point of the meeting was to discuss the advice with Holohan, but it descended into what multiple sources have described as a “showdown” in which politicians either “read them the riot act” or “exchanged angry words”, depending on who you talk to.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar was said to have been “clinically brutal” in his criticisms. The Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe, was angry too, along with McEntee and Minister for Arts Catherine Martin.Ministers wanted to know why they were effectively the last to hear these matters of huge significance and they wanted to know why this kept happening.There were other gripes festering: the previous evening Dr Cillian De Gascun appeared on RTÉ’s Drivetime programme. He was asked about whether schools might reopen in January. He answered haltingly at first but then said he would be hopeful it could happen.Added to the mix was a letter addressed by Holohan to parents around the country where he wrote about a “very high incidence in the as-yet-unvaccinated 5-11 year old age group” which was “a cause for some concern”.Ministers have often complained about feeling bounced into situations in a very public way by Nphet before they have had a chance to consider the implications, and this was the major bone of contention again.The upshot of the confrontation was that Nphet members were to be asked to route their planned interviews through the Government press office. All week, a narrative has been allowed to form that members of the public health team would need to get their permission slip signed before they could go on the radio or TV, raising the spectre of the team being silenced.But that is not how they see it.Free to talkSources on the team say they don’t believe they have been silenced and that they feel free to talk on radio whenever they please. They say it is the Government’s fault if it mishandled the communications of what its actual plan was – to provide Nphet members with the Government position before they go on air and to have clarity on who will be appearing where.“It is all a little bit of a manufactured storm. The Government are creating a problem that does not exist.”Sources say that if the Government wanted to make the overall message more coherent and ensure conflicting messages aren’t going out in public then they should have “built a change over time” instead of “having a hissy fit.”Some people on Nphet are undeterred others are confused most just plan on getting on with their jobs as they were.Pragmatically, many people on the team can understand why the issue came to a head.“I can see their issue. It is not okay to be on Morning Ireland not having seen the letter,” one figure said.On the other side of the fence, there is still aggravation. Government figures say that while Nphet meetings have been “leaky” for quite some time, they believe it has gone “to a whole new level” in recent weeks.There has been much chatter about uncovering the leak. On the Nphet side, members say that if anyone in Government has a suspicion about a serial leaker then they need to take that person aside and confront them because other members of the team feel their reputations are being affected by what is happening.It is clear there is paranoia in all quarters and a tug-of-war to re-establish where the power lies.Nphet has been referred to on more than one occasion as being the most powerful group of people in the country. Although it existed in different forms before 2020, it rose from relative obscurity to become one of the biggest beasts in the political jungle.Passenger seatThe question has been asked: how did Nphet become so dominant? And why is it that the Government always seems to be in the passenger seat when it comes to the big decisions?The answer is: because the Government made it so.In the very early days of the pandemic, on March 3rd, 2020, as the caretaker administration grappled with a decision on whether the St Patrick’s Day parade needed to be cancelled or not, the then minister for health, Simon Harris, said that any decisions made by the Government would be guided by public health and by science – “not by politics”.It became apparent within days exactly how serious the situation was and by March 19th the first major piece of legislation allowing for sweeping restrictions was brought before the Dáil. During that debate, Harris said that the requisite steps would not be taken “on the basis of a whim I or any of the other members may have”, but on the basis of “the best medical advice from the Chief Medical Officer so that we can do that and do it quickly. If the Department of Health and the Chief Medical Officer believe these powers are necessary in the time of a public health emergency, then I am with them all day long.”He added that “every decision that has been made by the National Public Health Emergency Team, which is chaired by the Chief Medical Officer, has been implemented in full.”At the end of April, five weeks into lockdown, Harris was asked about an imminent plan for the reopening of society.“We will follow public health advice first, second and third,” he said.From the very beginning of the pandemic, the power and centrality of Nphet was endorsed, emphasised and encouraged by Government.From a cursory reading of the minutes of the very first Nphet meetings, it is clear that its members did not see themselves as being the primary decision-makers. They talked about being a forum for advising on strategy and about how everything was deliberative until the Government made the final decisions.“No one knew what they were doing, the only people who had some semblance what they were doing was public health,” a source familiar with the situation said.“Even that was on a wing and a prayer. The Opposition were also part of the collective effort too. It is easy to blame the Government for allowing Nphet to take on a directive role but so did the Opposition. They were both in on it.“The Government didn’t have a choice because they didn’t have the knowledge, but it suited them as well politically to hide behind it and blame Nphet.”Simon Harris was regarded as having a close and effective relationship with both Tony Holohan and those in his office.The arrival of Stephen Donnelly as the new Minister for Health appears to have changed that dynamic.ProblematicHis critics inside the department paint him in a problematic light as someone who has struggled to maintain proper communication with the CMO and his team. They say there used to be clear lines of communication but now it has “triangulated”, with the Department of Taoiseach stepping in to take charge on occasion. Others say he went into the role ready to “interrogate” Nphet advice, “to question it, and to say no” when it was warranted.Regardless of any personal views, it is clear the new Government brought about a change in the relationship with Nphet at a time when we had learned a lot about the pandemic – and a lot about the cost politically, economically as well as socially.The relationship between Government and Nphet existed in two different worlds: the early and dark days of the pandemic when no one knew what was happening and the later days when the country had to find a way to live with Covid-19.This is still the world we are still living in and, despite plans to disband Nphet in October (which was apparently news to Holohan and his team), rising case numbers and the threat of the new Omicron variant mean we will be hearing from the public health team for some time to come.Ministers clearly have no Plan B for how to grapple with the coming weeks in relation to taking advice, and no alternative to Nphet. Some insiders believe that if the plan was to get the team to quieten down then this will backfire.This is because Nphet is the beast that the Government created and its expertise will be needed in the coming weeks if a more transmissible variant is about to take off. The Government knows it, and Nphet knows it too.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"yes we want to see a united ireland eventually but what s your hurry","story":"Sinn Féin voters are the most opposed to those measures – on the flag, anthem and joining the commonwealth – that might appeal to unionists.

Photograph:  Sally HaydenA new  series, Young Africans Rising, begins today with this report by Sally Hayden.When he was still in control of the Gambia, Africa’s smallest mainland country, Yahya Jammeh presided over a macabre kind of graduation. The eccentric dictator, who claimed he had discovered the cure for Aids, would bring infected people for treatment at his state house, smearing green paste on them, forcing them to drink herbal mixtures and banning them from taking their usual anti-retroviral drugs, before releasing them in televised ceremonies as he declared them cured.Sometimes, there was a foursome of young performers in attendance. Their job was to praise a man who they knew could have them, and everyone they knew, disappeared or killed.“He gave us money,” says Assan Jobe, now 26. “We were very young. We were not thinking about criticising him at that point.”Jammeh was ousted in 2016 after 22 years in power. He has not faced justice and lives in exile in Equatorial Guinea. Many of the Gambia’s banknotes still bear his face.This sliver of land in West Africa is known as the “smiling coast” because of its shape and positioning on maps. You can get an idea how small the Gambia is from the telephone numbers, which are just seven digits long. It has a population of roughly 2.4 million people, almost three-quarters of whom are under the age of 35. Over the past five years, they have adjusted to their newfound democracy and freedom of speech with the involvement of one key group of influencers: comedians.Bright Stars Entertainment is made up of four members, now in their mid- to late 20s. The young men, who met while they were volunteering with the Red Cross, say they no longer want to reflect on the past or what it was like growing up in a dictatorship.Speaking days before the Gambia’s December 4th election – the first since Jammeh left power – they say their focus is on whoever will be the new president, and they would be front and centre, protesting, before the country turned towards authoritarianism again.No-go zones included “the government itself the work of the government. Ridiculing them. Some of the things they were not doing.” Now, he says, “we believe we have the right to say anything” while making sure their jokes are based on “facts” and “respect”.“We don’t want to talk about Jammeh now, he has no influence over the country, we don’t even think about him . . . It was like we were sleeping. Never again,” says 27-year-old Pa Modou Yaffa. “Do you believe in oxygen? It’s so sweet. We enjoy breathing the oxygen of democracy.”SporadicIn another, they make fun of the sporadic electricity supply citizens were dealing with, which served less than half of the population. “It went viral,” says Yaffa. Shortly afterwards, a government deal with Turkish company Karpower was announced.Bright Stars Entertainment have more than 17,000 followers on Facebook, 15,700 on Instagram and more than 14,500 subscribers on YouTube. On TikTok they have racked up more than half a million views.We meet in Assan’s family home. Music videos play on a large TV in the sittingroom. Outside, his family sit together sharing a large bowl of food.The comedians complain that local TV stations regularly run their videos on air, but don’t pay them. “There are no royalties,” says Assan. “You will post it and in 10 seconds or one minute you will see it circulated,” says Yaffa.Instead, they make an income producing content for UN agencies, as well as earning performance fees for galas or weddings, writing theme songs for commercials and getting a small bit of money from YouTube. As we speak, another member, Buba A Jallow (stage name: Pa Furmose), gets a call asking them to perform at a bank’s staff party in January (he agrees to it). When they come together, they create sketches quickly, says Assan. “It’s four good heads, not four empty heads.”The only time they ever left the country was on a Red Cross-related trip to neighbouring Senegal. “We have content but we are left behind when it comes to the opportunities,” says Yaffa. “The plan for the future is to perform all over the world, bring the culture of Africa to America, to Europe, to Asia, to build a legacy.”Around 51 per cent of Gambians now have access to the internet, up from 15 per cent in 2014, according to the World Bank. This presents a big opportunity. Over the past few years, Assan says, the advent of TikTok in particular has encouraged a lot more young Gambians to become involved in comedy. “Social media is everything,” says Assan. “Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok it’s where you sell yourself.”HousewifeFor Tida Jobe, that is certainly true. Two years ago, the then-24-year-old was a housewife. Scrolling on her phone at home, she discovered TikTok – first laughing at Senegalese comedians and “white people . . . content from America”. Now, she says she is Gambia’s most-followed comedian, with nearly 142,000 fans and 4.5 million likes. On Instagram, she has 80,300 followers.She makes her living from “advertisements and contracts”, which take time to negotiate, but the videos come naturally, she says. “I will place my camera, think of something crazy and do it.” Sometimes, she posts up to six videos a day.In one of her videos, Tida imagines that she is set to be the third wife of a reluctant Adama Barrow, the incumbent president whose shock election win in 2016 was the reason Jammeh was forced to leave the country. She has also made videos about Gambian diaspora attempts to cook local food, marabouts (Muslim holy men) and an imagined conversation between Jammeh and presidential candidate Ousainou Darboe, whom supporters call Gambia’s “Mandela” because he was imprisoned during the dictatorship.Tida also emphasises that she is neutral. “I just keep it respectful. I always say when Jammeh was around he would really appreciate me.”Like many of the Gambia’s other comedians, Tida recorded a video before the election, calling on her followers to “choose peace at all times”. She says it was partially inspired by a meeting with a UN-backed organisation called Peace Hub in the lead-up to the vote, in which six Gambian “influencers” were encouraged to create this kind of content.Tida will not say who she voted for, but after the results were announced she went to a huge victory rally held for the incumbent, Barrow, who won another term with 53 per cent of the vote, compared to Darboe’s 28 per cent. “I published videos from the celebration, told the people, ‘now we have a new president, let’s come together,’” she says. “The president is the president, we cannot go against the president.”MonopolyAfter Jammeh was ousted, a government monopoly on broadcast news was broken, and the Gambia’s media industry flourished. Dozens of private radio stations were set up, as well as at least five private TV stations.One of the most popular new channels is QTV, which runs a weekly sketch comedy show by Muhammed Nyang, a Gambian comedian popularly known as Wagan. At 40, he is older than the others, and has been working for longer.The first time I am supposed to interview him is the day after the 2021 election result. Several opposition candidates, including Darboe, have refused to concede, alleging that the voting had been rigged. I am getting out of a taxi when I unexpectedly get tear-gassed. First, opposition supporters come running by. Then I spot police lined up to my left, facing off with them. Two begin to shoot tear gas, and the protesters retreat.My eyes run and I douse a surgical mask in drinking water, putting that across my mouth. Two women collapse on the ground ahead of me, with others pouring water on their faces. Some of the protesters throw stones and bottles. This is one of a smattering of demonstrations over a few days.When I first visited the Gambia, in early 2018, Jammeh had been gone for a year. At that time, many Gambians were vocal about how excited they were that they could finally express their feelings. In particular, they wanted to explain how Jammeh had made them suffer.Nearly four years later, the country remains one of the poorest in the world, ranking in the bottom 18 countries globally in last year’s UN Human Development Report. The Covid-19 pandemic has further damaged an economy where tourism made up as much as 16 per cent of the GDP and supported more than 80,000 jobs directly or indirectly, according UN figures.Many Gambians are worried about the future, blaming their country’s woes on the current administration. They are also concerned about the intentions of Barrow, who had promised to step down after three years of a transitional period, but reneged on this pledge and will now serve at least another five. “The price of cooking oil has doubled in a year,” worries one taxi driver. “Freedom of speech, we have it, but apart from that it’s not easy.”Wagan and I reschedule the interview for the following afternoon, by which stage the protests have mostly stopped. He is polite, wearing a T-shirt and suit trousers, and sitting, hunched, in an office chair.BackstoryHe explains his backstory: he ran a shop selling clothes in one of the Gambia’s biggest markets before he got involved in comedy in 2009, when he was 28. First, Wagan had a radio programme focused on “skits, but nothing political”.“Comedy back then wasn’t popular then, we had very few people who were into it,” he says. “The current generation is luckier than we are. There are so many TV stations now, so many radio stations.”Yet he too is still cautious when it comes to the fragility of the Gambia’s new democracy. He says he would be hesitant to mention the main opposition party in his upcoming show amid a wait to see whether they will challenge the election results legally (“once it becomes a court matter I can’t comment on it”).In the meantime, Wagan feels a responsibility to encourage citizens to trust in the process because “everybody knows Wagan”. He sees the power of comedians in the Gambia as on a par with journalists and musicians. “I think we all have an important role to play . . . and I think it should be a collective approach,” he says.Tunkara, who comes from London, adds that he’s been trying to get Wagan to watch Laurel and Hardy and Charlie Chaplin – “all the masters”. Wagan says he has never travelled outside the Gambia, but would like to perform abroad.At the recording of the Wagan Show on Wednesday, Wagan, his partner Haddy Nyang, and a troupe of others swap in and out playing different characters on their small set, performing in front of a screen with Wagan’s face on it. Wagan uses a brush to apply talcum powder to his eyebrows and becomes the chairman of the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), poking fun at the man’s sluggishness in announcing the election results he becomes Adama Barrow, the incumbent president, celebrating another term flanked by his two wives then he applies make-up to become the mayor of Banjul, an opposition supporter who had called on the president to concede.There is dancing, drumming, and at least once the filming has to be restarted because the cast are laughing too much. At the beginning of the show, though, Wagan reiterates his calls for peace.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warming"},{"url":null,"title":"tsunami of omicron could see 25 000 infections a day in scotland","story":"First minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon: ‘The fact is, we do face a renewed and very severe challenge in the face of the new Omicron variant.’ Photograph: Fraser BremnerDaily MailPAScotland could see a “tsunami of infections” from the new Omicron variant, first minister Nicola Sturgeon has said.A Scottish government evidence paper said the variant “threatens a rapid and large surge” in cases, with modelling showing infections could rise as high as 25,000 a day in the worst-case scenario.The rate at which cases of the new variant double is between two and three days, the paper said, and it is highly probable that Omicron will become the dominant variant within Scotland “very quickly”.The upper range of the document’s worst-case scenario projection for the Omicron variant falls just short of 25,000 cases a day by December 20th, while the most-likely range of the worst-case scenario will see cases hit a little more than 15,000.In the best-case scenario, cases will peak at just more than 1,250.Ms Sturgeon told a coronavirus briefing in Edinburgh on Friday following publication of the paper: “The fact is, we do face a renewed and very severe challenge in the face of the new Omicron variant.“To be blunt, because of the much greater and faster transmissibility of this new variant, we may be facing – indeed we may be starting to experience – a potential tsunami of infections.”More than 1,000 confirmed, probable and possible Omicron cases have been reported in Scotland. So far six cases of Omicron have been identified in the Republic.The data has shown it is “likely that a proportion of these infections will result in hospitalisation”, the paper said.But it added: “Even if the resulting illness is relatively mild, the number of cases could potentially cause great disruption to other services, in the economy and businesses, and in wider society, as more people would be absent from work due to illness and asked to isolate if they test positive or as contacts of someone who has tested positive.“It also means that the rapid rise in Omicron infections could put significant additional pressure on hospitals and other health and care services, close to the point in the winter when they are already likely to be at peak pressure.” – PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"beverly knight tells rat a d theatregoers stay away disrupt","story":" Beverley Knight, the West End actress, has told “rat-a---d” theatregoers to stay home.The singer-turned-stage-performer from Wolverhampton criticised members of the audience at the Garrick Theatre, after a second performance of the musical she is starring in was disrupted.After Thursday evening’s rendition of The Drifters Girl, Knight took to Twitter to complain about the show-stopping disruption.“Ok. If your intention is to come to the theatre, get rat-a---d, make a scene, disrupt the show thus causing a show-stop?“My advice is stay at home. People pay to come to the theatre to be entertained, not to endure your foolishness. Done.”Members of the audience that night responded to Knight’s tweets, with one saying: “We were there last night and this person’s behaviour was shocking!”Another person tweeted: “People were drinking throughout, so by the second half they were joining in with the singing and drowning the cast out.“There was a lot of lurching in the interval. Perhaps limit the amount of drinks sold and not allow people to bring bottles in from outside?”Ms Knight said that suggestions for theatres to limit or stop selling alcohol were “tricky” because they “rely on the revenue that the bar receives”.She added: “Most folk who come along are not utter idiots.”A spokesperson for the production said that two audience members had to be escorted out of the building by theatre staff for “loud and abusive behaviour” during Thursday’s performance.They continued: “The cast left the stage whilst this happened, before resuming and completing the performance.“This is an isolated incident, however both The Drifters Girl and Nimax Theatres would ask all patrons to behave in a responsible, respectful manner when attending a performance.”The Drifters Girl has been playing in the Garrick Theatre, in London’s West End, since November 4 and is running until July next year.Tickets to see Knight, known as the queen of British soul, are selling for upwards of £20.The musical is about the “formidable businesswoman” Faye Treadwell, played by Knight, and her management of the long-lived R\u0026ampB and soul vocal group The Drifters.The ’s review said: “The sound of the show, I should declare, is exquisite, Beverley Knight leading the way and raising the roof at points in the title role.”Hundreds of people responded to Ms Knight’s Twitter post about the show’s disruption on Thursday, many sharing similar stories of raucous behaviour at other West End theatre performances.Melissa Phillips, an actress known for Gangs of London, tweeted in response that the “same scenario” happened at another West End show she attended recently.She said: “The person had to be removed by 6 security staff. The show stopped temporarily. It was distressing!”Another added: “I went to the show and wasn’t too far from the person that disrupted the show which she should be ashamed of.“I didn’t think the audience drowned out the cast at all some people sang along and was just enjoying the brilliant show.”Problems with audience behaviour in theatres is not uncommon as the use of mobile phones, loud chatting and eating can all become distracting and disruptive to other theatregoers.However, “rat-arsed” audience members can pose a safety threat and be disorderly to the point of causing a “show-stop”, as Ms Knight experienced on Thursday.More from NewsThere’s a new threat to Christmas: elf and safetyGhislaine Maxwell trial: 11 key moments in the prosecution caseRussia and China trying to erode our liberties, Liz Truss to warn G7Care homes limit visitors to three over omicron fearsSaturday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Michael Gove hints at tougher Covid restrictions amid ‘deeply concerning’ omicron spreadMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cambridges sending harry meghan barbed christmas message","story":"Glad tidings of comfort and joy this week as William and Kate returned to Westminster Abbey to record a carol service to be broadcast on ITV on Christmas Eve. The Abbey was, of course, the scene of the last major public meeting between the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Meghan and Harry (a Commonwealth Day service in March 2020) before relations went spectacularly awry.So there were amused smiles in the congregation when they opened the service sheet to find the Cambridges’ little nod to the royal twosome in California: the Sussex Carol. It was sung just after the Duke of Cambridge had read, from St Luke’s Gospel, that “there was no room for them in the inn”. Oh dear.Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, owned up to his part in Matt Hancock’s downfall this week. He told a live recording of Matt Forde’s Political Party podcast that the fateful CCTV camera was put up in the Secretary of State’s room when he oversaw an office move.“I honestly didn’t have any idea where it was pointed but for Matt it was very, very bad luck,” Hunt said, adding: “If it was someone trying to catch him out doing some mischief that camera would have been pointed at the sofa, not the door.”Hunt also lifted the lid on his embarrassment when, during his time as foreign secretary, he said, during a visit to Beijing, that his Chinese wife Lucia was Japanese. He desperately tried to phone her to warn her of the gaffe. When he eventually got through, Lucia answered in her best Japanese: “Konnichiwa – darling!”Lily Cole has been handing out the kind of eco-advice that only a supermodel worth £10 million can offer: suggesting people should reuse their couture gowns. “I wore my old McQueen dress for the Fashion Awards, because sustainability means loving things MORE and committing to them!” she reveals.What’s wrong with going to Oxfam?More on why honours for prime ministers appear to have stopped with Tony Blair. I disclosed last week that the current situation means Theresa May is styling herself Lady May after her husband Philip was knighted. Friends of the former Labour PM have since confirmed that Blair “hasn’t been offered one”.Privy Council expert David Rogers tells me former prime ministers are sniffy about peerages because they tend – with some notable exceptions like Margaret Thatcher and Harold Wilson – to be given to politicians who lose elections. This would explain why William Hague, Michael Howard and Neil Kinnock are in the Lords along with David Owen and David Steel. “Heath, Major, Blair, Brown considered themselves far too successful to go to the Lords and mix with failures,” Rogers says.Great excitement about Harry Hill’s upcoming musical Tony! – a “rock opera” about “the life of former Ugly Rumours front man and Britain’s first pop prime minister”. Hill and his co-writer Steve Brown have been putting on “work in progress” previews of the show. ITV political editor Robert Peston – who was recently spotted having lunch with Hill at The Wolseley restaurant in Piccadilly, London – has been lucky enough to see it, and says it is indeed “very funny”.Peston has also just published his own novel. “Fingers crossed The Whistleblower will be a TV series,” he tells me. “The musical can wait.”Paddy Renouf – who lived for free at the Savoy hotel as its resident “London expert” – has been sharing tips from his time as a tour guide to the stars, when he would carry out all manner of odd requests for high-paying guests.They’re lucky he wasn’t in charge of room service if his tips for a good sirloin are anything to go by. “I buy a simple supermarket steak, cover it in black pepper and leave it in the fridge for a week to give mould a chance to grow,” he says. “Then do it for two minutes on each side in a hot pan and it’s restaurant standard.” I wouldn’t try that at home.Spotted at the press night for Life of Pi at London’s Wyndham Theatre: the author of the best-selling book that spawned the play, Yann Martel, who confessed he had seen it “five or six times” because he loved it so much.

Which can only mean the other third have not been paying attention. Just to bring you up to speed, in case you fall into that category: the Prime Minister knew absolutely nothing about a Christmas party that definitely didn’t happen in Downing Street on December 18 last year.“How could it have happened when Christmas parties weren’t allowed due to Covid?” I hear you cry. Well, quite, that is precisely why it didn’t. Just as Owen Patterson did not commit any breaches of lobbying rules and just as Bill Clinton did not have sexual relations with that woman. Nothing whatsoever to see here. Just a nice baby girl, born to Johnson’s wife Carrie this week. Can’t we just focus on that?But here’s the curious part: although this party didn’t take place, Allegra Stratton, Johnson’s former press secretary, was filmed laughing about it anyway in a video that was leaked to ITV News. Which was somewhat unfortunate for all those who had insisted it never took place. Obviously Stratton had to resign from her current job, for laughing about a party that didn’t happen. The country, meanwhile, has kept itself busy sharing jokes and memes about what has inevitably now been called Christmas partygate. One wag on Twitter suggested Labour refer to the Tories from here on in as simply “The Christmas Party.” Another said of Johnson’s apparent non-attendance at the party that didn’t take place:Yes, it has been a rich seam to mine, and if we didn’t laugh we’d be crying as we asked ourselves in disbelief how a man who seemed so trustworthy at the outset, so clearly guided by a strict moral code, could have let us down so badly. I’m talking about Dominic Cummings, by the way, who has been sticking the knife in with contributions like this one below, which doesn’t seem in the Christmas spirit at all, since he seems to be implying these non-existent parties actually happened:The public has drawn its own conclusions on the matter. They firmly believe Johnson, as should we all:Some even expressed their support by comparing him to their favourite television comedians, such as Kathy Burke...But if, despite all the copper-bottomed assurances that no party or parties took place and no rules were broken, at least we know the very best officers have been assigned to the case.

In the following year, all three received an indefinite leave to remain, and a year after this, they received their British Citizenship. With this, I also automatically gained citizenship through my parents - and of course, I was born here - so for all intents and purposes, I was and am British. Growing up in North London, I went to school in Barnet and then went on to secondary school nearby as well. Ultimately, I graduated from University of London while working multiple jobs throughout my university years. I then started my career as a journalist and hoped to make a change because the industry lacked British south Asians, and coverage around the community has been predominantly negative. There are around six million people like me, with similar stories of being born and brought up here, working in the UK and classing themselves as British Pakistani - which, despite having Pakistani at the end of it, does not make the aposBritishapos part of it any less credible - surely  Although at times it feels as though we are unwanted, this country is where we entered the world and is what we know. Evenwe decide to visit our home countries to gain more of a connection with our cultures, at the end of the day we are British citizens, right  But as much as we try to cling on to being British Pakistani or British Bangladeshi, British anything, the second part of the title has become a tool to ensure we know that we are in fact second-class citizens. This is because even though I was born here, I can be deprived of my citizenshipI am able to become a national of another country - for me, I could be deported to Pakistan on the governmentaposs whim. Despite being born and brought up here, clause , proposed by Priti Patel in July and updated last month, would allow for the Home Office to deprive me of my citizenship without delivering physical notication.This means,I went abroad and the government was unable to contact me, before boarding a plane back I could be told my passport is no longer valid without any warning.Mohammed Tasnime Akunjee, the lawyer known for representing Shamima Begum, explained how the new clause impacts Brits like me. He said: The existing law is thatthe Home Secretary deems you not conducive to the public good, and wish to strip you of citizenship, they have to sent you a notice of their decision with a reason for why they are stripping you of citizenship. However, now with the new clause, they donapost have to tell you, youaposll only be told when you try board a plane and your passport is no longer al. The government has said those who are deprived of their citizenship without notice have the right to appeal, but Mr Akunjee says there are issues with this.  He said: You need a physical notice in order to appeal a decision -you donapost have that then the courts will demand that you prove that you have actually have been stripped. You have to acquire that proof and be able to submit that to the court before you can even appeal. Additionally, although some might think that being born here would put you less at risk of being deprived of your status, Mr Akunjee says from a legal perspective, it does not. He said: Both peoplecan be stripped of their citizenship, being born or not born here doesnapost make a dference in respect of this bill. According to , the Home Office has said: “British citizenship is a privilege, not a right. Deprivation of citizenship on conducive grounds is rightly reserved for those who pose a threat to the UK or whose conduct involves very high harm. The Nationality and Borders Bill will amend the law so citizenship can be deprived where it is not practicable to give notice, for example,there is no way of communicating with the person.” So this means that as long as I am a good immigrant, I can stay in the UK  ButI was white, as I would be less likely to be able to get another nationality I would be more likely to keep my British citizenship regardless of what threat I pose to the public. *A version of this piece originally appeared on MyLondon Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Priti PatelHome OfficePoliticsShamima Begum\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Allies of Mrs Johnson - then Ms Symonds - denied the reports at the time. And asked whether the party took place at PMQs on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said: No.Yesterday, it was confirmed that as well as investigating the party held in Number  on December , a second gathering on Novmeber  would also be subject to a probe by Cabinet Secretary Simon Case. Tory Minister Michael Ellis told MPs that the investigation will establish the facts around events alleged to have taken place in Downing Street on November  and December .

I believe this newspaper made a signal contribution with our exposure of the Covid rule-breaking in Downing Street.The story of illicit Christmas parties among Tory aides last winter wasn’t just a journalistic scoop. It lanced the boil of deceit in high places.And it acted as a lightning rod for all the frustration and rage of people who have endured so much and feel let down by the government’s incompetence, duplicity and delay during  months of coronavirus crisis.When “Partygate” was made public, people who had lost loved ones reacted with understandable anger. Their wrath against “one rule for them, another for us” boiled over across the media. It all came out. We have seen a similar upsurge of voter disgust before. It swept John Major’s sleaze-ridden government out of office in . But this time it’s personal, directed against an inidual Prime Minister who they know is the chief architect of this scandalous state of affairs. The people’s fury has forced arrogant Boris Johnson out of his lethal lethargy. He was compelled to invoke Plan B-lite restrictions, against his own inclination and in defiance of his hard-line MPs.And he had no option but to set up an inquiry into the shenanigans in his own office. The investigation by Cabinet Secretary Sir Simon Case must not be another Whitehall whitewash. If the rule-breakers are not brought to book, public distrust with government will increase.  The politan police should also be jolted out of their supine indference to the antics of the Tory Bright Young Things who think the law is for “the little people” – like you and me. The video of these highly paid jacks-in-office laughing and joking about their Downing Street party tipped this story over the edge into public outrage.But none of this would have happened without the Daily Mirror’s disclosures ten days ago, which were repeatedly denied by the Number  lie machine.And still are refuted – by the very aides who partied way into the night while everyone  was compelled by law not to mix with their own family. Vomit-inducing. The time has come for someone – preferably Sir Keir Starmer – to stand up in Parliament and repeat the words of Oliver Cromwell to the Long Parliament in , and Tory MP Leo Amery to appeasement premier Neville Chamberlain in : “You have sat here too long for any good you are doing - in the name of God, go!” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative Partypolitan PolicePlan BBoris JohnsonPoliticsCoronavirusDowning Street Christmas Party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The FM said the Scottish Government was acting as Omicron was set to overtake Delta as the most dominant strain within days, adding Covid could put signicant additional pressure on hospitals and other health and care services at the peak pressure of winter. “The fact is, we do face a renewed and very severe challenge in the face of of the new Omicron iant,” she said at a briefing in Edinburgh. “To be blunt, because of the much greater and faster transmissibility of this new iant, we may be facing – indeed we may be starting to experience – a potential tsunami of infections.” Meanwhile in Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford also sounded the alarm over the new Covid strain, telling reporters at a briefing that restrictions would be reviewed weekly. The Department for Health said on Thursday there had been , new Covid infections and fears for the NHS are growing.The Prime Minister announced on Wednesday that England would move to Plan B restrictions, with people told to work from home as of Monday. The ramping up of Covid curbs also means more mandated mask-wearing and next week MPs will vote on a Covid pass scheme for some venues. But the Prime Ministeraposs authority has been damaged over the lockdown-breaking Christmas bash in No last December - first revealed by the Mirror. On Thursday night it emerged his communications director Jack Doyle gave a thank-you speech at the event and handed staff spoof awards.Tory backbenchers are also threatening a major rebellion over the Covid pass plan while Labour has said the PM is not fit to lead the country as the pandemic rages.Askedpeople in England should cancel their Christmas parties too, Mr Johnsonaposs spokesman said on Friday: Under Plan B, weaposre not shutting hospitality. The use of certication enables a number of venues to remain open when otherwise we would have had to close them for public health reasons as we have had to do previously. We understand fully the impact that these measures have had on hospitality in the past and certication allows them to remain trading.

The UK recorded its highest number of Covid infections since January  today and UK scientists warned millions could catch the new strain before the New Year as it will become the dominant iant in the UK by mid-December. The Survation poll for the Mirror reveals % of people are less likely to follow Covid rulesGovernment officials have broken them. The survey of , Brits online found % believe Government officials did break the rules at the peak of the second wave, with % stating the incidents should be investigated by the police.And % of Conservative voters who backed Boris Johnson in the last General Election believe the Tories think itaposs one rule for them and another for everyone . The poll comes after Professor Chris Whitty said he fears Brits will not accept new lockdown restrictions after enduring almost two years of the pandemic. Speaking to a  at the Local Government Association he added: “My greatest worry at the moment is that people…we need to do something more muscular at some point, whether it’s for the current new iant or at some later stage, can we still take people with us ” The Office for National Statisticsinfection survey found  in  people had Covid in England, in the week ending December . This equates to around , people. On Friday face masks were made mandatory in most indoor spaces including cinemas, theatres, churches and galleries.And from Monday those who can work from home are advised to do so, and on Wednesday the NHS Covid Passwill become mandatory for entry into nightclubs and other large gatherings.The PM’s spokesman slapped down rumours of a Covid ‘Plan C’ or a ‘Plan B plus’ being prepared for the New Year just in case the plan B measures did not curb the new iant. Plan B measures are set to be introduced next week, with MPs set to vote on the measures in the Commons on Tuesday. But at least  Tory MPs are set to rebel and vote against the introduction of tighter Covid restrictions, with many furious with Mr Johnson’s handling of Downing Street party revelations.  Former Tory chief whip Mark Harper said the PMaposs authority has been diminished by the Owen Paterson sleaze row and the alleged Downing Street party. He told the Commons on Wednesday: “Why should people listen to the Prime Minister’s instructions to follow the rules when people inside Number  Downing Street don’t do so ”And renowned rebel Steve Baker told the Mirror he hoped Labour would vote against the measures.But shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting slammed rumours of Labour voting against plan B restrictions in order to defeat the PM.He told BBC ’s Radio  Today programme “public health has always come first for the Labour Party during the pandemic. Despite the trouble the Government finds themselves in, public health will still come before party politics”. Sir Keir Starmer said the booster programme should have been ramped up weeks ago. “The Government pooh-poohed that it’s now doing it but again, as ever, too late, he added.The Survation study put Labour on a six-point lead over the Conservatives, which suggests voters have lost faith in Mr Johnsonaposs handling of the pandemic following the party scandal. Since the Mirror first revealed parties were held at the Prime Ministeraposs Number  flat in the run up to Christmas last year, the PM is now facing accusations of seven separate parties and drinks doaposs held across Westminster in November and December last year. Cabinet Secretary Simon Case is currently investigating three dates on which bashes were said to have been held in breach of lockdown rules. They are, a No leaving do on November  at which the PM spoke a No Christmas party on December  and a Department for Education bash on December . Downing Street has cancelled its Christmas party this year blaming the increase in workload for the cancelled plans. The Prime Ministeraposs spokesman said: I think weaposve made it clear since the latest situation with Omicron, obviously thataposs taking up a great deal of time at the moment. He added: Thereaposs no plans for [a party] in Number .On November , sources told the Mirror people gathered for drinks in Boris and Carrie Johnsonaposs flat above  Downing Street. And on the same day, farewell drinks were held in number s round table room - the night Dominic Cummings quit. Two weeks later on November , sources claim  to  people crammed into a room at Number  to say goodbye to top aide Cleo Watson, an ally of Cummings. Former Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has admitted to holding a canapes reception for his top team on December . Four days later people working on the London mayoral campaign for candidate Shaun Bailey held their own ‘raucous’ party. And on December  the Mirror broke the story about the Number  Christmas Party. ITV News reported on Thursday that Jack Doyle, who was then deputy director of communications at No , addressed up to  people at a Christmas gathering said to have been held on December .He offered to resign but the PM turned it down. A Number  spokesperson said Ed Oldfield is still in his position and the PM is still confident with his position, despite accepting Allegra Stratton’s resignation.

He predicted that the figure could be reached “sometime in January”the iant is resistant to existing protection and it has a similar severity to Delta - which is not yet known.  “Even the best-case scenarios involve several-fold more admissions per day than we’re getting at the moment – we are at about  right now,” he added. It comes as scientists say that Omicron could become the dominant iant by as soon as next week. And the government is currently looking at putting in stricter restrictions, it is reported. Daily Covid- cases have now reached their highest level in almost a year and the UKHSA predicted that,current trends continue, the UK will exceed one million infections by the end of the month. The UKHSA has also found that the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines provided “much lower” levels of protection against symptomatic infection with Omicron compared to Delta.Cabinet minister Michael Gove warned of a “deeply concerning situation” after holding a Cobra meeting on Friday afternoon to discuss the latest data and the co-ordinated response across the four nations.The government said there had been a further , lab-confirmed Covid- cases in the UK and the last time a higher daily figure was reported was on January , when , cases were recorded. An additional  confirmed cases of the Omicron iant have been reported across the UK, bringing the total number to ,. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the UKHSA, said early data indicates that “a few months after the second jab, there is a greater risk of catching the Omicron iant compared to Delta strain”. She added: “The data suggest this risk is signicantly reduced following a booster vaccine, so I urge everyone to take up their booster when eligible.” Gove said the Omicron iant is doubling every two to three days in England “and possibly even faster in Scotland”. He added that % of reported cases in London are the new iant, and warned that evidence suggests Omicron is “more likely” than past Covid iants to “potentially” lead to hospital admissions among the fully vaccinated.  Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned of the possibility of a “tsunami of infections” from the new iant – and said she could not rule out more restrictions north of the border as a result.But so far Boris Johnson has “no plans” to go further with measures in England, amid claims that he is considering a Plan C with tougher restrictions.Now under Plan B, people are required to wear masks in more indoor spaces including museums, galleries and community centres. There will be ato working from home guidance from Monday, and mandatory Covid passports for large venues from Wednesday.The new regulations will be put to a debate and vote in the Commons next week – and with Labour ’s support they are certain to be approved despite the prospect of a large Conservative revolt.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSOmicron iantCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Here we take a look at so-called Plan C and what it means Image: Evening Standard   eyevineByLizzy BuchanDeputy Online Political Editor:,  Dec | comments Tougher restrictions are being brought to tackle the spread of the Omicron iant as Boris Johnson implemented his Covid Plan B.The Prime Minister said on Wednesday that people in England should work from home where possible from December , while masks will be mandated in most public indoor venues from Friday. Vaccines passports will also be required for nightclubs and large events from December .But some experts have questioned whether the toolkit of measures will be enough to curb the new strain, with reports of officials drawing up Plan C with even tougher rules. Downing Street said on Friday there was growing confidence that the new iant spreads more quickly than Delta and there was some evidence of vaccine escape.Scotlandaposs First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned of a possible tsunami of infections ahead of a four-nations Cobra emergency meeting chaired by Cabinet Minister Michael Gove on Friday afternoon. Here we sort the fact from the fiction on future Covid restrictions in England. What is Plan C  Officially, there is no Plan C. The Governmentaposs Covid Winter Plan, published in September, includes a section on Plan B which has a string of measures to imposethe Covid situation worsens. Boris Johnson pulled the trigger on Plan B on Wednesday, with masks becoming mandatory for most indoor public spaces from Friday, and vaccine passports made a legal requirement for nightclubs and large events like football matches from Wednesday. Brits will be ordered to work from home againthey can from Monday. This was thought to be enough to keep the virus at bay over the winter, along with the mass booster programme. But the arrival of Omicron has changed things. Downing Street say there is no official Plan C amid reports officials are drawing up a contingency blueprint with more restrictions. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said on Friday there were no plans to go beyond what weaposve set out already when askedthere was going to be a published Plan C. But he added: Obviously we need to keep the characteristics of this iant under review, and we would actnecessary, but thereaposs no plans to go beyond what we set out. Askedthere was a Plan C document, he said: Not that Iaposm aware of. As a responsible Government, of course, you would expect us to... we have an array, already, of options available to us in terms of what measures we can take to mitigate a growth of any iant or virus. But there are no plans to go beyond that currently. What restrictions could be included in Plan C  There are plenty of restrictions that could come in to get infection rates down. Working from home is one of the big levers the Government can pull - and this is already coming into force next week. The other big one is a reduction on household mixing, which was mooted as a contingency plan back in October. However this would be highly unpopular and it doesnapost seem to be on the cards so far. Here are some of the ideas that could be in the pipeline. Hospitality check-ins Punters could be asked to use the NHS Covid app to check into pubs and restaurants, to help contact tracers track the spread of the disease. This rule was in place earlier this year as hospitality venues reopened after lockdown but it was later abandoned. Use of the app fell after the so-called pingdemic when hundreds of thousands of people were told to isolate, leading to staff shortages across a number of industries. In August the rules were changed so double vaccinated people no longer had to isolatepinged by the app. Instead they were advised to take a PCR testthey came into contact with an infected person.  Face masks in all indoor spaces Rules on face coverings have been tightened since Friday, to cover indoor spaces such as theatres and cinemas as well as shops and public transport. But officials are said to be considering making it mandatory in all indoor spaces, which would include hospitality too. Vaccine passports in more venues From December , people will have to prove they are double jabbed or have had a negative Covid test to go to nightclubs and large events like football matches. But this could be broadened to smaller venues too. The Government has been reluctant to require vaccine passports for pubs and other hospitality venues but this could be considered.  Tougher isolation rules Self isolation rules were loosened in the summer so double vaccinated people didnapost have to stay at home for  daysthey came into contact with an infected person. Following the emergence of Omicron, the rules were tweaked so anyone who is a contact of an Omicron case has to isolate regardless of vaccination status. Bringing back the -day rule could have an impact - but it would be controversial again. What would cause Plan C to be triggered  The Government usually refuses to say explicitly what thresholds need to be met to lead to new restrictions - as the situation can change rapidly. But we can take some educated guesses based on the Winter Plan and previous lockdown rules.Throughout the pandemic, one of the key aims of restrictions is to prevent the NHS coming under unsustainable pressure. Hospitalisation rates are a key thing to watch for as large numbers of people being admitted onto Covid wards would put the health service under strain. How well vaccines are working is another critical factor, as the protection offered by the jab has allowed everyone toto some semblance of ordinary le. One of the big unknowns about the Omicron iant is how well the existing vaccines work against it. This is what scientists are currently trying to find out. The transmissibility of the new iant is also important - and how sick people are becoming from it. The new iant may seem frightening but it is worth remembering that we didnapost have the vaccine last winter, which is the best protection against the virus. When could that happen  The short answer is we donapost know. Experts are still working to understand the new iant and the scientic advice will be critical to whatever decisions the Government makes. There are some indications that the new iant may cause less serious illness than feared - but this could still have a big impact on the NHSit spread quickly and infects lots of people. There is also the political angle, as lots of Tory MPs are unhappy with the idea of further restrictions - so there could be some big parliamentary battlesthe Prime Minister tries to bring in fresh curbs. MPs will vote on Tuesday on the Plan B measures, which would be reviewed again in the New Year. However the Government can bring in additional restrictions soonerthe public health case is strong enough.

Shes since been offered morphine and Tramadol to cope with the pain - but was desperate for a permanent solutionChrissie first asked her GP about sterilisation when she was just  years old Image: Make The HeadlinesByTfany WallisJessica TaylorReal Le Features Writer:,  Dec | commentsA single mum-of-two who suffered excruciating pain during her period has taken the drastic step of being sterilised - at just  years old. Chrissie Hadfield first started suffering from painful periods and ovulation pain when she was  years old, after the birth of her oldest child. Each time her period came, she describes feeling a pain like a hot blade in her abdomen, leaving her doubled over in pain and unable to stand. She would also develop thrush each month and had poly-cystic oies - one of which was inflamed. After two dficult pregnancies with her  and eight-year-old children, she decided she wasnapost going to have any more kids. And when her youngest was born, she ended up in hospital with ovulation pain. She was given morphine to manage it, but doctors couldnapost figure out what was wrong with her.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here She said: “Over the next  years, doctors put me on every form of contraception you can think of. “They thought the contraception would help control the bleeding and help control the pain but none of them did. Anything hormonal literally wiped me out. She added that her period pain was so bad, she was once given drugs only given to women in labour. Eventually, she had a non-hormonal coilfitted, but this made her periods irregular and meant she could be bleeding for  days out of the month. I could also feel myself ovulating. It felt like a metal ball on fire rolling down my abdomen and every now and again it would shoot spikes. It was extremely painful.  When she reached  years old, Chrissie decided enough was enough and, knowing she didnapost want to have any more children, she asked her GP about sterilisation. But she claims her request was met with dficulty and was told it would be tricky for a single woman of her age to have the operation. “I had to show that every form of contraception does not work for my body, the hormonal contraceptives give me mental health problems and my body rejects the non-hormonal coil, she said. “I had to keep the copper coil, so I was on some form of contraception, but I was developing bacterial vaginosis and thrush every time I had a period, so I was given antibiotics every month.” Chrissie was also worried about the long-term damage taking so much medication each month would have on her body. She explained: “Being on this much medication is unnatural. Each cycle, I was developing cysts on my oies and tubes and a scan showed I had a right inflamed oy. “So, the thought of having sterilisation to me was a dream and a way out from all the medication and no more contraception. Hopefully an end to my pain.” The dficulty she experienced with her GP was repeated when she told people she wanted to be sterilised.In a Facebook post, she wrote: Back in February I expressed that I had been put on a list to be permanently sterilised. Not just because I didnapost want more children, it was mainly for health reasons.But I expressed how other peopleaposs opinions were the reason I was keeping it quiet because everyone was so vocal about their own concerns. She added: “I haven’t given into this decision lightly, so negative comments about my age or situation haven’t helped. I know sterilisation is final, I know how old I am, and I know I have made the right choice. “I have made this decision for myself. It seems to be natural for a man to have the snip, but a woman taking ownership of her own body is frowned upon.  Even to the point I was told yesterday by another woman during my pre op assessment... you know your partner could get the snip instead  I’ve had men not even knowing what a fallopian tube is and women telling me Iaposm making a mistake because ‘whatI meet a man who wants kidsapos  Responding to these comments, Chrissie says people arenapost conscious of what she wants and needs, given that sheaposs suffered excruciatingly painful periods for  years. People just hear sterilisation and jump straight away to judgement. Especially as I was single when I started this journey, she wrote. But finally, last month, she had the operation to remove her right fallopian tube and part of her left. “Does it make me less desirable because I canapost bear children  Does it make me less than a woman  Will it make me seen as a short term partner instead of a long term partner  “What will people think  Will people pity me because of my situation  Will I regret it  But you know what, I feel relieved, and I feel empowered. “Finally, a step to try and ease the pain I have been experiencing for years. All that worry was about what other people thought again. But I have a boyfriend who is amazing, she wrote. She encouraged people not to judge what others do with their own bodies - and remember that thereaposs a lot we donapost know about what others are going through.Do you have a real le story to share  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcNow in recovery, Chrissieaposs pain hasnapost fully gone away, but itaposs more manageable. Now, she wants to promote equality around fertility issues. She said: “We are approaching . These should not still be issues women are facing to take control of their own bodies. “Nearly every woman has quoted to me, ‘my body my choice’ and I feel empathy for all the women who have thanked me for speaking up about my own experience, as it has given them confidence to speak up about their own. “Being sterilised shouldn’t make me any less of a woman,anything it gives me the ability to be more human.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSHospitalsPeriodsFertility\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The organisation said while it is yet to find any credible evidence of extraterrestrial le, it is not closed to the possibility that aliens exist. It comes from a Nasa report released in November under a Freedom of Information request from GovernmentAttic.org. In a collection of emails, one Nasa official said the earliest alien records are probably ,BC or  AD, or not depending on what science and comments we believe. This was written in relation to the unsolved mystery of a cooking pot in China which dates back to ,BCIts owner asked Nasa for an expert opinion on the potapossUFO artwork depicting symbolic language, hidden meanings, futuristic spaceships and clothes from a vanished civilisation.The official responded: YesI was an alien who visited earth say , years ago or anytime, I too would take a simple thing in front of me like a clay pot to record my visit in multiple aposlanguagesapos or symbols and dimensions and technologies... including D, D, D, D, D, and beyond any comprehension here now.  However, he concluded that the potaposs drawing which defies the laws of physics, showing and aircraft with no motors, wings or tails, must be a unique coincidence. The document also addressed reports of unidentied aerial phenomenon, more commonly known as UFOs. It stated: “When we learn of unidentied aerial phenomena, it opens up the door to new science questions to explore. The language of scientists is data. But without access to full data, it is nearly impossible to very or explain any observation. It went on to highlight that scientic study of UFOs is facing a central problem being the lack of robust data including the lack of access to information that already exists. The revelation comes after a Pentagon report in June revealed what the US government knows about a series of mysterious flying objects that have been observed in military airspaces in recent decades. It looked at  records of sightings of what the government described as an unidentied aerial phenomenon or UFO.  Investigators were able to explain only one of those encounters which was attributed to airborne clutter. There was no evidence which pointed towards aliens or a major technological advancement by a foreign territory, such as China or Russia, as a viable explanation for the sightings. A senior US official said: Of the  reports we are dealing with here, we have no clear indications that there is any non-terrestrial explanation for them, but we will go wherever the data takes us. We don’t have any clear indications that any of these unidentied aerial phenomena are part of a foreign collection programme and we don’t have any clear data that is indicative of a major technological advancement by a potential adversary. Signicant efforts continue to track such developments and officials continue to watch that very carefully they added. Another senior official said that  of the reports show UFOs “that appear to have some sort of advanced propulsion or advanced technology. They also indicated speeds beyond what the US considers to be possible in the realms of foreign adversaries despite having a lack of propulsion or acceleration.

Leo is  of  in the world to be diagnosed with a TBCD gene mutation that affects his brain, central nervous system and muscles. Leo spent nearly four months in the ICU at St. Thomasapos hospital in Lambeth, before being discharged as doctors didn’t know anything more they could do to save him.  Lucinda, who now lives in Chatham in Kent, said: “It was completely unforeseen. When he was born, I was in complete shock. The severity of it didnapost really sink in. I donapost think it really did until I saw him in the incubator with all the tubes and wires. I just burst out crying. “Nothing that could be done because of the rarity of the condition. Even specialists out there that havenapost even heard of this disorder. “Then he was discharged. I was told to enjoy the time that I have with him. Leo requires round the clock care as he suffers with has epileptic seizures and low muscle tone, which means he has dficulty moving and breathing.  Overnight he requires ventilation, which kicks in when he stops breathing when is in a a deep sleep. Lucinda previously worked in hospitality while working abroad in Canada, but came back to the UK have Leo and now is a full-time Mum to him. Despite doctors presenting the option to turn Leoaposs le support machine off in the beginning, Lucinda chose to fight for Leo. While she praised doctors who did their best for him, Lucinda says she “just couldn’t accept that there was nothing that could be done for her son. “I have sent thousands upon thousands of posts and emails all over the world to try and find someone who knew more and could help.” she said. “It’s a deteriorating condition - he will get progressively worse. It could get to the point where he’s too weak to breathe. But I want to get help before his health declines. He is definitely defying the odds right now - I hope he continues to.  “I’ve helped him with physio somewhat - I can get him as strong as physically possible, but without medical help, thereaposs only so much I can do. Due to the rarity of Leo’s conditions, there are very few medical experts on the condition. This also means she is left in limbo, with no one being able to say for sure how long Leo has left. But, despite having no medical background, Lucinda says her fight for Leo engulfed her in research in a bid to do anything that will help him. She said: “I had no medical background before this, but you do become an expert in your child. I have sat down for hours and looked at medical results. I would google each word I didnapost understand and try and put it together in a simplied form to understand what it actually means. I would research how a specic diet might help him, or supplements to make him stronger.  “But I get days when I just feel like Iaposm losing the fight for him. Iaposll pick him up from his cot and hug him and cry. But I use that for my motivation to keep going. I put all that negative stuff to the back of my mind.Lucinda has found some hope in a US biotech company who can research ‘drug re-purposing’ for Leo - whereby drugs to treat other conditions might have unintended benefits. They can also undertake revolutionary treatment to change Leoaposs failing gene to produce the protein that he is lacking. But the treatment costs £, - so she relying on fundraising.  He is my motivation to keep going, Lucinda added. Lucinda has also managed to connect with some of the other parents whose children have the same condition - of which there are only  in the world. She said: They are mostly in the States but thereaposs one in Peru, a couple in Turkey. One mum in particular I became very good friends with and we bounce ideas off each other.

With Christmas parties in full swing, people may want to knowthey can drink before they are given the jabCoronavirus vaccines can cause minor side effects and drinking booze may not help Image: Barcroft Media via Getty ImagesByBenjamin LynchSEO writer:,  Dec | commentsVaccines are vitally important for tackling the coronavirus pandemic. The government hopes that despite new restrictions such as Plan B, as well as further restrictions possible in the form of aposPlan C apos, hospital admissions will be lower due to vaccinations.When the UK was forced to lockdown in  and early , most of the population was unvaccinated against the virus. Receiving the vaccine should not be too much of an inconvenience unless you are someone who may have a reaction to it. Some people have experienced brief, flu-like symptoms after receiving it, but most are expected to be fighting fit and are welcome to socialise after being vaccinated. So can you drink alcohol before and after your vaccine  Can I drink alcohol before or after having the Covid- vaccine   It is probably best to avoid drinking before and after the vaccine and you are only damaging yourselfyou have been drinking excessively. Alcohol may harm your immune response triggered by the vaccine by suppressing your immune system. If your immune system is slower to react, then the effectiveness of the vaccine could be impacted.  As for drinking after receiving the vaccine, people have been known to have side effects caused by the jab. Alcohol will not help any of these symptoms and is not a cure for feeling ill, it is just likely to dehydrate you and you will feel worse. Can alcohol affect the immune system   When a person is exposed to a virus, the bodyaposs antibodies are tasked with fighting off this illness. Healthier people with better and faster immune systems can fight viruses off more quickly. This is why older people are more at risk from viruses like Covid-, as their immune response is typically slower. Yale Medicine addiction medicine specialist Dr. E. Jenner Edelman, told Healthline: Alcohol has erse adverse effects throughout the body, including on all cells of the immune system, that lead to increased risk of serious infections.With COVID-, alcohol is likely to interfere with an inidual’s ability to clear SARS-CoV- and cause people to suffer worse outcomes. What are the side effects of the coronavirus vaccine   In February, around one in three people reported some kind of side effect from the vaccine, including some soreness around the area the needle penetrated the skin. Side effects are caused by the bodyaposs response to the vaccine and not the virus itself.Dr Anna Goodman of Guyaposs and St Thomasapos Hospital, in London, told the BBC that a heavier response to the vaccine does not mean you are more immune to the virus than others.

William and Kate released the photo on Friday afternoon with their three children and Charlotte quickly went viral as people saw the similarity to the Queen, even in the way she posed.The six-year-old was sat beside her father Prince William while her two brothers, Prince George, eight, and Prince Louis, three, were sitting nearer to their mum, reported OK! Unlike in previous years for Christmas photos the family were not dressed formally but had summer outfits on. “Delighted to share a new image of the family, which features on this year’s Christmas card,” wrote the Cambridges.  Princess Charlotte wore a blue gingham-patterned dress for the shoot and looked serene in front of the camera with her hands crossed in front of her and her long hair swept to the side. Fans quickly picked up on Charlotte looking a lot like her great grandmother, the Queen, and even had Her Majestyaposs typical pose.“What a handsome family. You can really see Queen Elizabeth in Princess Charlotte,” one person wrote on Twitter.“Charlotte is such cute princess, she is a the mini version of the Queen,” a second follower commented, while another added: “Charlotte is the image of the Queen. Adorable.”  The Mountbatten-Windsor family photo comes days after Kate hosted the charity carol event, Together at Christmas, held at Westminster Abbey in honour of those who have given their support to communities in need during the pandemic. It was a rare occasion where Kate was seen at a public event with the rest of her family including her parents and brother and sister. The Cambridgesapos kids were not at the event and a royal expert said they do not like to put them on ceremony at public occasions. The reality is that William and Kate have a rule that they do not take the children on any official engagements, said Duncan Larcombe about their absence at the carol event earlier this week. “It was on a school night and they are pretty strict. The children are in a rather strict regime so that might have been the reason, but the fact it was a televised official engagement shows that William and Kate are still reluctant to focus too greatly officially on their family and their children.

While taking your dog off its lead is permitted in most UK parks and wooded areas, it is in fact illegal in some spots. In lieu of signs alerting you to restrictions, it is likely fine to let your four-legged friends roam free. However, dogs typically need to be on a lead near roads, footpaths, carparks, play areas and certain ponds or streams at some times of the year. Areas like flower beds, beaches and pitches are usually considered off-limits. And dog owners should keep a keen eye out for signs alerting them to the rules, in case of any other restrictions.  Local authorities also have the power to issue a Public Spaces Protection Order , or Dog Control Order, excluding dogs from certain areas or instructing owners to put them on a lead. These orders also set out rules regarding the maximum number of dogs one person can walk at one time, and rules about dog fouling. The order comes with a maximum fine of £, – which can be issued as a fixed penalty notice in place of a prosecution. Other things you could be fined for under this order include failing to remove dog faeces, not putting and keeping your dog on a lead when asked to do so, permitting a dog to enter land they’re not allowed on, and taking more than a specied number of dogs onto a land.  Other lesser-known rules include ensuring your dog is microchipped and wearing a collar and tag in public. Dog owners can face an unlimited finetheir pet is not wearing an identity disc while they’re in public, with those failing to follow these rules facing the possibility of being served with a -day legal notice.

Hereaposs everything you need to know about where to get a lateral flow test, how to read the results and more. Where can you get a lateral flow test   The best place to start is to find outyou are able to get lateral flow tests through your workplace, school or university.However, this option wonapost be available to everyone, in which case they can be ordered from the NHS website.These lateral flow tests will be delivered to your home in a matter of days. If you are unable to use the online service, you can also order them by calling the free number  between am and pm. Luckily, the tests are generally free for all purposes apart from travel. You can also go and collect them in person at pharmacies like Boots or Lloyds, as well as some community centres. Getting tests in this way is also usually free. A pack has seven tests, one for each day of the week. And, in some cases, you will be able to get two packs at once. When should you take a lateral flow test   People who are socialising often should take lateral flow tests regularly, while the new rules also create more times when you need to take them. You mainly need to take lateral flow testsyou are unvaccinated and need a Covid pass, oryou are a close contact of someone who has tested positive, in which case you will need to test every day. If you develop Covid symptoms you will need to take a PCR test, but close contacts with no symptoms will still need to take lateral flows. They are best taken when you are due to go into an area where the spread of the disease is likely to be higher, like places with big crowds or where vulnerable people will be present. Make sure you take your test no more than  hours before the event you plan to attend for the best possible protection. Test results can be registered via the barcode strip by going on the government website. When does an infection show on a lateral flow test  The following day may often be too soon to checkyou picked up the virusyou are worried you came into contact with it. Antigen tests, like lateral flows, are less sensitive than PCRs and so require a higher viral load to show a positive result - this can lead to  positives. However,you do have a positive result on your lateral flow test, you will see a line against both the aposCapos and aposTapos markers on the test, rather than just on the aposCapos marker.So, two lines, eventhey are faint, mean you are positive for Coronavirus and will need to report this on the government website.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonPublic transportPoliticsCoronavirus testing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Meanwhile, it has been reported that the Queen will be holding her usual family Christmas gathering at Sandringham this year and may make a public appearance for the first time since early autumn.The monarch and late husband Prince Philip spent last Christmas alone as they shielded at Windsor Castle and it turned out to be their final festive season together, as the duke died aged  in April.But it appears the Covid pandemic will not force the Queen, , to cancel her usual family gathering for the second year in a row. According to reports, she is planning to host her family at her Norfolk estate and may even appear in public for the first time in months. The monarch has been resting on doctors’ orders and only carrying out light duties such as audiences since spending a night in hospital for preliminary tests on October , and later spraining her back.

Boris Johnson has already introduced his Plan B which is unpopular by many members of his own Conservative Party and those in the business community where Christmas is a key period of the year.Ministers took part in a Cobra meeting on Friday where they looked at what steps can be taken to slow the spread of the Omicron iant, it is reported. Communities Secretary Michael Grove, who himself has tested positive, said that London and Scotland were hotspots and the situation was “deeply concerning”. The new data suggests that Omicron will now become dominant by as early as next week.  Last Christmas, London was badly hit by the Alpha iant and now a year on there is talk over whether similar restrictions to those in place then could be reimposed with all  boroughs having rising cases of Omicron. Data from the Department of Health shows that infections in London rose by .% in the week up to December  which was the quickest of England’s nine regions. There were . infections among , people tested which was the highest since last January.

We know the Omicron iant is doubling every two to three days in England, and possibly even faster in Scotland. We know that % of reported cases in London are the Omicron iant and of course we only identied Omicron in this country a fortnight ago.

Speaking after the inquest, Aliceaposs father said: Aliceaposs loss is deeply felt by everyone who knew her.To her NHS colleagues at Cirencester Hospital where she worked as a health care assistant, she was a valued and greatly appreciated member of the team whose death was all the more shocking because it was completely at odds with the Alice they knew.“She bravely fought mental illness for years and she leaves behind an unfathomable hole in the lives of everyone who knew her.Alice was seconded to the NHS internal Covid track and trace programme in Gloucestershire. She wasn’t working on the wards at Cirencester .It was meant for the best, since she was classed as vulnerable to Covid due to earlier physical health issues. Unfortunately, on many days she had few or no calls to make but still needed to remain in her flat alone on standby, a fact that doubtless increased her sense of isolation and futility that was referred to during the inquest.However, we don’t blame the NHS at all for what happened. She was part of a wonderful team. It was the response to Covid. The inquest heard from aposChange Grow Live,apos an organisation that provides drug and alcohol recovery services in Gloucestershire, and was overseeing Alice’s substance misuse after she had self-referred herself to the charity in January of this year.The organisation said Alice was being treated for her cannabis and alcohol misuse.However, her contact had been sporadic until March .At the time of her death she was not being prescribed any medication by the organisation.Alice had told them that she used around one gram of cannabis on a daily basis and only consumed alcohol socially.Alice told her support worker that she suffered from anxiety and depression, but she did not disclose any suicidal thoughts, the organisation added. Police Sergeant Portman told the inquest that he attended Alice’s address and saw her in situ. He saw that she had a number of bruises and self harm marks to her body. There were no visible wounds to suggest that she had been assaulted and no signs of forced entry to the flat. He concluded that there was no third party involvement in Alice’s death, he said.Another police officer discovered Alice’s journal, which revealed the state of mind she was in at the time.A pathologistaposs post mortem report stated that Alice had consumed alcohol and cannabis immediately prior to death and that both substances have intoxicating properties which, when combined, can alter the user’s state of mind.The pathologist believed Alice had not been taking the anti-psychotic drugs that she had been prescribed.He stated that the medical cause of death was the effects of hanging.Assistant coroner for Gloucestershire Roland Wooderson said: “It is quite clear from the evidence that Alice died on April  at her home address. I accept the medical cause of death.”The coroner then offered his condolences to Alice’s family and added that anything he said wouldn’t make anything better for them.*If youaposre struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open   on  .

The Market Drayton branch in Shropshire is insulated with British sheepaposs wool and powered by wind turbines and solar  on site. Diners queueing for their Maccas can look out for wildle in the restaurantaposs bioersity garden which collects rainwater from the carpark. It also features a Drive-Thru lane made from recycled tyres, wall art made from used coffee beans and kerb stones made from plastic bottles. The pioneering site opened its doors on December  and will act as a testing site for other industry-first creations. Plans are already in place to replicate its design with the fast food chain aiming to achieve net-zero emissions for all its , UK sites by .  It is designed to retain the familiar McDonald’s look and feel to ensure it can be effectively replicated. McDonald’s Beth Hart said the company believes its food needs to be served in restaurants that are sustainable for the future adding that Market Drayton is a big step towards making that a reality. Other climate friendly features include wall art made from recycled polystyrene cups fixed in lace with starch from McDonaldaposs own potatoes.  The building cladding is made from recycled IT equipment and white household goods like washing machines while its furniture is made from  per cent recyclable materials. McDonaldaposs Simon mcWhirter said: “The challenge of decarbonising the construction industry is a complex one. But McDonald’s commitment to building the first restaurant in the UK in line with UKGBC’s net zero carbon buildings framework is a critical first step. However, campaigners are not convinced by efforts from the food giant which has been accused of greenwashing. Greenpeace describes the concept as a PR tactic thataposs used to make a company or product appear environmentally friendly without meaningfully reducing its environmental impact. Anna Jones from Greenpeace UK told Sky News: If meat and dairy are still the main course on McDonaldaposs menu, then this new restaurant initiative can only be labelled as it is: McGreenwash.

Abdul Elahi posed as a rich stockbroker on Sugar Daddy websites before blackmailing his victims into performing degrading sexual acts. The -year-old then sold the footage to paedophiles around the world in packaged boxsets - which included young women abusing themselves, siblings and their children. From the sales of his material, he would then launder the money through Amazon gt cards and buy electrical goods to sell on for cash. In one single sale, the McDonaldaposs worker traded a terabyte of twisted images and footage - amounting to , hours of video and , photos. Some of Elahiaposs victims attempted suicide after he uploaded videos of them to porn websites even bragging: Pornhub are going to love this. The warped paedophile previously admitted  online sexual offences after he targeted nearly , victims in  countries between  and . Elahi was branded depraved, abhorrent and callous by a judge as he was jailed for  years with an extended license period of eight years. Sentencing at at Birmingham Crown Court, Judge Sarah Buckingham said: Your offending is prolic and involved at least  victims.  You showed a complete and utter disregard for the welfare of every victim you manipulated irrespective of their age and there was a sadistic element to your offending. Your distribution of images was on a vast scale and allowed you to make money which you then laundered. You used multiple fake online personas to encourage women to perform sexual acts. These were not porn stars bur real women who provided the images. You were sophisticated in your operation. You wiped imagery from your phone , you packaged up these products into boxsets to be sold. There are so many examples of your sadistic and degrading exploitation and blackmail of these women it would take days to cover it all again. Your demands increased in their viciousness and brutality and however much your victims pleaded for mercy you ignored their pleas. Even when they were driven to suicide you sneered in the face of their despair. In my judgement you do pose a signicant risk of members of the public. You are an extremely dangerous inidual. You were motivated by a feeling of power and control over women, you were attracted to the financial reward you could achieve. You were utterly devoid of any empathy and regret for the pain and suffering you inflicted. Whatever your claims you did this for money I am satisfied that you harbour sadistic and paedophilic characteristics and are aroused by the abuse of children along with the abuse of women. You derived pleasure from manipulating, humiliating and distressing your victims. You were totally unmoved by their pleas to be left alone. You were prepared to, and did, offend, You showed no insight or remorse and at the same time breathtaking arrogance. You will remain a danger for some years to come. You are an example of one of the very worst type of predatory offenders ever apprehended thus far. Elahi boasted about his jet-set lestyle and how he used private jets to fly to Los Angeles – in fact, he was living with his parents and working in McDonalds. Prosecutor Andrew Langdale had branded Elahi one of the most serious sexual predators online that has been seen before this court. He added: Elahi is in a league of his own. He taught others how to abuse women and children. “This is child abuse imagery he distributed we argue he is a dangerous predator. “Abuse against others was his full time occupation. Graham Arnold, defending, said: It may be something that means nothing to the victims but he wants me to express his deepest remorse. He pushed people to do depraved things at their own great cost. He is trying to look into himself to see why and it is a very dark place. The truth is that he is struggling to find any light but all I can say on his behalf is that he is trying. Appearing alongside Elahi in the dock was Kirsty Nicholls, , who previously pleaded guilty to two charges of sexual assault of a child and one of making an indecent photo. After Elahiaposs arrest in July , officers from the NCA, the FBI, and Australian and New Zealand police found phone messages between the pair.  Elahi requested that Nicholls abused a young boy, to which she was entirely compliant and even made suggestions on how to carry out the abuse Nicholls, of Northolt, Middlesex, was jailed for six years and nine months today. Judge Buckinghamshire said: It was through Sugar Daddy websites that you encountered Elahi, the very worst type of man. One who used, manipulated and blackmailed vulnerable women to get what he wanted. The dference between you and his victims was that you were willing to do as he asked. You are intelligent and aware what you were doing was horribly wrong and in your own words sick. You became immersed in a sexualised world and became caught up in the world of online sex work without any thought of the implications.

Tressa hit the headlines  years ago when it was revealed she was expecting a baby aged just . She had suffered a damaged childhood - her mum Tracey Tallons struggled with addiction and Tressa was forced to endure late night parties. Her older brother Jason sexually abused her from the age of seven and she fell pregnant by him when he raped her four years later.  She kept the identity of the babyaposs father a secret and the pair were taken into care until - aged  - she broke down and told a social worker what had really happened.

I tell Arihannaher sister was here theyaposd play games together. I really hope that one day they can meet. It would mean the world to me. In the meantime all I want is for Arihanna to have a normal childhood, where she knows she is loved and safe. And she added: I felt pure joy the moment Arihanna was born. There were times I thought Iaposd never have another baby. But I also feel guilty, because Arihanna is with me and my older daughter is not.

The pair reside at the Princeaposs Palace in the principality and have started accompanying their dad on royal engagements and visits. This year, Jacques and Gabriella have also had to endure being apart from their mum, who has suffered health issues and is currently receiving treatment for emotional and physical exhaustion at an undisclosed location. This means she is unable to be with them on their big day but sent them a sweet birthday message on Instagram.Hereaposs what we know about Jacques and Gabriellaaposs unique lives so far... An heir for Monaco Jacques and Gabriella are the twin children of Prince Albert II of Monaco and his we of  years Princess Charlene. Albert and Charlene met in  - the same year Charlene represented South Africa in the Sydney Olympics in swimming. They married in July  but there were reports before they tied the knot that she tried to leave Monaco andto South Africa. The Palace dismissed the claims as ugly rumours. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. Jacques and Gabriella were born in  at the Princess Grace Hospital in Monaco with Gabriella arriving two minutes before her brother. Despite being slightly younger, Jacques is in fact heir to the Monaco throne due to preference being given to males. The twins also have an older half-brother and half-sister from their fatheraposs previous relationships. However, as Albert never married their mothers, they are not in Monacoaposs line of succession. School le  Like most kids their age, Jacques and Gabriella had been attending school and in a rare update Charlene remarked how her daughter loved her education so much, she wanted to go to school on Saturdays. In September, they were taken for their first day at the private LaposInstitution François d’Assise-Nicolas Barré school by Albert, and looked smart in their unorms. However, earlier this month, Albert revealed he was temporarily pulling the twins out of school so they could study at home instead. Speaking to French magazine Paris Match, he said: Jacques and Gabriella are now being educated at the palace. Albert went on to say the children arenapost learning alone and a small classroom had been set up for them and some friends. Royal appearances  Like young royals in other countries, Jacques and Gabriella have only made rare public appearances. These have included on the balcony of the Princeaposs Palace on Monacoaposs national day each December. And early this month, they accompanied their dad on an official trip to Ireland - one of the first places he visited on a royal tour. Mumaposs health battle  This year has been a particularly dficult one for the young prince and princess, who have spent large periods of time separated from their mum Charlene. Charlene travelled to South Africa earlier this year, but suffered an ear, nose and throat infection while she was there.She had to undergo surgery and was unable to travel back to Monaco, forcing her apart from her children.In August, Albert flew out to South Africa with Jacques and Gabriella and Charlene posted images of them enjoying time as a family on social media.  This led to rumours circulating all was not well in their marriage but Albert told PEOPLE : She didnapost leave Monaco in a huff! She didnapost leave because she was mad at me or at anybody . She was going down to South Africa to reassess her Foundationaposs work down there and to take a little time off with her brother and some friends.It was only supposed to be a week-long, -day maximum stay, and [she is still there now] because she had this infection all these medical complications arose. She didnapost go into exile. It was absolutely just a medical problem which had to be treated. Charlene eventually ed to Monaco in early November and her reunion with her children was described as being filled with joy and emotion.However, just days later, it was revealed that she was in a treatment facility where in Europe. Albert said Charlene was overwhelmed and couldnapost face official duties, le in general or even family le following herfrom South Africa. Last month, while appearing on the balcony of Princeaposs Palace on Monacoaposs national day, her children held up heartrendering signs saying: We love you mummy and we miss you mummy. And although she canapost be with her children on their birthdays today, she wrote on Instagram: Happy birthday my babies. Thank you God for blessing me with such wonderful children. Iaposm truly blessed. Love mom.

Loralie Henry, , has spent more than half of her le in foster care in Los Angeles, Calornia, in the US. She was first put into foster care when she was four before briefly going back to her biological mum and ing to the system aged six. Loralie said: It was actually really scary, too. I didnapost know what to expect in other homes or what they would feed me. I didnapost really know what to do. So I thought, aposWell, what should I do  Is there anyone waiting for me apos I was really scared. Until I met my mom. My second-grade teacher.  Zoe Henry is a teacher and didnapost have any plans to adopt. The single mum says the moment she saw Loralie two years ago she knew she wanted to adopt her.She added to KABC : She came into my class, and I just took one look at her - her little freckles, her little birthmark.I am going to adopt this little girl. Sheaposs my daughter. The minute I set eyes on her.  Zoe thought the little girl would get adopted by another family, but when that didnapost happen she begged social workers to let her adopt. Loralie went to Zoeaposs house two days later. The schoolgirl said: I remember the moment when we were sitting by the car, sheaposs like, aposYouaposre going to come with me.apos I was so surprised and happy. It was like an early present.  Zoe said Loralie has a lot of obstacles but now she is a brave and strong little girl. She added: She is probably the most compassionate person I know. She wants to be a foster mom someday and adopt kids. On November , which is National Adoption Day in the US, Loralie and  other kids were officially adopted by their forever families.  Zoe added: Biological parents have the right to contest. That did not happen. I know her mom really loves her. I know she really wanted to be a better part of her le. But like I tell Loralie, her mom loved her so much that she would let her be adopted so that I can give her what she needed.Matilda is a  American film based on the  Ronald Dahlaposs novel with the same.The young girl has psychokinetic abilities and comes from a disruptive family.During the film, Matilda forms a close bond with her teacher Honey - who goes on to adopt her at the end.

Kazumi, from Florida in the US, was struggling to think of gt ideas for her boyfriend before coming up with the perfect idea - sex with someone . The -year-old, who is in a polyamorous relationship with her boyfriend, recently took him to a legal brothel in the state of Nevada for an early gt. After her partner enjoyed his experience, Kazumi is now looking for her own male sex worker so she can have some fun too. “I’ve been so busy working on my OnlyFans I felt like he needed some extra loving,” Kazumi said, adding she was concerned he was lonely. “My boyfriend is a supportive partner and I feel like sometimes he is shy. She decided to suggest the idea and see what he thought - and he seemed to be interested in the idea. “We have good sex but I wanted him to explore something out of the box,” Kazumi explained. The pair were already in Vegas, so decided to pop into a legal brothel nearby. On arrival, Kazumi stayed in the waiting area while her boyfriend went off and “did his thing” during a  minute appointment. The model added she paid extra for a luxury experience for her partner - as she wanted to ensure both he and the sex worker were as safe and comfortable as possible.  Kazumi is keen to break the stigma around sex work and thinks everyone should have the chance to feel desired - eventhey have to pay for it. She said: “People shouldn’t feel ashamed for buying sex. Many people buy it and a more open conversation can make it less stigmatised. “I’ve always been interested in the sex worker world. If we want something, why not pay for it ethically in a legal brothel  “It’s no dferent to anything  – I know how to cook but sometimes I like to go a restaurant. “I know how to entertain myself but why not buy tickets to an event or watch a movie  “We’re all okay with spending money on things we like, so why not sex as long as it’s done in a safe, legal, and consensual manner  She added: A lot of people have knee jerk reactions to buying intimacy – but there really is no reason to hold that stigma when we buy everything .” Her boyfriend had such a great time enjoying his gt that Kazumi is now looking for her own sex worker to have fun with. “Maybe it’ll be his Christmas present to me,” she said.

Landlord, Rob Allcock, said he couldnapost stop watching it.Since posting the video on Twitter, many people have hypothesised that something must have fallen on top of the glass,Dorset Live reports.But Rob said this wasn’t possible . “Itaposs a single glass - theyaposre not touching and this is a toughened Guinness glass with the bottom blown out of it,” he said.  The glass was placed upside down, Rob explained, on a hygienic drip mat with a gap underneath to allow the glass to dry. Thereaposs no way anything could have hit it. According to Rob, the toughened glass at the bottom, which is not supposed to shatter, burst as though”someone had crushed it from the top”. Itaposs just really odd and you can see from my weaposs reaction, sheaposs pretty freaked out, he added. The Longs Arms pub is no stranger to paranormal activity although nothing of this nature had ever occurred before. Husband and we Rob and Liz have run The Longs Arms in South Wraxall for  years, becoming custodians near-on four years ago.  In that time a number of phantoms have presented themselves to regulars, visitors, customers and the owners, according to Rob. He recounts scenarios where children have been seen sitting with customers, eating dinner.When a customer goes to leave, theyaposd say to Rob: Wasnapost that little boy really well behaved  And heaposd explain there were just two adults sitting there, with no children. People have been pushed into the toilets from the back of their heads, while others have seen men in the garden, picking apples up. Things around the pub have been known to move around, but no glass has ever spontaneously burst before. Normally, you see things and then you look back and thereaposs no one there. Iaposll be walking through to the kitchen, which has a door that opens both ways, and it will open assomeone is on the other side, pulling it - you get used to things like that,” Rob said.  Most famously is the little black and white dog, that has been seen so vividly by all people and children alike that they actually attempt to pick him up, and kids chase him round the tables, even though thereaposs nothing there. Rob explained that when he reveals to people that the dog isnapost there, they get quite freaked out. Theyaposve seen it, and you canapost argue with someone once theyaposve seen it, he added. He added: Growing up in pubs in Liverpool, my mum always used to tell me, donapost be afraid of the ghostly things you see, be scared of the living. Iaposve always kept that with me - what are they going to do  Itaposs not a horror film, itaposs just what it is. I canapost explain it, I just donapost feel like theyaposre going to harm us. Although over the years, loads of people have told Rob and Liz, they ought to get a ghost hunter in, Rob says no way. We might see things, hear things, feel things, but itaposs all good - I donapost want to start upsetting anything - Iaposd rather just let things be. It is hypothesised that The Longs Arms dates back to the th century, however, it is not exactly known - although it is clear that the building has been an inn since . The Allcocks are the only other family after the Longs that have owned the pub in  years.

Brooke Barclay says sheaposs been accused of lying about being pregnant for attention and told she must be starving herself due to her small frame.The -year-old from Edinburgh, Scotland, was overjoyed when she discovered she and partner Liam, , were expecting their second child. She is currently  weeks pregnant, but her stomach is nowhere near the size that many people usually expect at that point along.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.Brooke, who is already mum to Leighton, three, says she first noticed her belly wasnapost getting very big at her -week gender scan, her tummy was still completely flat.However, this was something she had expected as she also experienced it during her first pregnancy.The mum explained that the reason for her smaller bump is due to her tilted uterus - and not anything to worry about.A tilted uterus means that the womb tips backwards at the cervix instead of forward, so a pregnant womanaposs baby will sit towards the back rather than the front. Brooke, who worked as a COVID- testing operative before her maternity leave, said: The reason behind me having a smaller baby bump is because I have a tilted uterus. I found this out during my last pregnancy, and it doesnapost affect the baby at all. This is common and normal, and it is how some women donapost even know they are pregnant until labour. After sharing footage of her baby bump to social media, Brooke said she was hit with mean comments, with people saying she must be aposstarving herselfapos. Others even said she must be aposlyingapos about being pregnant to get attention. Now Brooke is sharing her story in the hopes to raise awareness about the reality of having a tilted uterus and to show that not all pregnant bellies look the same.  She added: So I decided to post a TikTok at  weeks pregnant, not expecting more than my friends and family to see it. But after a couple of weeks, the views started to go up and the comments flooded in. It had a total of . million views. People were saying I was lying or starving myself and even wearing a waist trainer. There were a lot of people thinking they knew my body more than me and were telling me that I am going to have a tiny baby. These comments didnapost bother me really I knew my baby was growing fine and healthy. People automatically assume that having a tiny bump means there is something wrong with me or the baby but that really isnapost the case at all. I just wish people wouldnapost judge right away. Everyoneaposs body is dferent, and that doesnapost mean Iaposm unhealthy or underfeeding myself and baby. The expectant mum added that she and Liam are very excited to welcome their second little one. We were extremely happy finding out we were pregnant again. We had been planning and trying for just a couple of months. Even though the nerves kicked in about having two children, we still cannot wait to meet our new boy.So far, the pregnancy has been healthy but dficult, with constant morning sickness all the way through, a lot of back pain and heartburn to go with it.

It uses antibodies extracted from ostrich eggs from birds that have been injected with an inactive, non-threatening form of Covid.  Ostriches are capable of producing dferent antibodies neutralising foreign entities in the body. By spraying the antibodies on a filter from a mask, the reaction can detect whether the virus is present. President Tsukamoto and the group explained that they experimented over ten days with  Covid patients. They found that the masks they wore glowed under UV light.  The researchers said: The ostrich antibody for corona placed on the mouth filter of the mask captures the coronavirus in coughing, sneezing, and water. aposaposNext, a fluorescent dye-labelled ostrich antibody is reacted and the virus is visualised by irradiating with light. We also succeeded in visualising the virus antigen on the ostrich antibody-carrying filter when using the LED ultraviolet black light and the LED light of the smartphone as the light source.  This makes it easy to use on the mask even at home. Visualisation of the illness is possible. The presence of the virus can also be confirmed from the ostrich antibody-carrying mask used by a person infected with the new coronavirus for eight hours. There are plans to sell inspection kits to the general public in Japan and further afield, potentially even this year, once a patent has been secured for the technology.

been carried out ndash leaving the roads and pedestrian networks around the area at breaking point.Dunbar community councillor Jacquie Bell told the planning committee at its online meeting on Tuesday: ldquoThis proposal has infrastructure holes like Swiss cheese, questions that need resolving and time constraints when we need time to review.The committee was asked to approve Taylor Wimpey plans for  houses and  flats at Hallhill, Dunbar, in the final phase of a wider development in the area.Among contributions agreed between the developers and planners was pound, towards a bridge or crossing for the East Coast Main Rail Line which will be needed as part of the infrastructure of the estate.: Bid to sell alcohol from Hallhill Sports CentreEast Lothian councillor Jeremy Findlay, a committee member, raised concerns that the contribution was based on a cost for the crossing which had not been updated since .But while planners admitted that it was likely the cost for the work now would be far higher and the council was likelyto face some shortfall, they insisted the contribution had been calculated using an index to cover inflation.Councillor Lachlan Bruce asked: ldquoIs it usual to use decade-old figures for determining contributions for infrastructure for a development to go ahead He was told it was not normally the case but recalculating the cost of such a complex project could take years.Mrs Bell said that the community council had concerns which had grown in recent years as housing in parts of the estate had been built and families moved in.She said concerns about one access route, Hospital Road, had been dismissed in  by the Scottish GovernmentReporter who said it would not be used.She said: ldquoIt is now collapsing and heavily used.: Fate of rail underpass depends on housing decisionAnd she said ongoing concerns over the junction onto the A from the estate remained unresolved, adding: ldquoThe junction urgently needs an upgrade so it is galling to see developer contributions go to junctions  miles away.Mrs Bell said pedestrians were in conflict with vehicles on the roads around the estate and urged the committee to consider a continuation of a decision on the planning application until more answers could be sought.Councillor Findlay moved a motion for a delay to the decision, citing a need to update the contributions being requested for the East Coast Main Line crossing but was defeated by eight votes to three.The committee then approved the plans by  votes to one with only Councillor Findlay against.A further application for  houses at Windygoul in Tranent was unanimously approved during the virtual meeting of the committee.The application was part of a wider development in Tranent and received no

Aware of the potential economic and social impact that further pandemic restrictions might have, she said that a lot would depend onfinancial aid could be agreed with the UK treasury.In the wake of this announcement and in the anticipation of further developments in the coming days, both Orkney Islands Counciland NHS Orkney have said they are prepared to respond to any new or righter restrictions which may be announced.Asked to respond to the First Minister#s announcement, an OIC spokeswoman said:  #The council is continually assessing its response to the pandemic and holds fortnightly incident management team meetings.#It was highlighted in this morning#s meeting that more announcements were likely to be coming from the First Minister.#Now that these announcements have been made this afternoon, they will be considered by officers, including our Safety  Resilience team and where necessary urgent matters will be escalated to the Incident Management Team or Senior Management Team as required, to ensure that that the council continues to support the response to the pandemic quickly and effectively.#The situation is of course fast moving and members of the public should expect further updates in due course —  but meantime we urge all to take very regular lateral flow device tests and to follow the guidance in respect to hand hygiene, face coverings and social distancing.#In a joint statement, NHS Orkney#s chief executive Michael Dickson and director of public health Louise Wilson explained that the guidance around parties has already been in force within their staff since November.They said: #The rapidly changing national picture is to be expected as we begin to understand the Omicron iant.#The guidance issued last night by Public Health Scotland regarding deferring Christmas parties was already in place here at NHS Orkney, we asked all our staff to show caution around Christmas events and to consider alternatives to reduce risk in early November.#Additionally, we have reminded all staff to work from home wherever possible and of course we are all continuing with our regular lateral flow tests and have all mitigations in place.#As the First Minister stated “our best form of defence is vaccinations”, we’d encourage anyone who is yet to be vaccinated to get in touch with ourselves, you can do this by calling   . We are well underway with our vaccination boosters and aim to have all booster vaccines administered by the middle of January with all appointment letters out before Christmas.#From tomorrowall household contacts of confirmed cases, Omicron or not, need to isolate for  days regardless of vaccination status or a negative PCR result. Non-household contacts can end isolation after receiving a negative PCR resultdouble vaccinated and have no symptoms.#These changes to isolation for household contacts of COVID- will have an impact across the community, and NHS Orkney has robust business continuity plans to help us deliver our key services. We would encourage the community both iniduals and businesses to be mindful of these new rules and ensure they are preparedthey are requested to isolate for  days.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1639060616576.jpg--covid_19___thu_9th_december_figures.jpg?1639060617000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211209newscovid 19 thu 9th december figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

On another day of gloomy news:Daily Covid cases reached their highest level in the UK in almost a year as experts warned Omicron could become the dominant strain by mid-December.Analysis also found two doses of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines provided “much lower” levels of protection against Omicron when compared with the Delta iant. But the UKHSA said preliminary data showed vaccine effectiveness “considerably increased” in the early period after a booster dose, providing around %-% protection against symptomatic infection.UK leaders held a Cobra meeting on Friday afternoon to discuss the latest data and their co-ordinated response, with Cabinet minister Michael Gove saying the UK faces a “deeply concerning situation”.Health Minister Robin Swann said new restrictions are not inevitable here in January.On Tuesday the Department of Health said three cases of the iant had been identied in Northern Ireland which were linked to travel from Great Britain.The PHA was asked whether the positive cases travelled into Northern Ireland by ferry or plane but the organisation refused to comment.If they arrived into Northern Ireland by air, the PHA was also asked whether all passengers on the flight were contacted, asked to self-isolate and take PCR tests.They refused to comment and a spokesman said: “We do not comment on inidual cases of Covid- or go into the detail of every incident that emerges due to reasons of confidentiality.”Read MoreCoronavirus NI: Shut pubs and restaurants now to prevent new lockdown, says public health expertCovid vaccine certicates: Option to select positive PCR test added to appHe referred to an earlier statement in which the PHA said: “The PHA’s Contact Tracing Service is notied of all positive cases of Covid-.“The service speaks to these cases to identy their close contacts so that we can get in touch with them and ask them to self-isolate where necessary and undertake PCR tests.“If an inidual travelled by plane or ferry, the contact tracing service risk assesses the situation and contacts members of the public who are identied as close contacts.”However, clinical epidemiologist Dr Deepti Gurdasani saidthe positive cases arrived into Northern Ireland by air, the safest and best way to slow the spread of Omicron would be to identy and ask all fellow passengers to self-isolate.“Travel restrictions make no sensewe don’t then work to reduce the transmission from imported cases,” she said. “This virus spreads like smoke, it is an airborne virus, everyone on a flight with an infected person is at risk of catching it. It doesn’t make sense not to trace all passengers and ask them to take measures such as isolation and PCR testing.”A Department of Health document on Friday night said: “There may be particular risks associated with movement into Northern Ireland from where in the Common Travel Area in the pre-Christmas period.“It is plausible that Omicron will become dominant in January and there is a risk that without further intervention this may lead to a substantial new Covid wave and signicant additional hospital pressures.”On Friday night, Mr Swann said there are concerns about the Omicron iant, but until further information is available people should continue to do the things that are known to combat the virus. “I don’t think theyare inevitable, but let’s not kid ourselves that they may not be needed come January in regards to where we are,” he said.On Friday health officials announced , further Covid- cases and two deaths linked to the virus in Northern Ireland.

Otherwise the only people you’re going to see summoned are veterans.“If the IRA don’t come forward then they don’t get the protection. That’s how it should be.”A Northern Ireland Office source added: “These proposals were agreed by the Cabinet through collective responsibility and focus on allowing Northern Ireland#s society to move together towards a more reconciled future.“There is no doubt these issues are contentious but those agitating the most are yet to produce any viable alternatives of their own.“These proposals are the only way to truly deliver better outcomes for victims and fully protect veterans.”On Friday relatives of Troubles victims held protests at Stormont and the police headquarters to voice opposition to the controversial plans.The demonstrations outside the Northern Ireland Office at Stormont House and the nearby PSNI HQ in east Belfast were timed to mark International Human Rights Day.People who lost loved ones in incidents involving the security forces were among those who took part.An NIO spokesperson said: “The Government’s proposals to address the legacy of the Troubles were collectively agreed as the best way to deliver more information for victims and fully protect our veterans.Across Government we are united in our shared commitment to protect all those who served their country and to promote greater reconciliation for all in Northern Ireland.”Related topicsBrandon LewisMore On Brandon Lewis Premium‘NHS thank you’ gig funded through NI centenary cash PremiumEastwood: my radical climate Bill will meet a lot of resistanceUK’s Troubles amnesty plans ‘morally offensive’Government’s Troubles amnesty plan ‘dangerous and morally corrupt’, says Lord Peter HainBritish Government to work with Executive on ‘super-charging’ NI infrastructure plansMost ReadPSNI say body found in Tollymore in search for missing German-born computer expert Bernard SankePaedophile father given  years for horric attack on his -day-old son ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Coronavirus NI: Shut pubs and restaurants now to prevent new lockdown, says public health expertGruesome details of how former UDA leader Johnny Adair carried out his first murder revealed in new bookShared island already exists, Patrick Kielty saysTop VideosPlayTake a look inside the former Tesco store in Belfast’s city centre which will be an event space over ChristmasPlayWatch: Passengers given sick bags as flight attempts to land at Dublin Airport during Storm BarraPlayFirst Minister and Deputy First encourage people to take up both doses of the Covid- vaccine and the booster dose when eligibleLatest Northern IrelandBooster jab travel certicate and app update expectedNo NI river or lake classed ‘good overall’ for qualityUlster Hall defends % artist merchandise sales commission after Charlatans frontman calls out practiceRalph HewittOpinionTaking a lateral flow test is not a big deal ... people seem to forget we’re in midst of a pandemicSports stars turn out to support Mary Peters Trust eventLatestFrom Bond to Nomadland: the  best films of ‘We can’t know God’s mind...

Credit: Liam McBurneyGarrett HarganTwitterEmailDecember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailHEALTHChange in health and social care can often prove dficult and controversial and politicians have been criticised for being parochial by shirking tough decisions.Yesterday a health budget was announced of £bn over the next three years. Dr Tom Black, chair of BMA’s Northern Ireland Council, said he would urge that any agreed budget allocation for the Department of Health is used to prioritise the transformation of health and social care services.That includes: a fully-financed workforce planning strategy to support the restart of elective care and drive down our appalling waiting lists the extension of multi-disciplinary teams throughout the rest of the country which are vital to the survival of general practice, and reforming the current pension taxation system that imposes unfair financial penalties on doctors working extra shts to cover staffing gaps and drive down waiting lists.Recommendations in the Bengoa report have to be implemented. The three-year political vacuum here exacerbated chronic problems in taking dficult decisions.Professor Rafael Bengoa has said that in the face of increased specialisation and ever rising demand, it is not practical or desirable to try to deliver specialist services everywhere.Areas such as the Western Trust have faced long-term issues with filling vacancies for specialist staff. Bengoa says that for some specialist hospital treatments, it’s necessary to consolidate provision in regional centres of excellence.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up At the same time, there are many services that will be decentralised — provided closer to people’s homes, in the likes of GP centres rather than in hospitals.Northern Ireland has the highest prevalence of mental health problems in the UK, with a % higher overall prevalence of mental health problems than England. Mental health alone requires £.bn worth of funding and a -year strategy has recommended taking a regional approach to mental health services.HIGHER EDUCATIONPeople in Londonderry have been campaigning for a full-sized university since the birth of the NI Civil Rights movement in .A renewed commitment was made to deliver , students in New Decade, New Approach. However, numbers at the Magee campus have dropped from , in  to the latest available figures in  of , — of which , are full-time places.Civil Rights veteran, Eamonn McCann said“levelling up” is to make a real dference in the North West it must mean “new money to fix age-old problems”.He continued: “We don’t need vague promises about ‘development’, but concrete decisions, on rail and university expansion, for example.“It’s far, far too long since the university and rail expansion were put on the agenda by grass-roots pressure. The target of , students is very far from being fulfilled. If that can be done through Magee, so be it. If not, a new North West university must be made a practical proposition.”Garbhan Downey of the Derry University Groupsaid a new cross-border university would redress the “systemic neglect” of the region and would mitigate against the impact of Brexit. “It would also end the articial separation between Derry and Donegal, which has damaged both economies. In real terms today, there should be no more ision between our two neighbouring counties than there is between Antrim and Down.”The DUG said that while Belfast’s economy has grown by % since the Good Friday Agreement, Derry’s has contracted by %.He added: “In a comparison study, the research also showed the economy of Lincoln in the East Midlands of England has grown % since the creation of a university there in .”ROADSThe most important projects — as stated by the Executive — are the A and A dualling schemes. The A is made up of two schemes, one of which, Randalstown to Castledawson, is done and one of which, Derry to Dungiven, will be finished in .Roads expert Wesley Johnston said: “Within the Department for Infrastructurethere is a strong ambition to upgrade York Street Interchange in Belfast, but it has no funding and in any case the Minister is lukewarm on the scheme and shting public option may require the project to be reconsidered, or at least re-designed to be more sympathetic to the inner urban setting.“There is also a plan to extend Glider to north and south Belfast.”He added: “In terms of other road schemes, the focus needs to be on safety improvements and bypasses to bottlenecks. In terms of safety, the priority is the A from Hillsborough to Loughbrickland which will hopefully go ahead in the next few years.”He also referenced the bridge at Narrow Water which is to be part-funded by Dublin and of which the Minister is a firm supporter.RAILSteve Bradley from rail lobby group Into The West believes the most impactful rail project that could be rolled out is expansion from Derry-Portadown. He says it is in areas such as Derry and Strabane where better infrastructure would improve outcomes.In areas of high deprivation, limited connectivity can worsen deprivation by reducing affordable access to employment, education and healthcare. Those lacking the resources and transport options required for mobility become deprived from interacting with the whole extent of opportunities offered by society, according to a UK Government connectivity review published this year.Mr Bradley said: “SoI was the Minister and I could pick any one of Derry-Strabane, Derry-Letterkenny or Portadown-Armagh to reopen first, I’d got with Strabane first choice, and then Letterkenny.“The combined populations for each would be signicantly higher than Portadown-Armagh, and it would be Stage  of other reopenings and not just the literal end of the line. Plus, the west needs the infrastructure and the economic boost it would bring much more than the east.”ENVIRONMENT“What a Christmas gt it would be for the people of Northern Ireland to roll out an ambitious programme of railways, greenways and new urban cycle paths,” said James Orr from Friends of the Earth. “On my list would be a greenway all along the coast of Northern Ireland.”He added: “New fossil fuel infrastructure is awful for the planet and in financial terms they will be stranded assets. Rolling out the gas network and the gas caverns at Larne is sheer lunacy in climate emergency. Lets insulate people’s homes, provide smart grids and heat pumps and turn every roof on a public building into a solar roof.“A Green New Deal for Northern should start with a major programme of tackling fuel poverty with a mass home energy efficiency programme starting with those who are most in need.”This week the Belfastrevealed that seven million tonnes of waste is dumped into NI’s rivers and seas every year. NI Water requires investment of around £bn in water and wastewater services over a six year period which would go some way towards addressing those spillages.Mr Orr suggested: “We can green these projects by using natural wetlands. Plants like reeds and trees such as willow look beautul, create homes for wildle and also treat sewage. By taking an ecological approach rather than a hard engineering approach we can save money in the long term as they are much cheaper to run.”SPORTCasement Park is a long-running saga and a stadium whichcompleted would be a major boost for the GAA community. However, local residents have lodged a challenge to the ,-seat project which First Minister Paul Givan said could cost more than £m.Football stadia throughout the country is also in need of upgrading. In line with the Irish Football Association’s  Facility Strategy, the Stormont Executive had committed £.m to the development of football stadia after the completion of Windsor Park.The Oval was set to receive a £m investment. A second strand of £m was made available to other Irish Premiership clubs who were capable of hosting fixtures with a , capacity.The DfC Minster is actively considering the outcomes of a re-engagement exercise undertaken in relation to the programme. No funding has been awarded to date.Aaron Vennard, NI and Portadown supporter, set up a Twitter page focusing on NI football grounds years ago. In his view, the funding is insufficient but he believes Glentoran, Carrick and Coleraine’s grounds should be prioritised.“If it’s going to be a ‘regional fund’ then we need to look immediately to the West and to South Down,” he said.“Ideally the funding would be so large that we could develop an Iceland-esque plan for football that would tackle not just immediate stadium concerns but grassroots and youth training: regional stadia development,  indoor dome pitches,  outdoor pitches, , UEFA A coaches,  referees and a national football centre.“Casement Park absolutely should be rebuilt. If the Assembly has to cover the cost, then so be it, but I’d hope that there would be a provision for the stadium to be used for non-GAA sports.”BROADBANDThe Covid pandemic has emphasised the need for improved broadband infrastructure as growing numbers of people work from home and businesses offer digital services.Project Stratum, the £m Department for the Economyrun project was celebrated as NI’s largest publicly funded investment in broadband infrastructure.However, the roll-out has run in to problems including those in Enniskillen where residents whose internet connection is slow said they have been excluded.Disconnected rural areas are supposed to benefit most. Over , premises now have access to gigabit capable full fibre broadband which means they can enjoy speeds of up to Gbps.DfE plans to accelerate the roll out of the project to enable connectivity to , premises by March .Anyone who lives in an area where a broadband service with a speed of Mbps is already available or expected to become available soon is excluded from the scheme.Most ReadPSNI say body found in Tollymore in search for missing German-born computer expert Bernard SankePaedophile father given  years for horric attack on his -day-old son ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Coronavirus NI: Shut pubs and restaurants now to prevent new lockdown, says public health expertGruesome details of how former UDA leader Johnny Adair carried out his first murder revealed in new bookShared island already exists, Patrick Kielty saysTop VideosPlayTake a look inside the former Tesco store in Belfast’s city centre which will be an event space over ChristmasPlayWatch: Passengers given sick bags as flight attempts to land at Dublin Airport during Storm BarraPlayFirst Minister and Deputy First encourage people to take up both doses of the Covid- vaccine and the booster dose when eligibleLatest Northern IrelandBooster jab travel certicate and app update expectedNo NI river or lake classed ‘good overall’ for qualityUlster Hall defends % artist merchandise sales commission after Charlatans frontman calls out practiceRalph HewittOpinionTaking a lateral flow test is not a big deal ... people seem to forget we’re in midst of a pandemicSports stars turn out to support Mary Peters Trust eventLatestSomething old equals something new for youFrom Bond to Nomadland: the  best films of ‘We can’t know God’s mind...

And it felt good,” Mr Kielty added.“I know that sharing isn’t easy, offering up something that you would rather hang on to.“A shared island means challenging ourselves to go beyond our own comfort zones.“What we are prepared to give up to make things better for others, and ourselves.“In this year of centenaries, it’s easy to honour the ghosts of the past, it’s easier to sing a rebel song about a united Ireland than decide not to sing it in order to have one. Yet, we have to be honest with each other about who we are, how we feel and it’s not just trauma that gets passed down, it isn’t just a northern thing.“Across this entire island, not talking and not engaging means that other things get passed down too – one-sided history, stereotypes and, maybe the worst of all, apathy.“It’s easy in a post-Brexit world to sit in Dublin and say the British Government doesn’t care about north when the truth is for many people in the Republic, they aren’t particularly interested in it either.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming bb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-e-af-d-bf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming bb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-e-af-d-bf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming bb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-e-af-d-bf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming bb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-e-af-d-bf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Patrick Kielty said apathy is a great danger PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePatrick Kielty said apathy is a great danger  He added: “Say this quietly but the shared island we are talking about is is already happening today just up the road.

This is the best way to ensure we support those businesses which were impacted hardest by the pandemic.“While the vast majority have received and used their cards, not everyone received their cards as early as we would have wished.Therefore in order to offer these applicants more time to maximise the support for our high street businesses, I am extending the deadline to use the Spend Local cards to midnight on December .Most ReadPSNI say body found in Tollymore in search for missing German-born computer expert Bernard SankePaedophile father given  years for horric attack on his -day-old son ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Coronavirus NI: Shut pubs and restaurants now to prevent new lockdown, says public health expertGruesome details of how former UDA leader Johnny Adair carried out his first murder revealed in new bookShared island already exists, Patrick Kielty saysTop VideosPlayTake a look inside the former Tesco store in Belfast’s city centre which will be an event space over ChristmasPlayWatch: Passengers given sick bags as flight attempts to land at Dublin Airport during Storm BarraPlayFirst Minister and Deputy First encourage people to take up both doses of the Covid- vaccine and the booster dose when eligibleLatest Northern IrelandBooster jab travel certicate and app update expectedNo NI river or lake classed ‘good overall’ for qualityUlster Hall defends % artist merchandise sales commission after Charlatans frontman calls out practiceRalph HewittOpinionTaking a lateral flow test is not a big deal ... people seem to forget we’re in midst of a pandemicSports stars turn out to support Mary Peters Trust eventLatestFrom Bond to Nomadland: the  best films of ‘We can’t know God’s mind...

Bamford.The workforce was back up to  last year, according to the company’s annual accounts, with the firm announcing in the summer a further  positions would be created as it maps out a strategy to become a leader in the field of zero emission buses.Mr Givan visited Wrightbus “to see the groundbreaking technology that is powering zero emission buses across the UK and Ireland”, according to the

Wrightbus has a clear plan in place to reduce the costs of the buses to be comparable to diesel for the total cost of ownership.“Not only will it secure and grow jobs at our factory in Ballymena, it

Photo: Getty ImagesDecember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThroughout the pandemic, we have been told our actions and decisions on public health measures will be led by the science.But what happens when even the scientists don’t have the answers At a media briefing with the chief medical officer and chief scientic adviser earlier this week, neither were able to say with certainty what Omicron means for Northern Ireland.They were able to tell us it will likely be the dominant iant here at some stage shortly after Christmas and that modelling is currently being updated to try and forecast its impact.Even with this work ongoing, a Department of Health document this week made some worrying predictions.Prior to the arrival of Omicron here, hospital occupancy was below the least severe scenario, it said.Not exactly a comforting assessment of the current state of the health service.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up More concerning, however, it warned: “It is anticipated that this picture will change rapidly with the emergence of Omicron.”At the moment, we are very much reliant on watching the pandemic pan out in South Africa, where Omicron was first identied.It appears to be infecting younger age groups, but that has tended to be the pattern with earlier iants, and the infection inevitably makes its way into older, more vulnerable age groups.Not enough time has passed yet to accurately assess the impact on hospitalisations and there is some suggestion that Omicron leads to less severe illness than Delta.If indeed this is the case, there are some who have celebrated this as a positive development, but it must be tempered by the real possibility that Omicron is more infectious than Delta.If this is the case, as the maths suggests, the effects would be disastrous.For example,Delta infects , people and % of them require hospitalisation, that would mean  Covid- patients taking up beds.Turning to Omicron,it infects , people and % need hospital treatment, that would mean an additional  Covid- inpatients for a system already stretched to breaking point.The argument for taking quick and decisive action was made on Thursday night, with Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, appealing to countries to act now.“Even though we still need answers to some crucial questions, we are not defenceless against Omicron or Delta,” he said.“The steps countries take today and in the coming days and weeks will determine how Omicron unfolds.“If countries wait until their hospitals start to fill up, it’s too late. Don’t wait. Act now.”Returning to the science, this seems like a logical argument to make.We know there is a lag time between infection and hospitalisation, and a further period before patients become so unwell that they require critical care or even die.By the time we get clear answers about the danger posed by Omicron, with a doubling rate believed to be in the region of three days, it will already have a firm hold on the Northern Ireland population.What we do now decides the trajectory of the pandemic in the weeks and months ahead.So, why isn’t the Executive taking more decisive action now to slow the spread of a iant that could potentially cause disaster There are cynics who believe the emergence of Omicron has come at a convenient time to encourage more people to be vaccinated and adhere to the likes of face coverings.But in reality, it couldn’t have come at a worse time for politicians eager to keep voters on side.Here we are, two weeks before Christmas with thousands of people preparing to travel around the UK to reunite with family and friends.At the same time, financial supports such as furlough have ceased and we are trying to rebuild our fragile economy, while also attempting to find a balance between social mixing over the festive period and suppressing an airborne virus.After almost two years of draconian restrictions, people are fed up and an increasing number are rebelling against, ignoring, or simply forgetting even the most basic public health measures.All this at a time of waning immunity and while the health service copes with normal winter pressures, an exhausted workforce and the consequences of spiralling hospital waiting lists.Even a small rise of Covid- inpatients could prove to be too much for the NHS.Yet, move now on restrictions and it turns out Omicron isn’t such a disaster after all and the politicians will never be forgiven by the voting public.However, put in place additional measures now that actually stop the health service from collapsing in January and there will be plenty who will complain the absence of a crippling Covid- wave is proof they were never required in the first place.Isn’t it the case that health minister Robin Swann is still being pilloried for his warnings of a Covid- death toll of biblical proportions as he made the case for lockdown Another factor likely to be playing a role in how the Executive responds is whether Westminster will fund support packages for businesses affected by any measures put in place now.The chances of Boris Johnson loosening the purse strings to cover the cost of our Omicron strategy while similar measures aren’t in place in England are remote.Ultimately, and probably most importantly, who wants to be the politician seen to be cancelling Christmas The Executive didn’t want to do it last year and that was without an Assembly election just months away.Most ReadPSNI say body found in Tollymore in search for missing German-born computer expert Bernard SankePaedophile father given  years for horric attack on his -day-old son ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Coronavirus NI: Shut pubs and restaurants now to prevent new lockdown, says public health expertGruesome details of how former UDA leader Johnny Adair carried out his first murder revealed in new bookShared island already exists, Patrick Kielty saysTop VideosPlayTake a look inside the former Tesco store in Belfast’s city centre which will be an event space over ChristmasPlayWatch: Passengers given sick bags as flight attempts to land at Dublin Airport during Storm BarraPlayFirst Minister and Deputy First encourage people to take up both doses of the Covid- vaccine and the booster dose when eligibleLatest Northern IrelandBooster jab travel certicate and app update expectedNo NI river or lake classed ‘good overall’ for qualityUlster Hall defends % artist merchandise sales commission after Charlatans frontman calls out practiceRalph HewittOpinionTaking a lateral flow test is not a big deal ... people seem to forget we’re in midst of a pandemicSports stars turn out to support Mary Peters Trust eventLatestFrom Bond to Nomadland: the  best films of ‘We can’t know God’s mind...

Dublin Airport has asked those who do travel this Christmas to be mindful of the Covid- rules. “Face masks are mandatory at Dublin Airport and must be worn when in the terminal buildings” the statement said. “In addition, social distancing protocols should be observed and there are more than , hand sanitisers located throughout the Dublin Airport campus. “Anyone planning to greet passengers should arrange to meet them outside the terminal buildings. “There are new meeting points just outside Terminal  and at the glass walkway between the Terminal  car park and arrivals. “It is recommended that anyone who is collecting passengers at Dublin Airport plan and arrange pick-ups in advance.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Primark shops in the Netherlands have been hit by restrictions in trading hours, in Germany customers need vaccine passes, while its five shops in Austria have all closed. But in the months ahead things are unlikely to get worse than they were at the same time last year, when most of the chain’s shops were closed. Between December and April sales are expected to be “signicantly better” than in the same period a year earlier, AB Foods told shareholders. The business also has several other wings, including grocery, sugar, ingredients and agriculture businesses. These have all traded in line with expectations since the start of the financial year in September. “We are experiencing the impact of widely reported port congestion and road freight limitations and our businesses have been working hard to overcome these dficulties,” AB Foods said. “We have seen an escalation in the cost of energy, logistics and commodities and we have been implementing plans to offset these through operational cost savings and, where necessary, the implementation of price increases.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

But some struggle to adapt, and find they need to hold their book at arm’sto read the page or direct a light on it to see the words more clearly. For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

It also states the need for increasing the notication period for utility companies to implement price rises and introducing a cap on energy company profits. On publishing the report, Ms McLaughlin said:“Households across the North are struggling right now. Between the cut to Universal Credit, increasing national insurance contributions, the runaway cost of oil, gas and electricity, people are finding it really dficult to make ends meet. To date, our First Ministers have shown no political will or, it has to be said, interest in tackling it. “The SDLP is publishing this action plan, setting out our view on how hard-pressed households can be supported in the short and long term. This includes direct support by extending the Winter Fuel Payment to Universal Credit recipients who have already had their payments cut by the Tory Government and facilitated by Sinn Feacutein Ministers. We are also proposing a Warm Home Discount Scheme that would reduce energy costs by facilitating the installation of insulation while decarbonising our housing stock. “We are also seeking to reform the structural issues that have led to successive price rises at short notice to households. That should include extending the period that companies must give notice to consumers before a price rise takes effect. This will allow families time to prepare for signicant increases rather than being caught on the hop at times like Christmas when energy use is traditionally higher. “I don’t believe that the First Ministers understand the scale of this crisis. Nor do they seem to be engaged in the action needed to relieve pressure on people across the North.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Leading Chamber, I have worked diligently to have the voice of North West business heard at all levels of government, North, South, and beyond our island, working constructively to find solutions and secure support for our members. “Despite the challenges of both Brexit and Covid-, this year has seen great successes, with high points being the sign-off of the City Deal, the long-awaited opening of the Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee and the announcement of the poundm Health Hub at Fort George. We have welcomed new companies to the North West and FDI is strengthening in our region. “When things have been at their toughest, we have often been at our best, and the sense of community, camaraderie, and support among members has been genuinely inspiring to see. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our members,recognising the s they have gone to in protecting their people and their businesses, and I commend them for all they have done for our community during the pandemic. “I would like to thank the Chamber team and directors for their support and wish Aidan and Selina the best of luck for . I am certain that they will represent our region with strong, committed, and dynamic leadership.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Niamh said: “I want to model full time which is one of the reasons I entered the competition. I model around Derry and Belfast and one of the photographers I work with in Derry sent me a link online to enter the competition. “The next day the organiser of the competition, Greg, rang me and told me I was accepted and walked me through the next steps. “It was my first ever show and I had no experience in runway modelling. I wanted to enter because I thought it would be a great way to get experience of runway modelling and performing in front of crowds. It’s also a great way to get more exposure all around Ireland and beyond.” In a normal year, without Covid restrictions, the competition normally has three stages A photoshoot workshop, a fitness workshop and then the finals. This year, due to Covid, there was one photoshoot workshopin October last year in Dublin and the fitness workshop was cancelled as it wasn’t possible to do with social distancing. The finals which were originally supposed to be held in December  but they were delayed to January this year as a result of lockdown. This was then delayed again to allow for a more normal setting for the finals. Niamh continued: “The finals took place this weekend, December , so it’s been a long road. “The competition is full of challenges and tests to see that the winner is fit to head off and represent Ireland at swimsuit USA in America. “So, throughout the competition the photoshoots and workshops and working with other brands is all a test for howprofessionalyou are and how well you can work with photographers, brands and other models. “It’s also about a healthy body and lestyle so they’re looking for someone who is passionate about physical and mental health. “For example, one of our challenges throughout was promoting our sponsor, Beauty Belle, on social media s and doing weekly posts. Then, the big challenge at the final to test how confident you are in front of a crowd. “I absolutely loved the experience and I’m so grateful for it, the final reallywasa night I’ll always remember. “I was terried when I was travelling to Limerick but when I got there and out on stage I was really in my element and it confirmed this is exactly the kind of thing that I want to continue doing in the future. “I love the rush I get being out of my comfort zone andthatswhat modelling does for me, nerves are good. “I was disappointed that so many of the opportunities throughout were held off or not able to happen because of Covid, I would’ve really liked to spend more time with the other girls and get to know them more as they were lovely and made the whole experience. I was one of two girls from the North, I didn’t get to see much of them. I was also really pleased with placing top six at my first ever show, I would’ve just been happy to complete it. The whole experience really boosted my confidence. “I really want to say a big thank you to The Beauty Edit makeup shop inFoyleside, my personal trainer, Peter Ward, and my friends and family who supported me especially my Mammy, Shauna and my best friend, Erin who travelled to Limerick with me. “Over the next year, in preparation for Miss Bikini  , I will be taking up any opportunities I can to grow my confidence and to grow as a person and grow my . I will be training so I can be the best candidate possible next year. “This year, I did the show for the experience and fun but it’s made me realise how much I want the title now and I don’t plan on letting anything distract me from it in the next year.” To support Niamh’sjourney for the next year, follow her on Instagram at:niamh.hawes  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Niamh said: “I want to model full time which is one of the reasons I entered the competition. I model around Derry and Belfast and one of the photographers I work with in Derry sent me a link online to enter the competition. “The next day the organiser of the competition, Greg, rang me and told me I was accepted and walked me through the next steps. “It was my first ever show and I had no experience in runway modelling. I wanted to enter because I thought it would be a great way to get experience of runway modelling and performing in front of crowds. It’s also a great way to get more exposure all around Ireland and beyond.” In a normal year, without Covid restrictions, the competition normally has three stages A photoshoot workshop, a fitness workshop and then the finals. This year, due to Covid, there was one photoshoot workshopin October last year in Dublin and the fitness workshop was cancelled as it wasn’t possible to do with social distancing. The finals which were originally supposed to be held in December  but they were delayed to January this year as a result of lockdown. This was then delayed again to allow for a more normal setting for the finals. Niamh continued: “The finals took place this weekend, December , so it’s been a long road. “The competition is full of challenges and tests to see that the winner is fit to head off and represent Ireland at swimsuit USA in America. “So, throughout the competition the photoshoots and workshops and working with other brands is all a test for howprofessionalyou are and how well you can work with photographers, brands and other models. “It’s also about a healthy body and lestyle so they’re looking for someone who is passionate about physical and mental health. “For example, one of our challenges throughout was promoting our sponsor, Beauty Belle, on social media s and doing weekly posts. Then, the big challenge at the final to test how confident you are in front of a crowd. “I absolutely loved the experience and I’m so grateful for it, the final reallywasa night I’ll always remember. “I was terried when I was travelling to Limerick but when I got there and out on stage I was really in my element and it confirmed this is exactly the kind of thing that I want to continue doing in the future. “I love the rush I get being out of my comfort zone andthatswhat modelling does for me, nerves are good. “I was disappointed that so many of the opportunities throughout were held off or not able to happen because of Covid, I would’ve really liked to spend more time with the other girls and get to know them more as they were lovely and made the whole experience. I was one of two girls from the North, I didn’t get to see much of them. I was also really pleased with placing top six at my first ever show, I would’ve just been happy to complete it. The whole experience really boosted my confidence. “I really want to say a big thank you to The Beauty Edit makeup shop inFoyleside, my personal trainer, Peter Ward, and my friends and family who supported me especially my Mammy, Shauna and my best friend, Erin who travelled to Limerick with me. “Over the next year, in preparation for Miss Bikini  , I will be taking up any opportunities I can to grow my confidence and to grow as a person and grow my . I will be training so I can be the best candidate possible next year. “This year, I did the show for the experience and fun but it’s made me realise how much I want the title now and I don’t plan on letting anything distract me from it in the next year.” To support Niamh’sjourney for the next year, follow her on Instagram at:niamh.hawes  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

I am calling on the Education Minister to introduce regulations to cap unorm costs and provide statutory guidance to schools to ensure school unorms are made affordable for families. “A recent poll of parents showed that % were concerned about the rising costs of unorms and PE gear, while % said they getinto debt to cover the costs. Unorms and PE gear are costing parents hundreds of pounds, per-child, every year. This is unacceptable and must be addressed. With the cost of living rising, urgent action is needed to support families and I am calling on theEducation Minister to legislate to ease the burden of school unorm costs.

Since April of this year, there have been  donors and families who have enabled  patients to receive a le-saving transplant in Northern Ireland. Statistics have shown that % of people in Northern Ireland support organ donation, but only % have signed the Organ Donor Register. Mayor Warke said: Making the decision on whether or not to become an organ donor is a big decision and a personal one for each inidual. Its important that we all take the time to think about our own choice, and to share that choice with our family and friends. Christmas is a time for giving, and one of the greatest gts that any of us could give is the gt of le. The statistics around organ donation are really quite incredible. One organ donor can save the lives of up to nine people, and with around  iniduals currently on the waiting list in Northern Ireland, every single donor makes a huge dference to potentially saving someones le. Its vitally important to remember that loved ones will always be involved before any organ donation can go ahead.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

They provide training and education to make the Deaf community hearing aware, and the hearing community deaf aware. Rose Ayling-Ellis is making history as the first deaf contestant to compete on Strictly Come Dancing, and information officer for the charity, Pauline Doherty last night heaped praise on the -year-old dancer.  “It is great to see Deaf Culture being recognised. Deaf Awareness and sign language shouldbe taughtto everyonein schools,” she said. In a recent episode, Rose and her partner Giovanni danced a section of their performance without any music and Pauline found that moment very important for the Deaf community. “When Rosie danced with no music to show hearing people what Rosie was feeling, it was fantastic,” said Ms. Doherty. Rose has been an inspiration to young people all over the UK and the Dungiven based charity have been unequivocal in their praise for young dancer. “Rose is fantastic, I love watching her and I really hopes she wins,” said Wendy Cassidy, cleaner at Hands That Talk. Paddy Bradley the caretaker smiled and said “Yes, Rose is very good. It’s nice to see Deaf people on TV,” he added.  Lynch’s double staff with opening of third local Eurospar supermarket  Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand   Project officer, Ruairi Bradley admitted he wasn’t an ardent fan of the programme, but can see how Rose’s reach is widespread. “I don’t watch it but my we does and she loves it. She cannot wait to see Rose every week, and she hopes Rose will win it,” he said. Hands That Talk provide a comprehensive programme that includes educational courses, training, recreational and social activities including a Signing Choir. Further information on courses or outreach projects can be found via their website.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

After continuing with his le, as best he could, he collapsed last year in his garden with back and leg pain.

On Friday, June , their  and  U Feacuteile teams will play in a novel charity game, with all the funds going help Kevin and his family. “We are trying to raise as much money for Kevin and his family as possible,” said Philip Muldoon, one of the organisers. “We want the good people off Ballinderry and surrounding areas to come along and donate on the night of the match to keep the date free. “To any business people who would like to sponsor a prize for the raffle in the Bridge Bar afterwards they can do so by contacting myself or Karl Conlan. “Kevin is going to need a lot of help post and pre surgery and this will go a long way to doing that.” To mark the occasion Noel ONeill of Arboe based company ND Sports has made the outstanding gesture of sponsoring a one-off retro top for both teams.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

I am contacted about cleansing issues on a daily basis and while working with council staff a solution is found, butrobust processes and procedures were in place, this should be routinely completed and no major issues should arise.Cllr Sharvin says he is also keen to see greater attention on cleaning play parks, explaining that currently there is no formal process to do so and operates on adhoc basis.ldquoGiven the increase of use play parks during Covid and the councilrsquos objective to increase healthy living in our communities, itrsquos vitality important that we clean and maintain our play parks on a regular basis. Council officials have agreed to replace surface safety tiles at our play parks and I hope this programme will continue to be rolled out, he said.Cllr Sharvin said that following the recent workshop, council officers are to compile a report which will be discussed by councillors..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"District’s battering from Storm Barra  ","story":"DOWN District was pummelled by Storm Barra yesterday with gale force winds and driving rain coinciding with a spring high tide to wreak havoc.Thunder and lightning was added into the heady weather mix with the storm conditions bringing down a number of trees along the coastline.

pop royalty and real-le royalty, George Lowdenrsquos guitars are known to be the best in the world.The Prince of Wales recently made known his knowledge of and fascination with Georgersquos guitars and Ed Sheeran reportedly likes to keep one handy in nearly every room of his house.With Niall Horan of One Direction and Dubliner singer songwriter Dermot Kennedy becoming the latest owners of the bespoke guitars, Georgersquos company, Lowden Guitars, has just announced its latest collaboration with Sheeran.To celebrate the release of his most recent album, Sheeran has teamed up with George, who founded the firm in , to design and create a signature guitar worthy of music royalty.The Sheeran by Lowden Equals Edition guitar will also be available to the public to purchase, with a limited edition run of , available through Lowdenrsquos global dealer network.Itrsquos the second joint project with Sheeran, following on from their range of more affordable guitars.The latest achievement comes in the wake of George recently meeting the Prince of Wales at a Windsor Castle reception to mark Lowden Guitars winning the  Queenrsquos Awards for Enterprise.He also launched a new range of limited edition guitars to mark his th birthday over the summer which features specications chosen by George.Itrsquos all a far cry from when the renowned luthier first began to hand-make guitars for his own use.He could never have known that his determination to make the best guitar would see his name travel around the world and be spoken of by royalty.ldquoTherersquos quite a lot of things that have happened that I never could have imagined. When I started out, I had no formal training in the manufacture of guitars, explained George.ldquoIn a way, that gave me the confidence to take some risks, innovate and produce an instrument that has a completely unique voicing.He found the Prince of Wales to be very interested in the guitarsrsquo manufacture and may have even suggested a new development.ldquoWe had a great chat and he asked quite a lot of questions about the wood, all kinds and how we found it, said George.ldquoHe was also very interested in dieback ash, asking aboutit would be a very good way to use the trees as a lot have perished due to this disease.ldquoIt wouldnrsquot be the best toned wood you could find but Irsquove been thinking more about that since and wondering whether we could use it for guitar necks or not so we might do a little experiment to seeit works.From creating coveted instruments for top Irish and UK guitarists in the know, Lowden Guitars have become an international sales success mdash hence the Queenrsquos Award.George explained: ldquoThe company is far bigger than I ever envisaged. In some ways itrsquos good but I never tried to expand the company and get the kind of growth we have enjoyed. It just kind of happened over the years as organic growth which has been great.His guitars tend to sell by word of mouth from musician to musician and the actual experience of playing a Lowden and relishing its distinct tones at first hand.ldquoWherever in the world where we sell, we are still quite a niche, upper end company so the guitars are at the highest price level in all of the countries, said George.ldquoItrsquos a natural process where people see the guitars for the first time. They go into a shop and then over a period of a few years the reputation builds within that country. Our presence also grows and then we move into more specialist guitar shops, so it all takes time.ldquoI remember as a teenager I was mad keen to get a Gibson  which I saw in Matchettrsquos shop window in Belfast all those years ago and I couldnrsquot afford it.ldquoIf something is really good, and the young player comes in and plays it but canrsquot afford it, it goes into his or her mind and later on they find a way to afford it.George says the Covid pandemic has not impact on sales, although it has had other consequences.George said: ldquoIt didnrsquot impact on us for sales as our order book remained very firm but it was more to do with making the guitars as we had to completely re-organise the factory for better social distancing which was very expensive.ldquoWe had to close down the factory for a while in order to do that and more with people having to isolate it proved challenging..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Magpies fly high in Breffni Park  ","story":"DOWN kingpins Kilcoo qualied for an Ulster semi-final after a good performance at Kingspan Breffni Park on Saturday evening, defeating Cavan-based Ramor United by  points.The Magpies, reigning Ulster champions, will meet Glen of Derry in the last four in what will be a massive clash in two weeks time.It was tit-for-tat early on but the home side got a massive confidence boost in the fth minute via a well taken Sean McEvoy goal, their most impressive performer on the night.Kilcoorsquos response was emphatic though, firstly Ceilum Doherty stuck over a nice point and then that man Jerome Johnston done what he does best and fired to the net to put his side into a lead they would never relinquish.Further scores from Ryan McEvoy, Shealan Johnston and Doherty again sent them in four up at the water-break.The second period of the first half turned out to be poor affair with both sides missing good scoring chances.

Four dedicated spaces for electrical vehicles are also included.Itrsquos understood that in addition to the  jobs in the new Lidl store, a further  will be created across the other proposed retail units, with  jobs created during construction and development.Council planners are recommending to members that the application be approved with  conditions including its full construction within a five-year period.In papers submitted ahead of Mondayrsquos planning meeting, planners said they were recommending approval as the proposed retail use is considered to comply with the local development plan.They say that when the buildings are constructed, they will not adversely impact on the character of the area or have a detrimental impact on the amenity of existing residents in properties adjoining the site.ldquoAppropriate provision is made to meet the needs of cyclists and adequate facilities are made for shower and changing facilities as required for such a major employment-generating development, the papers point out.A spokesperson for Lidl said the poundm store would reflect the retailerrsquos concept design, boasting a sales floor, a shopping environment withspacious, wide aisles, long tills, restrooms and baby-changing facilities, as well as a bakery offering and staff facilities.ldquoOur ambitious plans to complement the site with additional retail and leisure units represent an investment of more than pound million into the area and the support of more than  jobs, he said.ldquoWersquore proud to be part of the centrersquos signicant regeneration and bring a new future of growth to the locality whilst honouring the sitersquos historical connections to the community.The spokesman added: ldquoWe hope to receive planning permission for the site and look forward to opening the brand new, state-of-the-art Lidl store early next year, bringing shoppers even more choice of quality products at unbeatable value.Carryduff shopping centre was a prime retail destination for many years, but since the closure of its flagship Supervalu store in , it struggled to attract an anchor tenant that would drive its growth.The formal planning application by Lidl follows an extensive local consultation of the plans undertaken in February which was positively received by local representatives and the wider community.Lidl acquired the . acre Carryduff shopping centre site in August last year as part of the retailerrsquos plans to expand its store presence across the region to more than  stores by the end of the decade..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Newcastle harbour development plans  ","story":"THE redevelopment of the former generator house at Newcastle harbour has the potential to act as a catalyst to secure additional investment.Thatrsquos the assertion of Mournes councillor Willie Clarke whose comment came after Monday eveningrsquos annual meeting of the Newcastle Harbour Heritage Association.He congratulated the grouprsquos chairman Campbell Miller and the committee members on the ldquofantastic positive contribution they have made in improving the harbour over the past year.Cllr Clarke said the two main items discussed at the annual meeting included the refurbishment of the former generator house as a community hub and the provision of a new boarding pontoon that would allow disabled people to board vessels, something which he said is long overdue.The business case for the new floating pontoon recently passed through Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee.Cllr Clarke explained the vision for the generator house includes the provision of showers, toilets, and changing facilities for water-based recreation, alongside a meeting room for the community and harbour users.He said the business case was submitted to the local authority and approved through the so-called community transfer process.ldquoIt is essential that this building is refurbished for the local community which will be a catalyst in the development of the harbour, suggested Cllr Clarke.ldquoIn addition, it offers an excellent opportunity for the local council and the harbour community to develop a partnership to create a community hub for the area. I will be facilitating meetings with council officials to progress this vital community asset as quickly as possible.Cllr Clarke said there was no doubt that with an ldquoambitious and focused vision for the future, the harbour area could become a unique attraction, meeting the needs of not just the local community, but also become an exciting destination for those who visit Newcastle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Red High hurlers through to final  ","story":"THE first half of this Danske Bank Mageean Cup semi-final was brilliant to watchthere were any neutrals around.If you were a supporter of either St Patrickrsquos or St Louisrsquo, it was nail-biting, edge-of-the-seat drama played at a blistering pace with top class scoring at each end.That half finished - to - in favour of the Ballymena side.For the Red High management of Darren Swail, Sean Paul Gibson and Danny Toner, the entertainment factor had to be sacriced to get the result they needed.Bringing Oisin Coulter back as extra cover in defence curtailed the damage that Ballymenarsquos two Loughgiel inside forwards had done in the opening half, but it also meant that the Red Highrsquos attack would struggle to retain ball to keep the scoreboard running.Jack McCloskey had scored - in the first half and Roacutenaacuten McCollam -. McCollam fired over another point in the th minute and pointed a free at the very end while trying to it in on the Downpatrick area to poach a late goal.McCloskey didnrsquot score in the second half and being out of general play resulted in his normally reliable free-taking also taking a hit.At the other end the outnumbered Downpatrick forwards had to survive on scraps as well but they could always rely on their free-takers.Goalkeeper Pearse Smyth landed two points from inside his own half, while Tom McGrattan converted three frees and landed a point from play as well.McGrattan was the star of the game and he capped a brilliant inidual performance with two late plays that effectively took his team into the final.With the game in the balance at - each in the rd minute, McGrattan jinked his way along the sideline under the stand to win himself a free.It was an acute angle, but the Portaferry clubman arrowed the sliotar between the uprights.Then less than a minute later he played a beautul cross-field pass into the path of mid-fielder Finn Turpin, who stepped inside the defender and hit the roof of the net from  metres out.St Patrickrsquos were through to their first ever Danske Bank Mageean Cup final where they will play St Patrickrsquos Maghera at the Dub Arena on Friday week, December .But back again to that breath-taking first half.After five minutes, the teams had each scored three points. By the tenth minute, Jack McCloskey had cut through the Red High cover and shot to the net off the base of the right hand post.Within three minutes Downpatrick were a point up. McGrattan went around the left side of the Ballymena defence at full pace to rle to the roof of the net for one of the best goals that you will see at any level.Aodhan McGarry responded by pointing from a side-line and the water-break broke the action at - each.McGarry started the second quarter scoring with a fine point but a run of three successive scores from Finn Turpin, McGrattan and Oisin Coulter edged the Red High ahead again.However, three frees from Jack McCloskey and a point from Ronan McCollam put Ballymena in the lead by - to - at half-time.By the second water break Downpatrick were - to - ahead, mainly through frees and St Louisrsquo were now looking for scores from distance.The next  minutes went scoreless. In hindsight Ballymena snatched at a couple of scoring chances that might have put pressure on the eventual winners who pumped a lot of ball in high on the north Antrim defence with no .Eventually sub Tom McFerran brought the teams level and McCollam from the left wing gave St Louisrsquo the lead. The gauntlet had been thrown down for the Red High.Oisin Coulter landed a much-needed Downpatrick point in reply and they held firm until Tom McGrattan delivered the match-winning scores.It is scant consolation for Ballymena that they played their part in a fine display of schoolsrsquo hurling, but a number of players stood out including Daire McMullan, Connor Dickson and Dara Martin in defence and McCollam and McCloskey in attack until tempered by Downpatrickrsquos packed back line.Defence was ultimately the winning of the game, but they would not have got across the line without Turpin, Oisin Coulter and especially the mercurial Tom McGrattan.As a hurling disciple of the great Bro Charles in the s, I was a proud man leaving the Dub on Friday evening.For the generations of hurlers who climbed to the top of the hill on Saul Street each morning over the past  or  years, winning a Mageean was just not on the radar.This team is only  minutes from achieving what for us was the impossible.St Patrickrsquos: P Smyth - frees, J Ruddy, R OrsquoNeill, D Coulter, S Mageean, D Mallon, C Lenaghan, T Connolly -, F Turpin -, M Dorrian -, A Connolly, T McGrattan - , O Coulter -, R McGrath, S McCarthy.Subs: F MacManus for A Connolly , LMcCabe for S McCarthy , F Casey for R McGrath ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Road officials set to carry out survey at Ballynahinch school  ","story":"PLANS by roads officials to carry out a survey on the main road outside Ballynahinch Primary School have been welcomed by Strangford MLA Peter Weir.The work will be carried out to assess the potential for a new pedestrian crossing and while pleased that the survey is to take place, Mr Weir is disappointed that there are no current plans to also introduce a temporary mph speed limit at the Dromore Road as part of a province-wide Department for Infrastructure initiative.Mr Weir mdash who has met with school principal Mr Michael Moore mdash said the safety of children who have to cross the busy road was of paramount importance and a real issue of concern for parents and residents.The former Education Minister said he was ldquodisappointed that the school had not been included in the Roads Departmentrsquos part-time mph speed limit scheme.ldquoI believe that the Department needs to give a clear commitment that Ballynahinch Primary School will be included in the next roll-out of the scheme, said Mr Weir.ldquoThe Dromore Road is busy and is also a bus route.

Jimmyrsquos  is scheduled to take place on Sunday, March , and it is anticipated that interest will be high especially given that the Seeley Cup sold out well in advance.The Joe Seeley offers a flat and fast course starting on the Ormeau Embankment in Belfast with two and a bit laps through the Ormeau Park.For those watching or racing it was a sharp cold day, but miraculously the heavy rain and high winds that preceded the .pm start died down just in time to let the runners have a fair crack at a good performance.At the pointy end there were small clusters of runners who made a break early on in the first lap and then a lead group of five formed as they headed out for the second lap. The huddle of five then broke apart in the last K as they hurtled towards the finish line in break neck speed.Overall winner Owen Everardonly edged for glory in the last two strides as right to the mat it was not clear who would breach the tape first.His time of . was two seconds ahead of Matthew Neill , who was one second ahead of third-placed Eskander Turki . The top  competitors were all sub  minutes for K, which is fast by any means.East Down ACrsquos Neil McCartan, who prefers shorter distances and would choose track over road running, finished in a commendable .. This is not a personal best time, but given that this is his first serious attempt at a K in three years he will be more than satisfied. This got him well inside the top  in th place.Neil Curran reaped the rewards of his consistent cross-country racing, converting the stamina gained in that discipline to a strong road performance. He was chuffed to take  seconds off his previous best time and at . is well poised to run a sub  minute K in the near future.He said that he ran conservatively off the start as he was fearful of overcooking it and as a result ended up running solo for a large part of the distance.

Many runners set sub  minutes for K as a good base goal, but he smashed that and some.He was even more delighted to discover that he was the quickest junior athlete on the day by well over a minute. As mentioned this race stood as the NI  Ulster Championship, so he gains that title as well as a Seeley Cup age group win.A great achievement.It was actually a hat trick as he also snatched bragging rights in the Murray family as his dad Dee and mum Janine were also racing on the day.Dee was next home for EDAC in a very respectable .. Dee has been troubled by niggles and was not even surehe was going to start let alone finish, so being able to take part was more important than the result.Seamus Savage who was the next EDAC finisher is training hard to regain fitness and based on his current form he went in not expecting too much.While he enjoyed the race, he found it tough in the latter half.

Sam Anderson was glad of the cheers of club mates as she battled to the finish in one hour and seven minutes. Another race ticked off by this consistent attender. Good work by all three.Cross-countryThe Robinson brothers, Oliver and Alex, ended off their  cross-country season with a trip to the Uneven Age Group All Irelands Cross Country in Gowran, Kilkenny, on Sunday.The sun shone all day but the temperature stayed low with the ground remaining icy in parts. Alex had gained his Ulster U- team place by coming sixth at the Ulster  NI race in Donegal a few weeks previously, so he had set his expectations high.His race was ,m around a very twisty course through long grass, all of which made it more technical than previous races.The start of any cross-country race is hectic with lots of jostling and this was no exception.Alex was pulled back when the gun went off and then had to contend with some fallers so he never really got into his stride.He was disappointed to place th out of a field of  runners, but deserves huge credit for his commitment over the last few months.Alexrsquos older brother, Oliver, was running for the Down team in the U- race.

In my opinion, such an appointment is crucial and could benefit the town and the business community a great deal.ldquoThe night time economy is one area that needs to be improved not only in Downpatrick but where, but rapid progress this in the current Covid climate may not be possible.ldquoHowever, there is no reason why ideas to regenerate our night time economy cannot be discussed now to lay plans for the future, he continued.Cllr Curran said every high street is dferent, with many people keen to see them become vibrant shopping hubs at the heart of local communities, explaining that the work of the Stormont task force could not be more timely.He added: ldquoAnything that can be done to increase footfall in our town centres in the future will be more than welcome.The call for evidence document is available at https:www.executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk consultations call-evidence-high-street-task-force, while responses to the call for evidence can be made to highstreet@communities-ni.gov.uk..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13281273.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

High levels of vaccination among the population will greatly reduce the pressures on the NHS.They make another lockdown much less likely, and further lockdowns are to be avoided at all costs, given the huge social and financial damage that they cause.But the change in the Covid certication requirements in Northern Ireland from Monday are not widely understood and have not been sufficiently publicised. There has been a misapprehension that the old cards, given to people when they got their jabs, are not sufficient as proof.Last night the government said that such cards were sufficient. It would be utterly unfairotherwise. Older people who have been conscientious in getting jabbed often have no access to apps and might not have applied for a letter, which is a cumbersome process. It is fair to ask for proof of jabs in certain circumstances but not fair to make that proof too onerous.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The only thing is he has not listed a qualication in virology. With all his teaching experience he could go back to school and fill a gap for self-isolating and ill teachers.

But it was a dferent Soldier’s Song – it was not wrapped around the IRA, it was one of friendship and one of a group of people who wanted us to be out there on the pitch representing them,” he said.“Would I suggest that we look at a sporting anthem as well [at football internationals], to play in addition to God Save The Queen  I would say we did that in rugby and it works really well, because it is an extension of that constructive atmosphere.“In the medium term anyway, and maybe forever, God Save The Queen might well be played, but it would be nice to have something  [also],” Mr Ringland added.READ: Windsor Park : worst night of sectarian thuggery that never wasREAD: Opinion:  match a case study in nationalist myth making ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Their devolved Parliament, which had been opened by King George V the previous June , was given the power to vote them out of the all-Ireland settlement, based on dominion status, which the Treaty embodied.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They formed a column headed by Lloyd George himself the others, drawn from his Liberal  Unionist coalition cabinet, were Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, Lord Birkenhead , and Winston Churchill.Another column listed the signatures of three of their Irish counterparts, headed by Arthur Grfith, the founder of Sinn Fein in , and followed by the charismatic Michael Collins, the chief organiser of the IRA’s terrorist campaign against Britain, waged from  until July  when a truce was agreed between the two sides. The third Irish signatory, Robert Barton, a Unionist landowner turned Republican and an intimate friend of Collins, was the Sinn Fein delegation’s economic adviser. Never before had British and Irish representatives put their names to a formal agreement of this kind as complete equals. After the signing, which took place at . am, the two sides shook hands for the first time. Trust had replaced the deep suspicion with which they had first regarded each other. Irish leaders, who a few months earlier had been denounced as rebels and murderers, had come to enjoy the respect of the British delegation. Michael Collins had undergone an astonishing transformation from terrorist leader to statesman, gaining the admiration of two prominent members of the British team, Churchill and Birkenhead.Final agreement on the terms of the treaty had been reached in two intense negotiating sessions in the Cabinet Room at No , which ended two months of wrangling. The first session, which lasted over five hours, began at pm on December . Lloyd George employed all his formidable political skills to secure a breakthrough in all but one of the key areas that had hitherto defied resolution.The Irish gained the full fiscal and financial autonomy they craved. The British got what they wanted on defence: the use “in time of war or of strained relations with a foreign power [of] such harbour and other facilities as the British government may require”, combined with the permanent retention of what came to be known as the Treaty Ports , major strategic assets which Neville Chamberlainwas to abandon in a further Anglo-Irish Treaty in  to Churchill’s fury. Since the start of negotiations in October, the words of an oath of allegiance which Irish elected representatives would in future be required to swear had been through endless drafts. It was at last settled with a suitably convoluted rigmarole to spare the Irish republican conscience as much strain as possible: “I will be faithful to His Majesty King George V, his Heirs and Successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland and Great Britain, and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.” This was the first time on which the customary reference to Empire was dropped from an official document.There remained just one make-or-break issue: Northern Ireland, with its devolved powers over local matters entrusted to it by Westminster earlier in . Sinn Fein were determined to get it into their independent state. Lloyd George was happy to give them all the help he could. In November, he had piled pressure on Sir James Craig, the Northern Ireland prime minister. In letters and conversations he tried, with all his accustomed craftiness, to get Craig to accept that he had a patriotic duty to remove the last barrier to peace in Ireland by joining a sovereign all-Ireland Parliament in place of Westminster, while retaining all the devolved powers that Westminster had provided.The Unionist members of the British delegation did not demur. Not for the last time, Ulster Unionists found that they could not rely on their English Unionist allies in high places . Austen Chamberlain said that separate arrangements for six of the nine Ulster counties were “illogical and indefensible”. He thought “the greatest moral pressure” should be put on Northern Ireland to bring it into a settlement that was “vital to the Empire”. His party chairman, Sir George Younger , believed “Ulster should take some risks and forget some of the past arguments against unity in Ireland”.These Unionist calls for compromisewere made against the background of a sustained press campaign, led by The Times, criticising Ulster Unionists for their intransigence. “Ulster blocks the way to peace” was the newspapers’ regular refrain. Craig described it as “ a press campaign against Ulster without parallel in the history of Great Britain.”But the Northern Ireland premier was unmoved. He told Lloyd George that a single parliament for Ireland was “precisely what Ulster has for many years resisted by all the means at her disposal”.Lloyd George tried another tack in November, concentrating his cunning this time on the leader of the Irish delegation, Arthur Grfith. Here he had much greater success than in his attempts to manoeuvre Craig into an all-Ireland parliament. At a private meeting with Grfith on November , he got the leader of the Irish delegation to give a personal written pledge that,Northern Ireland refused to accept an all-Ireland settlement, it would remain under the British Parliament, “but in this case, it would be necessary to revise the boundary of Northern Ireland. This might be done by a Boundary Commission ... to make the boundary conform as closely as possible to the wishes of the people.” What went unrecorded in the paper was the clear impression given by Lloyd George that Northern Ireland would lose so much territory that it could not survive as a separate entity and a united independent Ireland would as a result come into existence.During the course of the long afternoon session in Downing Street on December , Lloyd George reminded Grfith of what they had agreed.Proof was needed. A frantic search was made of the prime minister’s wardrobe, and “eventually an insignicant pocket cast up an envelope and a piece of paper.” On the strength of this written undertaking to establish a Boundary Commission whichwould undermine Northern Ireland, the leader of the Irish delegation agreed to sign the Treaty himself, but said that he could not commit his colleagues.At this, Lloyd George assumed a magnicently melodramatic air. He had told Craig in Belfast to expect news of the outcome of the discussions in Downing Street the following day. That could of course have been done by telephone, but Lloyd George now conjured up an elaborate plan to send the news in writing to Belfast in an attempt to force a decision out of the other two Irish delegates.“Here are the alternative letters which I have prepared, one enclosing Articles of Agreement reached by His Majesty’s Government and yourselves, and the other saying that the Sinn Fein representatives refuse to come within the Empire. If I send this letter it is war, and war within three days. Which letter am I to send  Whichever letter you choose travels by special train to Holyhead, and by destroyer to Belfast. The train is waiting with steam up at Euston ... to reach Sir James in time we must know your answer by ten p.m tonight. You can have until then, but no longer, to decide whether you will give peace or war to your country.”With these impassioned words ringing in their ears, the Irish delegates ed to their Knightsbridge hotel for anguished discussions amongst themselves, but promised to be back in Downing Street by the pm deadline. In fact, it was nearly .pm when they ed.Nothing more was heard about the special train waiting at Euston. Grfith announced calmly, “Prime Minister, the Delegation is willing to sign the agreements, but there are a few points of drafting which perhaps it would be convenientI mentioned at once.” The most important concerned the Boundary Commission redrafting increasedthe likelihood that Northern Ireland would collapse. At Iam on December , an agreed text was handed to the Downing Street typists.In England, reaction to the treaty was ecstatic. The Times led the way: “These are fitting peace terms to mark the close of an age of discontent and distrust, and the beginning of a new era of happiness and mutual understanding.” In Ireland, discontent intensied and took a new form: the long quarrel with Britain was replaced by distrust and ision within Sinn Fein, which led to a bitter civil war the following year. In Northern Ireland, IRA terrorism increased, generating sectarian stre in  parts of Belfast came to resemble the battlefields of the First World War. The Boundary Commission recommended only minor changes, and its report was shelved. Englishmen looked away. “The country”, said Austen Chamberlain, “wants peace and is tired of Ireland and Ulster.” English politicians hoped they would never have to think seriously about Irish affairs again. For nearly  years they had their wish — which meant that that they were fatally handicapped by ignorance when the Ulster crisis of  erupted.l BIBLIOGRAPHY—D.G.Boyce, Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy -and “ How to Settle the Irish Question: Lloyd George and Ireland -” in A.J.P.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe complaint to the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales against the Cardf and Vale University Health Board was lodged by the patient -referred to in the complaint as lsquoMr Drsquo -who was unhappy with the care and treatment he received at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardf during and after a scheduled admission for surgery to remove the right side of his colon.Mr D, who has Aspergerrsquos Syndrome, complained that hiscondition - at the time believed to be Crohns Disease -was not clearly diagnosed and that clinicians were slow to identy he suffered a post-operative bleed and needed further emergency surgery.He complained that information about his treatment and care was not provided clearly to him despite those caring for him knowing about his Aspergerrsquos Syndrome. He was also unhappy with aspects of his care after his discharge.Mr Drsquos surgery was carried out on the presumption that he had Crohnrsquos Disease according to the Ombudsman, but surgical findings suggested complex chronic appendicitis.The Ombudsman found that neither of these conditions needed the extensive surgery that Mr D was given. The Ombudsman also found there was no complete record of how his condition was monitored following his surgery and that his post-operative bleed might have been detected sooner.The Ombudsman also concluded that the clinicians were aware of the patientrsquos Aspergerrsquos Syndrome but did not clearly communicate the information about his diagnosis and treatment to him. The Ombudsman also found that the patient was not seen by a mental health clinician as requested by Mr D because it was not arranged.MORE NEWS:The Ombudsman did not uphold the complaint regarding Mr Drsquos care post-discharge.Nick Bennett of Public Services Ombudsman for Wales said: ldquoThis regrettable case highlights yet again the importance of one of the key principles of prudent healthcare formulated by the Welsh Government ndash lsquodo only what is needed and do no harm.rsquoldquoPhysicians responsible for Mr Drsquos care should have employed a lsquowatch and waitrsquo approach in which his condition would probably have settled without surgical treatment.ldquoInstead, Mr D, a vulnerable inidual, faced completely avoidable trauma of unnecessary surgery and post-treatment complications ndash a trauma which saw him seek mental health support. I anticipate that my findings will be extremely distressing for him. This is reflected in my recommendations in this case.The Ombudsman recommended that Cardf and Vale University Health Board provides Mr D with a detailed apology and a redress payment of pound,. Mr Bennett also recommended that the physicians and nurses involved in Mr Drsquos care have relevant training in the management of Crohnrsquos Disease and chronic appendicitis as well as the care and management of patients with Aspergerrsquos Syndrome.It was also recommended that the nursing team consider the importance of conducting and documenting post-operative observations and of preparing accurate and relevant care plans.The Ombudsmans report says Cardf and Vale University Health Board has accepted the findings and conclusions of the Ombudsmanrsquos report and has agreed to implement the recommendations.A spokesperson for Cardf and Vale University Health Board said: \"As a health board we would like to reiterate our sincere apologies to Mr D for the concerns identied in the report.\"We are implementing the recommendations from the Ombudsman and an improvement plan has been developed to monitor the delivery of all recommendations within the agreed timescales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityExactly how fast the city should grow is up for debate as Cardf council launches a major consultation on its local development plan.Another issue is how many of these new homes should be built in the countryside or in urban areas.The development plan is a hugely important council document shaping how the city will evolve until , and the consultation runs for  weeks until February .The first phase of the consultation looks at how many new homes and jobs the city might need over the next  years, with three specic options. Currently developers already have plans for an extra , homesmdashwhich havenrsquot yet been builtmdashthanks to the existing local development plan.Although, itrsquos possible that not all of these will actually be built. Some additional lsquowindfall sitesrsquo are also likely to come forward, where developers build homes not allocated in the development plan.So factoring these in, the first option would mean an extra , homes needed, as well as , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , by .The second option would mean an extra , homes needed, and , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , homes by . This could mean more affordable housing.The third option would mean an extra , homes needed, and , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , homes by . This is based on population growth projections from the previous development plan, which some critics say were too high.Councillor Caro Wild, cabinet member for strategic planning and transport, said: ldquoThe replacement LDP is going to shape the look and feel of Cardf for years to come, so it was really important for us to hear as wide a range of views as possible. At this stage of the process, we are accessing a number of dferent scenarios on the possible levels of growth in Cardf up to , and the need for houses to be built to accommodate this growth..removeldquoIt is important that people understand the consequences of the options, as most growth scenarios will have pros and cons with regard to important issues such as land for employment opportunities, the impact on the environment, addressing housing need, supporting the delivery of community and transport infrastructure, and how many truly affordable homes that could be provided.People can respond to the consultation by visiting the website https:cardfldp.consultation.ai, while there will also be focus groups to gather views of people who donrsquot normally respond to council consultations.The next phase of the consultation explores eight options on how the city should accommodate a growing population, and how many homes should be built in the countryside or in urban areas.Option one would extend the existing strategic sites, built on countryside on the outskirts of the city. This would mean more affordable homes and a wider range of housing, due to the cheaper construction costs of building on greenfield sites.Options two and three would see new homes built mostly on urban brownfield sites, meaning land which has already been developed. This would mean denser housing, and could be more expensive to build with less range in size. Option four is similar, but focusing on building around existing district centres to create a lsquocity of villagesrsquo concept.Option five would see new homes built around existing transport links in urban areas while option six would focus growth around proposed transport improvements like the metro and planned new train stations, including on some greenfield sites.Option seven would focus on greenfield sites not already earmarked for development, on countryside on the outskirts of Cardf. Option eight would be a mix of using greenfield and brownfield sites, in urban areas and the countryside, to get the best of both.Cllr Wild added: ldquoAt this stage of the process, all of the options that are presented in the consultation are potential options, rather than preferred options. The preferred strategy could combine a number of these options together. All of the feedback from the public will be considered, alongside further technical work, which will help the council prepare the preferred strategy that will be consulted on with the public in autumn .This consultation follows a previous one held earlier this year, which focused on what the broader goals of the replacement development plan should look like. This included exploring how the city should face problems like coronavirus and the climate crisis. The final plan is expected to be approved in October . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityPollsters Yougov surveyed a sample of people from Wales and the rest of Britain, asking them whether they would support or oppose banning people who have not been vaccinated against coronavirus from visiting public places.Such places would include events and non-essential shops, Yougov suggested.The poll comes as some countries attempt to ramp up vaccination rates by either threatening new restrictions or making jabs mandatory.Political leaders in the UK have downplayed the prospects of such restrictions being introduced, but other European nations have already begun taking steps to curb freedoms for unvaccinated citizens.The Yougov poll found that in the Wales and Midlands area, nearly two-thirds of peoplesaid they would either strongly support, or tend to support, banning unvaccinated people from non-essential public places.Just one in four peoplesaid they would oppose such restrictions on the unvaccinated.The regional results largely match the total response from Wales, England and Scotland, which showed  per cent would support a ban and  per cent would oppose it.MORE ON CORONAVIRUS:Yougov uses sampling data to measure public attitudes to current events and issues. In this case, some , people across Britain, including  in the Wales and Midlands region, responded to the survey. While the sample cannot give a  per cent accurate record of public opinion, it does provide a helpful indicator of which way the wind is blowing when it comes to any future Covid policies on vaccinations and restrictions.A few days ago, Germany announced it would be reimposing some restrictions across the nation, as well as bringing in tough new measures aimed specically at unvaccinated people..removeMany leisure and entertainment venues will only be accessible for people who have either been vaccinated or who have recently recovered from Covid, and the German parliament will also consider a general vaccine mandate which,passed, could come into force as soon as February next year.The nation follows neighbouring Austria, which last month brought in lockdown-style rules for people who have not been vaccinated. Around  per cent of people in Austria have been fully vaccinated ndash one of the lowest rates in western Europe.By comparison, some  per cent of people in the UK have been given both jabs, and booster vaccines have already been administered to . per cent of those people who are currently eligible.Asked on Fridayvaccines could ever be made mandatory for the general public in the UK, a spokesman for Downing Street told reporters: \"Wersquove set out our policy on this and wersquove said itrsquos not something that we would look to introduce.\"And earlier this week, Wales health minister Eluned Morgan said such rules were\"not something the Welsh Government has considered\".While health is devolved in Wales, policies regarding vaccines have remained largely the same across the four UK nations, led by common advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation .However, England has taken the additional step of making vaccines mandatory for health and social care workersndash a measure which hasnt been introduced here in Wales. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

He completely stripped down, repaired, and repainted the original wood and metal employing the skills of craftsmen such as signwriter   restorer Mark Stead and wheelwright Cecil Watson. Where replacement was necessary, he sourced only authentic materials. Whilst in the restoration process, a museum stated that they estimated therewere only five remaining in the United Kingdom. It is estimated that this number has decreased still further since then.The wagon was transported to Bray, Co Wicklow in  where it had a starring role in the feature film of Charles Dickens’ ‘The Old Curiosity Shop’.Wilsons’ Plant, Machinery and Commercial Manager Richard McFetridge said: “I am delighted Wilsons Auctions have been entrusted to auction off such a special, historical asset.

Though perhaps keeping your articial one for nine years or more may be just as environmentally friendly.“Save on paper waste by sending an e-card online. An estimated  billion Christmas cards – the equivalent of  million trees - end up in the recycling bin each Christmas,” said a Council spokesperson.“If you need to gt-wrap, avoid glitter and plastic wrap. Why not make your own wrapping paper out of newspaper, brown paper or even a scarf! In the UK , miles of wrapping paper is used at Christmas.“Buy local for your Christmas dinner and gts. This not only supports your local shops and economy but it also cuts down on transport emissions. Buy gts which your family and friends would love such as membership of magazines, tickets to cinema or theatre or vouchers to their favourite restaurant.“Plan your menu ahead and use up those leftovers! Need recipe ideas  Log onto www.lovefoodhatewaste to save money and the environment.“Switch to LED lights. LED’s consume % less energy than twinkling incandescent lights. If you have any outdoor Christmas lights or decorations switch to solar powered and set them on a timer so you don’t waste any precious power. “Buy rechargeable batteries, they will last for years to come! A staggering  million batteries are used over the Christmas period!“Avoid single use plastic - Buy products which are made from compostable or recyclable materials.

The consultation with key stakeholders will run for a period of  weeks.”The issue first arose inFebruary  when the council received a request from Abbeyville Residents’ Association for five Irish language street signs which was turned down after councillors voted in favour of a policy retaining street signs in English only proposed by Glengormley DUP councillor Alderman Phillip Brett and seconded by Glengormley Ulster Unionist councillor Ald Mark Cisgrove.Ald Brett stressed the importance of the council having a policy on the issue so thatthere were future requests, these could be dealt with “smoothly”.Ald Cosgrove said that given the facts and figures presented to members over the number of Irish language speakers in the borough, the request would be “preposterous” and street signs would look like a “dog’s dinner”.According to the  census,.% of residents in Antrim and Newtownabbey had some knowledge of Irish. In , it was reported that  people in Antrim and Newtownabbey spoke Irish as a main language.However, in September , the council was forced to do a u-turn after being challenged in the High Court by a resident who sought a judicial review over a “deeply held concern that the policy adopted by the local authority was unlawful”. Read hereThe borough councilinsisted that its policy was “not a ban in any way on the Irish language” and a new, “more detailed policy would be drafted for the council to consider”.Commenting on last week’s decision, SDLP group leader Councillor Roisin Lynch said: “I was disappointed that councillors decided to support this deeply restrictive policy. It is a shameless and deliberate attempt to slow down and stymy efforts for dual language signage.“There can be little doubt that this onerous policy is designed to obstruct efforts to progress the visibility of Gaeilge in our local communities. I am particularly disappointed that Alliance Party councillors backed a policy designed to restrict the growth of the language.“It is of vital importance that the Irish language is given the visibility it deserves and that anyone who wishes to see bilingual signage in their area has access to a fair and transparent process. This is a slap in the face to those in our communities, including myself, who know that we need to break down barriers to the visibility of the the Irish language, not create new ones.”Antrim and Newtownabbey Mayor Councillor Billy Webb commented: “This is not an Irish language policy. This is a multi-lingual policy. We are a erse community.“The policy is going out to consultation. We were looking for one third of residents of a street to instigate an application and then  per cent plus one in the actual vote. That is a normal and true democratic process. The DUP was looking for two-thirds.”Michelle Weir, Local Democracy Reporter--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this article.
