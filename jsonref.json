At the same time, the volume of disinformation from doctored photos to false rumours and hoax videos spreading online has grown at a worrying pace.In etymological terms, the word “viral” comes from the stem word “virus”. And the viral misinformation can be a danger in itself. Just think of the recent petrol bomb attacks on 5G phone masts because of a widely believed – but unfounded – link to coronavirus.There’s so much noise on social media that false theories are easily spread: whether that’s forwarding an email attachment containing a computer virus without reading it properly, or sharing a faked photo because you’re in a rush.The claim: “5G mobile phone towers emit radiation that attacks the immune system, thus affecting those vulnerable to the coronavirus.”The truth: There is no evidence that 5G weakens immune systems or is harmful to humans, with international radiation experts reminding us that Covid-19 has spread in many countries that don’t have the high-speed phone system, such as Iran. The cause of the disease is still unknown, but appears to have started in a Wuhan food market where wild animals were illegally traded.See also: Other false claims about the causes of coronavirus, such as eating bat soup a manmade bioweapon for population control and fortune cookies.If in doubt ... Don’t trust information on social media if you don’t know where it came from one video claimed new £20 notes show symbols of 5G towers, and dozens of phone masts have been vandalised, including one serving Birmingham’s NHS Nightingale hospital. If a cause is confirmed, it’ll appear in reports issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). Rather than trusting celebrities or influencers, try Googling the information to see whether trusted sources such as reputable news organisations like the BBC or the  have reported it.The claim: “Gargling water mixed with salt or vinegar can wipe out coronavirus.” Or so a post shared many times on email and WhatsApp tells us, often accompanied with information that “holding your breath for 10 seconds can prove there’s no fibrosis in the lungs”.The truth: At present there is no cure or treatment for Covid-19.See also: Bogus claims that coronavirus can be cured or prevented by: oregano oil, lemon juice, sunbathing, using vodka as hand sanitiser, or drinking bleach.If in doubt ... Check the latest advice on the NHS website, the WHO website or the Q\u0026ampA page on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.The claim: In March, a photo emerged on social media purporting to show troops clad in army fatigues walking around London’s Clapham Junction. Many wrongly interpreted this as evidence that the military had been deployed to ensure people stayed home.The truth: The “soldiers” were actually students at a nearby military preparation college and had nothing to do with Covid-19, something confirmed by the Ministry of Defence and the college.See also: Other fabricated photos and videos, such as footage of a man in Wales wiping his hands on a public lift (actually filmed in Bangkok), or the picture of worshippers crowded outside a mosque (taken before lockdown, 23 March).If in doubt: Remember that many doctored photos and videos, plus images with misleading captions, exist online. You can trace the possible source of the photo with a simple image search online.What’s happening: Despite global demand for face masks, a quick online search reveals vendors apparently offering to sell protective gear in bulk.The truth: Hundreds of bogus websites have been set up by criminals since the crisis began, many claiming to have face masks for sale. Police recently revealed British firms and iniduals have lost more than £1.86m to coronavirus-related fraud from bogus companies with no intention of selling masks.See also: The websites recently caught selling fake hand sanitisers or unregistered coronavirus testing kits - another scam.If in doubt ... Never purchase anything from an unverified website - check the padlock symbol in the address bar that indicates a secure connection and report any misleading websites, emails or text messages you think may be suspicious.The claim: “The government has been sending texts alerting people that they’ve been fined for ignoring social distancing measures during lockdown.” For example, one text reads: “You have been out of your house three times today, you are in breach of government guidelines. Your £30 fine will automatically be added to your bill.” A link leads to a non-governmental website asking for bank details.The truth: Hackers have spied an opportunity in the many people working from home, attempting to access their networks or steal login and password details. Up to 21 April, Action Fraud had received more than 1,000 coronavirus- related reports, with losses topping £2.3m.See also: Any email that asks you for personal information such as passwords or credit card details.If in doubt ... Never click on a link in the email or attachment, and refuse any request for money or details. Scan any suspicious text or email for clues.

It’s a scary time – but we must fight for ersityIn March, when my sister in California said she thought strangers were giving her dirty looks for being Chinese, I said she was probably imagining it. Why? Because being a racial minority entails constantly triple-checking whether every micro-aggression was in fact racially motivated, or if you’re being paranoid. I try not to “make everything about racism” because when all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail. But mostly I believe that thoughts lead to feelings, and feelings lead to actions, and sometimes I need to subscribe to fictions of safety to conspire a way to leave the house. Until the paranoia turns real, and the violence comes knocking.Anti-Asian hate crimes are on the rise. In New York, a woman punched an Asian woman on the street, possibly dislocating her jaw, after shouting “You’ve got coronavirus!” In Texas, a man cut and stabbed a Burmese American family of four at a Sam’s Club, slashing one of their two sons from the back of his ear to his eye. One day, I’ll hear Trump insist on calling the coronavirus “the Chinese virus”, and on another, I’ll read the Chinese American writer Jiayang Fan report hearing a man call her a “Chinese bitch” while she was taking out the trash. At some point between the two, I stop thinking my sister was imagining dirty looks, and I think twice about whether or not I should take walks with earbuds in. “I wasn’t offended,” writes Fan. “I was afraid.”An instinct towards fear before offense betrays a kind of racial pragmatism that I’m familiar with. I am not used to asserting pride in my race. I’m more likely to lay aside my ego and try to avoid conflict out of self-preservation. To ignore racism means to think like a white person, and if you think like a white person you might be able to live as one – so goes the myth of the model minority, which my mother subscribed to, when taking me as a child to the LA Philharmonic or the Huntington Library so that I could be schooled in western art.When I see a petition circulating to ban wet markets, however, I can’t help but take it as a personal accusation. As if to say: no matter how high you rise in the world, this is still the savagery you come from. While I was born in America, the wet markets were part of my mother’s daily life growing up in the slums of Hong Kong. I only visited the Hong Kong wet markets once, in 2013, and remember live chickens in cages, about to be beheaded. Whole pigs dangled from hooks in market stall roofs, strung with light bulbs. The briny smell of fish stacked like bricks, and concrete floors dark with watered blood repulsed and thrilled me. Vendors shouted at me in Cantonese, a language I can’t speak, so instead I trailed after my uncle as I felt cocooned by sweaty bodies. Here, the agony between life and death was made palpable with a ravenous urgency I found masculine and barbaric. But this is where I come from. No matter where I end up.I am not for or against banning wet markets, but it is possible to feel proud of a culture you don’t entirely approve of. For most of my life, I have been ambivalent about feeling proud of the coincidence of identities my family assigned me at birth. Though the pride I’m called to now isn’t about self-esteem located in some syrupy interior, but a moral act, for my sake as well as others. As the French sociologist Didier Eribon writes, “pride” – in his case, pride in being gay – “is political through and through because it defies the deepest workings of normality and of normativity.” Our neoliberal culture likes to promote certain notions of “normality” and with it the idea that populations – ethnicities, social classes, sexual minorities – automatically self-purify towards a greater good. To combat that lie requires the ersity that enlists pride in oneself and the other.When, as early as late January, Rome’s Saint Cecilia Conservatory suspended “oriental” students from taking classes, even if they’d never been to China, the Chinese philosopher Yuk Hui denounced the actions as “conducted out of fear, but more fundamentally out of ignorance”. Hui goes on to say that suspending Asian students might be characterized as “immunological”. But expelling Chinese people will not somehow expel the coronavirus. While the latter may never be possible, the former certainly is, as the history of the Chinese Exclusion Act darkly shows. We aren’t choosing between the safety of Asians and the safety of a dominant population. We can have a safe and erse population. And the ersity worth fighting for is a reach towards justice, and a stand against the violence that endangers it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94c1d6f62dbb7d7126aef229e6aa323d9f6e3f49/0_253_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cccf0bb76f39323b175efd56a02ac196","title":"renters evicted june tories pledge coronavirus landlords","story":"The coronavirus-related freeze on evictions is ending – and the new ‘pre-action protocol’ relies on the kindness of landlordsWhen the lockdown ends what will happen to tenants? Almost nine million households, more than a third of all families in Britain, rent from a private landlord, a council or a housing association.Because of coronavirus, many are now in financial need. Nearly two million claims for universal credit have been made since lockdown measures were announced in the UK. Welfare claimants are entitled to payments equivalent to housing benefit. But, as a result of changes made to benefits over the last decade (like the bedroom tax and restrictions to local housing allowance), it is increasingly rare for housing benefit to pay all of a tenant’s rent.Others, although ineligible for universal credit, are also in difficulty: because they have received a redundancy cheque that will soon be spent, or their self-employed grant hasn’t arrived yet. Then there are furloughed workers, paid now, but waiting for news of redundancies from their employer.Right now, all possession hearings – the main step in evicting a tenant – are “stayed”. This is the legal equivalent of putting food in a freezer. The cases are still there, ready to be thawed out at any moment.Where a tenant is behind with their rent, landlords can issue them with a notice instructing them to leave, but (for the moment) the tenant can ignore it. On 25 June the housing courts will reopen for business. Judges will have to determine thousands of stayed pre-coronavirus cases, and the even greater number of new claims for possession arising from the lockdown.Ministers have grasped that hundreds of thousands of homes are at risk. Earlier this week the housing minister, Robert Jenrick, announced that the government was working closely with judges to draft a “pre-action protocol” for when the stay is lifted.He told MPs that the protocol will “enable tenants to have an added degree of protection, because instead of embarking upon the eviction proceedings immediately, there will be a duty upon their landlords to reach out to them, discuss their situation, and try to find an affordable repayment plan”.The problem with the protocol is that it is toothless – essentially depending on the benevolence of landlords.The two most common ways landlords seek possession are under “section 21” and “ground 8”. Section 21 provides that where a landlord has complied with certain procedural requirements (like issuing a notice using the correct form and waiting for a prescribed time before applying to court) the court must order possession.The statute does not require a landlord to have complied with the government’s proposed pre-action protocol. For that reason, even where landlords have rushed to issue proceedings, and have ignored requests from tenants to defer payments for a short time, judges will be required to approve evictions.Ground 8 provides that where a tenant is in rent arrears (eight weeks if the rent is due weekly), both when the landlord serves a notice on them and when the hearing takes place, the court must order possession.Again, the court takes no account of the landlord’s conduct it focuses simply on the amount of the tenant’s arrears. In these circumstances, if the new protocol is as the minister describes it, it will not protect tenants at all.There are alternatives. In last year’s general election, the Conservatives committed to abolish section 21 as part of their “better deal for renters”. The government reaffirmed that commitment in the Queen’s speech, announcing a renters’ reform bill to include the abolition of section 21. They should be held to that promise. As for ground 8, it too needs to be abolished. Or, if that is impossible, rescinded for such time until tenants have had a chance to reduce their debts once they’re able to go back to work.Abolishing or rescinding ground 8 would not prevent landlords relying on other grounds of possession. But, without it in place, judges will be free to order possession only if reasonable – thereby giving effect to the tenant defences the government says that it wants in place. One further advantage of abolishing ground 8 is that courts can turn to other possession proceedings in which possession orders are made but suspended, while tenants are given the chance to repay arrears to a realistic plan. Muddling on without the abolition of section 21 and ground 8 will lead to millions of people forced out of their homes. It will send those evicted scattering – some to stay with elderly relatives, some into local authority housing (although it is at breaking point) and many into homelessness.The government accepts that street homelessness speeds the transmission of coronavirus: this is the grim calculation that underpins the government’s granting of resources to councils to house rough sleepers. Drifting into a future where huge numbers of people lose their homes needlessly would be just as dangerous – for those who are evicted, and for everyone else.• David Renton is a housing barrister at Garden Court Chambers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f7bf1ff54f6a6a6e0a6037f57cde65a269b23b5/0_614_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0d14c18747efa78876e16bfb35b11ce","title":"ve day coronavirus 1945","story":"I remember the euphoria of 8 May 1945, and the push for a fairer society that followed. The parallels today are strikingThe world I grew up in was always circumscribed by war: I was five years old when it began, and it was all I knew. There were lots of rules. The world was black – no chinks of light from curtains, or someone would come knocking no street lights, shop windows, tiny hand torches to find your way. Just total blackness, so the bombers wouldn’t see.They came anyway, lighting up the sky as our nearest city, Manchester, burned. We would huddle safe in our underground shelter, grabbed from my bed in the dark by my father, nestled among soil and spiders. As I grew older we played hiding from Germans in the wheatfields, and swapped pieces of fallen shrapnel. We were aware of mysterious worried chatter among the grownups. My father’s Home Guard rifle stood in the hall.Then suddenly, in May 1945, there was this explosion of light: brightness was everywhere. And excitement, laughter, joy. Everything was allowed. “It” was over. Even our teachers relaxed, laughing too. The great deadly cloud of threat lifted. We knew from the song that, “Somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue, and the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true”. And they had. It was our Over the Rainbow moment.From my village, Hazel Grove, south of industrial, smoky Stockport, the clanging tram would take me to school and back every day. But VE Day was different: a corporation tram was decked out with lights on every surface, glittering like Cinderella’s coach. As the evening darkened it came rattling down the track, through cheering crowds. At the terminal we were all gathered: families, shopkeepers, teachers, doctors. Even the vicar.For the first time I was allowed to gallivant off with friends. Suddenly all the young people joined hands, circling the now stationary tram, and skipped and danced round it into the night. Yes, the world would never be the same again: a future without war, without bombing, rationing, fear, damage, death. Today, 75 years later, I ask myself: will it be like this when the coronavirus is defeated? Our release, when it comes, will be slow, conducted out of sight by scientists, measured and sometimes clumsy. But though we can’t expect that instant euphoria, there are larger parallels.The war taught us many things: fellow feeling, shared values, resourcefulness. People grew their own fruit and veg, kept chickens. Of course, there was a black market petty crime increased, and the rich dined at the Dorchester. The rest of us took our ration books when we went on holiday. But we knew it would end, and the world would be changed.Above all, we appreciated the power of the state to organise for the benefit of everyone: even the royal family was said to limit their bath water to 5 inches deep – a requirement instinctively obeyed by us all, even if unpoliced. A vast infrastructure of recruitment, to the services and factories, the commandeering of transport on roads and ports, was all part of the war effort. “Don’t you know there’s a war on?” was a good-humoured response to anyone complaining.But something else was afoot. The years before the war had seen the Great Depression and suffering among working people. Today we acknowledge the damage the recent years of austerity did to the lives of the poorest, and in that sense to us all. With both the war and the pandemic has come the resolve, hardly formulated today but widely shared, that we can’t go back to the old ways. There is a drive to make things better.During the war, improvements were already being mapped out: in 1942, William Beveridge (a Liberal) published a report attacking what he called the five giants: idleness, ignorance, disease, squalor and want. He first used the phrase “from cradle to grave” to describe universal provision, and his study would be a blueprint for the postwar welfare state.In 1944 Rab Butler ( a Tory) saw through the Education Act, which completely transformed schooling in Britain by abolishing fees for all state secondary education. It also introduced the 11-plus exam, splitting educational options: I, the granddaughter of factory workers, passed, and went to a grammar school. This was all happening even as we battled the enemy in the Mediterranean and Normandy. It was based on creating a more equitable society, and there was a wide consensus this should be so. It translated into a Tory defeat in the 1945 general election. Churchill was shocked: hadn’t he won the war for us? But change was pressing forward.Will change on a similar scale come to us in the coming years? Who is doing the planning right now? Who is setting out the blueprint for a fairer society?The ever growing disparity of wealth – between iniduals, between countries – is probably the major blight of our present world order. It is, like Covid-19, a global issue. In confronting the one, as we already are doing, we could also seize the chance to confront the other. It is an opportunity that may not come again.• Joan Bakewell is a broadcaster, writer and Labour peer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91f425cedbd8a55b9a509d8ee6523a95aaf54b80/0_113_4549_2730/master/4549.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29f0d6e740e9dbc710143d67ccb563e6","title":"finding sanctuary in nature during lockdown","story":"Determined to find an uplifting moment every day, the Yorkshire photographer Rebecca Cole has been in search of images that bring spring to her family and friends in lockdown. She has been sharing a daily image with them via Blipfoto for the last six and a half years, but photographing nature has provided a particularly welcome escape in recent weeksCutting short our holiday to Cuba as Covid-19 took off, it was an eerie feeling transferring through an emptying Paris Charles de Gaulle airport in the middle of the day with the shutters down on duty free. I wasn’t sure what to expect when we got home but, while life felt uncertain, I knew my wildlife - my haven - would still be there. The countryside around Burley-in-Wharfedale, my home, has become my daily sanctuary, now more than ever.One stick, five gates. Living in a village, we have the luxury of the countryside on our doorstep, but with it, comes the challenge of multiple gates, now being handled by multiple people. A carefully chosen single-outing stick is doing the trick nicely for every type of opening.Walking much closer to home and for less time, I’ve been worried that I wouldn’t be able to find my moment with nature anymore, but something always turns up. Here a tawny mining bee fell out of a tree in front of my lens 300 metres from home.I’m finding moments arriving as if on cue, just when I need them the most. The last time I saw a brimstone butterfly was 2017, so imagine my delight at spotting this one glaring at me in the sunshine in front of a deep gorse dell.Normally I just enjoy happening on butterflies as the season warms up, but this year I’ve taken utmost pleasure from looking out for which one is due to emerge next - from the hibernating overwintering adults to the first to emerge fresh from their pupae. The green hairstreak is a local favourite of mine - surprisingly easy to miss!Even this elusive chiffchaff seemed willing to be on film. Perhaps having recently arrived and being hungry, this one was less cautious about being captured as it picked off tiny bugs from budding trees.I call this one “crouching toad, hidden dog”. Our dog can’t walk as far as she used to, but I managed to time one of my few walks up onto the moors since lockdown perfectly for the day the toads got active. Perhaps the out-take should have been my record as one clambered onto my glasses when I took a moment to read the settings on my camera.It seemed trivial to be photographing a bee on the day after it was announced that Boris Johnson was in hospital with coronavirus, but I’ve concluded that everyone has to hang on to their sanity in their own way.In Yorkshire we can’t have been luckier with the weather recently. We’ve had the luxury of days on end of blue skies and the birds have been making the most of it too.It’s been the colours and the shapes of nature as well as the expressions of wildlife that have given me a daily smile in these uncertain times. In particular, I’m finding the spring colours of lemons and limes giving me a real boost. This willow warbler taken through gorse is my recent favourite. Wildlife has always been and will continue to be my sanctuary.Over time, I’ve found a few local nooks and crannies to keep an eye on at different times of the year. This is one of them in a beautiful woodland back garden I walk past.

Startling images have come from India where, for the first time in a generation, the Himalayas have been visible more than a hundred miles away. Something similar happened in the UK in 1921 when coal shortages during a miner’s strike led to newspaper reports of distant landmarks being visible as never before. In the UK we too have been able to look up at clearer blue skies, less impeded by air pollution and not crisscrossed by aircraft contrails. This helped Germany to break a solar power record.In Beijing, air pollution controls for the 2014 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting also brought a return to blue skies. The term “APEC blue” emerged in Chinese social media and was nominated as Beijing’s top environmental phrase for the year. Later it took on a tinge of sadness, to mean something wonderful, but brief.

Some may have to be abandoned altogether as they cannot be defended,” said co-author Stefan Rahmstorf, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.In the worst-case scenario – with rising emissions and global heating of 4.5C above pre-industrial levels – the study estimates the surface of the world’s oceans in 2100 will be between 0.6 and 1.3 metres higher than today, which would potentially engulf areas  home to hundreds of millions of people.By contrast, if humanity succeeds in cutting carbon dioxide and holding the increase in temperature to 2C, the rise would be a more manageable 0.5 metre.The figures for both pathways are more pessimistic than those outlined by the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC), which predicts the worst possibility is a 1.1-metre rise by 2100.The gap reflects advances in climate science and differences in approach. The IPCC works largely through consensus among scientific working groups, which tends to produce relatively conservative estimates.By contrast, the new survey – published in the journal Climate and Atmospheric Science – aggregates the views of 106 specialists, who were chosen because they have published at least six peer-reviewed papers on the subject in major academic journals. As a result, the predictions are more representative of a range of views in the field.The higher estimates highlight growing concern about the world’s two biggest ice sheets, in Antarctica and Greenland. Satellite data and on-the-ground measurements show these regions are melting faster than most computer models predicted. Many of the scientists said there was now greater understanding of the risks posed by marine ice-cliff instability, which can lead to the collapse of ice shelves.The study was led by scientists at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore with support from seven research institutions across the world, including Durham University in the UK, Tufts University in the US and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.The lead author, Prof Benjamin Horton of the university’s Asian School of the Environment, said the research aimed to condense the growing mass of academic studies about sea-level projections into a simple overview. “It is useful to survey leading experts on the expected sea-level rise, which provides a broader picture of future scenarios and informs policymakers so they can prepare necessary measures,” he said.The authors said the results showed how much warming – and sea-level rise – could be avoided if governments fulfilled their 2015 Paris climate agreement promises to cut emissions of the gases that are heating the planet. Most countries are far off reaching their goals.“Like in the Covid pandemic, timing is critical to prevent devastation. If you wait until you already have a serious problem, then it is too late. Unlike with corona, sea-level rise cannot be stopped for many centuries or even millennia once ice sheets have been destabilised past their tipping points,” Rahmstorf said.But, without deeper structural changes, the reduction is likely to be temporary and will make little difference to the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The Met Office predicted on Thursday carbon dioxide measurements at the Mauna Loa measuring station would rise 2.5 parts per million this year.“Although emissions are reducing this year, this does not mean the build-up of CO2 in the atmosphere will reverse – it will just be slightly slower” the Met Office’s chief CO2 forecaster, Richard Betts, said in a blogpost.“An analogy is filling a bath from a tap – it’s like we are turning down the tap, but because we are not turning off the tap completely, the water level is still rising.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47b319cc28d26d29081de384617889625acef68d/0_649_2667_1600/master/2667.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d32c1303cdfacf383f5b151d50207ee0","title":"how to dress in lockdown jess cartner morley","story":"The latest trends may not matter any more, but there is a whole new set of influences on what we wearI know, I know – there are more important things to think about than clothes at the moment. I get that. On the other hand, I don’t see that me squinting at graphs or scrolling through headlines is going to make a vaccine come any quicker. So thinking about clothes is no less constructive than pondering logarithmic scales or contact tracing approaches, really.I have pretty much checked out of fashion, in the sense of trends, during the period universally known as This Difficult Time. For those of us fortunate enough not to be at the sharp end of the crisis, lockdown is a little like living in a freeze-frame, and the “spring trends” that were scheduled to be happening in our wardrobes now – Bermuda shorts, crochet dresses, waistcoats – feel like outfits for a party that got cancelled. Fashion in the this-week’s-must-have sense feels like a radio station that’s still broadcasting, but with no one tuning in.But I think about clothes as much as ever, because there are an entirely new set of rules to navigate. For instance: right now, we are much more likely to be looked down upon for going out in public looking dressed up, than we are for going out in public looking scruffy. To avoid glares of disapproval, you need to either be in exercise gear or supermarket-appropriate utilitarian get-up. If you have a dog, you can wear your dog-walking jacket, but be careful only to be seen in it once a day, otherwise someone might report you. Leaving the house wearing anything that suggests fun or glamour is now deeply suspicious – although full hair, makeup and heels are permissible for Thursdays between 8pm and 8.05pm, now that The Clapping has become established as the key emotional and social moment of our calendars.At home, the novelty of working in tracksuit bottoms wore off a while ago. I don’t like the way joggers develop a knobbly kneed silhouette when you sit down in them for more than half an hour, and without wanting to sound like Karl Lagerfeld, an elasticated waist doesn’t speak to the We’ve Got This mood music of the hour. Hence these faux-leather trousers. Comfortable enough to sit on my very non-ergonomic kitchen chair all day, but dressy enough to feel like I’m repping the public-facing version of myself, at least up until the time I snap the laptop shut. Trends don’t matter right now. But feeling like you’ve got your act together? That’s everything."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbb3496eed659477abb4d7978db61263a4bf13ee/0_245_3479_2089/master/3479.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9872c36a7370f5f828d17c45fe83cf2b","title":"its a mistresspiece the 14 hour film about forgotten female directors","story":"Mark Cousins’ latest encyclopedic romp is a glorious enterprise that unearths footage from some of the greatest film-makers ever – all of them womenA perfect lockdown gift has landed, one which might have sounded daunting in ordinary times: a 14-hour documentary about female directors, which goes live from next week on BFI Player. This glorious enterprise unearths footage from some of the greatest movie-makers of this century and the last – all of them female. At the same time, the BFI is showing 36 of the hundreds of films mentioned, so that viewers can enjoy full immersion over weeks, possibly awarding themselves a degree in, say, The Cinema of the Second Sex afterwards.Narrated by women including Tilda Swinton and Thandie Newton, Women Make Film – A New Road Movie Through Cinema is the latest encyclopedic romp from the Northern Irish film historian and documentary-maker Mark Cousins, who previously directed the 15-hour television series The Story of Film: An Odyssey, in 2011. The new documentary will be released in palatable chunks over five weeks from 18 May, and aims to open a conversation on the lost legacy of women behind the movie camera.The film does not waste time wondering why women have been sidelined by mainstream cinema – we knew the answers to that long before #MeToo. This is not about slamming the patriarchy, but a joyous trip through women’s work on screen, puckishly curated into 40 chapters on different themes including openings, interiority, meet cutes, sci-fi, tone, love, death, editing and musicals. The clips cover six continents, 13 decades and 183 directors, from the studio owner Alice Guy Blaché’s early silent work to the Russian director Kira Muratova, populists Dorothy Arzner and Kathryn Bigelow in the US, and China’s Wang Ping under Mao. Cinephiles previewing at festivals have been gobsmacked by the sheer quality of work excavated from previously obscure film-makers.“For years when I was visiting a country, I’d ask who their great female directors were,” says Cousins, citing his encounter with the 86-year-old Sri Lankan director Sumitra Peries, who was astonished to be contacted. “Yes, we’re interested in her life, but in this film we’re interested in her camera, her images, her social and psychological ideas.”Cousins started thinking about missing female films in the mid-90s when he curated a season of great documentaries, and realised that he had included only one by a woman, Barbara Kopple’s powerful mining story Harlan County, USA (1976). “Afterwards I thought, that’s gunk.” (Gunk is a Northern Irish term meaning “a shock of disappointment”.) Cousins gathered a team at Hopscotch Films in Glasgow to rectify the situation. It began as an unpaid labour of love, years in the making. “I wanted to be an ally with the great female activists who are pushing for change in the film industry today.”Women Make Film is helping spawn a movement to bring this lost archive into the light, reminding older feminists of the days when the green spines of Virago books rescued early writers from obscurity and changed the literary canon. The charity Birds’ Eye View, which promotes female-made films, will launch an extension of its #ReclaimTheFrame scheme, which previously ran in cinemas countrywide.Under lockdown #ReclaimTheFrame will attempt to #ReclaimTheCanon, hosting weekly home “viewing parties” for each section of Cousins’ documentary, with Facebook Live responses from women filmmakers and debates afterwards. Birds’ Eye View’s director, Mia Bays, says: “This is the best possible primer for a conversation which will have film-makers talking about who they love, and their new discoveries, and also about how cinema is controlled: who decides what’s shown, what’s archived, what’s digitised for a new audience.”Birds’ Eye View has been working with the doyenne of feminist cinema, Prof Laura Mulvey of Birkbeck University, famed for creating the term “the male gaze”. At 78 years old, she is taking to Facebook Live debates with alacrity. Cousins cites as one of his inspirations the first Women’s Film Event at the Edinburgh film festival in 1972, which was curated by Mulvey and others. As their blurb then said: “A festival of men’s films would be simply absurd. It’s because so few women have been able to make films that this festival exists.”Mulvey is delighted that her work is being continued. “With this new compilation, an exciting staging post has been reached in the long process of recovery,” she says. “The amazing extent of the work, with over a thousand clips, has the potential to bring women directors out of gender categorisation and into film history as such. But it also offers an unprecedented opportunity to enjoy women’s cinematic vision and reflect on the way women have seen and indeed made the world through film – a source of wonder and of speculation!”Even those immersed in female film, such as Bays, have been surprised by the archival finds, such as Germany Pale Mother (1980) by Helma Sanders-Brahms, which is also on BFI Player. “It’s the best film about war I’ve seen, a remarkable work. A mistresspiece!”The documentary is also a resource for film schools wishing to explore horizons beyond the Scorsese-Tarkovsky-Fellini triangle. Cousins has already heard from universities who want to use his film, and he hopes even more material will emerge. “We have to ask, what do we not know? The old canon was a kind of comfort blanket which we need to throw off.”Women Make Film has sold around the world to mainstream television broadcasters from the US to China to Spain – but not yet in the UK, although BBC Four has declared an interest. “Maybe we’re having an intellectual and cultural lockdown, post-Brexit, as well as a physical lockdown,” laughs Cousins. But despite losing a cinema release, he points with hope to the “sense of community in lockdown, the sense of something bigger. People are looking for a bit of structure in their lives, something affirmative.”Women Make Film launches on the BFI Player and Blu-ray on 18 May. It will be available later in May on Curzon Home Cinema and Amazon Prime Video"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f8194b6d65f8aeba129d063a67f206555907e51/544_399_4742_2845/master/4742.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc848d9f14098c0e87aae1939166d82b","title":"anna jones recipe lemon drizzle layer cake and other jammy ideas","story":"Jam is a handy fallback when fruit is in short supply, be that in an eggless cake, or as an accompaniment for cheese, pancakes, granola and more ...Whenever I visit my parents, I bring them a jar of jam. It’s taken until now (we are staying with them) to realise that they eat only marmalade, so we have an accidental stockpile. A convenient one, too as we’re shopping less frequently, our fresh fruit supply is limited, and jam makes a good – if rather sweet – substitute. Used sparingly, and mixed with a little lemon juice, jam steps in for cooked fruit in bakes, breakfasts, pancakes, puddings and as a sidekick for cheese. This layer cake takes the best bits from a victoria sponge and a lemon drizzle, while these five quick ideas for new ways to use the jam in the cupboard.This is easy as anything: egg-free cake is made from things that I expect most of you have in your cupboards. I’ve tried to keep the recipe as flexible as possible, so use whichever sugar, flour, jam and citrus you have around. You will need two 20cm round cake tins.350g plain or spelt flour250g sugar (caster is best, granulated or light brown also work)2 tsp baking powderA pinch of salt350ml milk of your choice (I used oat)120ml flavourless oil (such as vegetable, sunflower, light olive, coconut)2 unwaxed lemons or limes, zested and juiced (about 8 tbsp)For the yoghurt-jam filling4 tbsp thick yoghurt (thick coconut or Greek) or cream cheese4 tbsp icing sugar4 tbsp jam of your choice (I used apricot)For the drizzle syrup2 tbsp sugarGrease both cake tins and line the base with discs of baking paper. If you don’t have baking paper, grease the tin, add a tablespoon of sugar, then tip the tin and shake it around to cover the surface, shaking off any excess.Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4. In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt with a whisk.In another bowl, whisk the milk, oil and half the citrus juice. Add the wet ingredients to the dry and mix well with a wooden spoon.Add the zest from the citrus fruit. Beat well, until the ingredients are thoroughly combined and the mixture is smooth.Spoon the cake mix evenly between the lined tins, spread to level it out with the back of a spoon, and bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 30-40 minutes. Transfer to a rack and leave to cool completely before removing from the tin.Meanwhile, make the drizzle syrup, combining three tablespoons of the remaining juice with the sugar, then carefully and evenly spoon it over the top of just one of the cakes – this will be the topping.Once the cakes are cool, make the filling. Combine the yoghurt and icing sugar, and mix the jam with a tablespoon of lemon juice. Put the bottom cake on a plate, spread over the filling, dot with the jam, then make sandwich with the sugared cake on top.Let it down with lemon, orange or lime juice for a spoonable compote to top your morning granola or porridge if you have run out of fresh fruit.My friend, the food writer Georgie Hayden, rightly points out that apricot jam is a perfect pairing for halloumi. Warm it with a little lemon juice and spread it on top of crisp, fried or grilled halloumi.Goat’s cheese, feta and soft, rinded cheese such as brie make a great partner for some jams – sharper ones, such as blackcurrant or blackberry, work best.Any jam warmed in a pan with a little citrus juice or water makes a great quick topping for most pancakes and puddings.Sandwich a cake, as in today’s first recipe, or some cookies with it – or bake it into these delicious crumble bars."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/786251f27f49e78b7a937e4b5ef3ae5347257861/0_169_5067_3040/master/5067.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f501a1eefde51256206f7c707d10bea","title":"if god wanted me to be a size eight would he have made birds eye potato waffles so waffly versatile grace dent food","story":"‘Being locked away has permitted many of us to eat without the annual creeping tyranny of how we should look in time for summer’Although many Brits stampeded into the supermarkets in late March, in the fear that we were going to starve due to food shortages, by May some of us have found that the opposite is the case. Pulling, or rather heaving, on my Lycra this week, I noted that, in profile, I resembled a snugly stuffed Cumberland sausage, perhaps because my lockdown stash of “delicious things bought to sit out dystopia” – Choco Leibniz biscuits, Doritos, Super Noodles, tinned macaroni cheese – is now somewhat depleted. I’ve observed the government’s Stay At Home mantra obediently, with a mere 160 steps in 24 hours being my personal best so far. Not one single, non-essential journey did I make that day, other than a mooch to the kitchen to graze subliminally on delicious, non-perishable items that I’d bought to see me through the end of the world. Dystopia, I reckoned, calls for stuff you can eat with one hand while sat on your roof waving to the army to pick you up. That’s why I had, albeit temporarily, an eight-pack of Mini Cheddars.Dystopia, however, did not come. Or at least not how I’d envisioned it. In its place there’s a relentless drip of disconcerting news: redundancies, recession and, of course, the endless dying. Matt Hancock’s press briefings, I’ve found, go well with small mug of Baileys and perhaps a finger or two of Highland shortbread. And during week five, when I stopped replying to WhatsApp messages because I had run out of words to say, I ate no actual meals at all. Just lots of semi-pacifying things: fistfuls of Kellogg’s Krave straight out of the packet, the last of the marzipan Christmas tree decorations… Subliminal grazing. Life is short, so have a KitKat. The feeling of my thumbnail sliding through the silver paper was ever so comforting.And now all of this is dispersed lavishly around my hips and bottom. And not for the first time, either – in fact, probably for at least the 30th time, because I have been losing and gaining the same 10 pounds since I was 14, back when I first noted the life-shattering discrepancy between my own arms in a spaghetti-strap cocktail frock and Béatrice Dalle’s. I know the drill, and I know how to lose it: walk more, eat fresh things, go to bed hungry, no day drinking, yadda bloody yadda. And I know, of course, that those pounds I melt off will be back before Christmas. It is my destiny. If God wanted me to be a size eight, would he have made Birds Eye Potato Waffles so waffly versatile? Or toastable in the toaster? Think on that.It feels churlish to mention weight in the middle of this crisis. We know there are more than 30,000 families right now who would love a problem as petty as tight jeans. Still, all week across social media, I’ve read people’s worries about lockdown weight fluctuation – and about loss as well as gain.It feels, roughly speaking, as if being hidden away over springtime has permitted many of us to eat without the annual creeping tyranny of how we should look in time for summer. Wedding invites were cancelled, summer parties scrapped, flights were suspended and, therefore, sod being beach-body ready, frankly. All those forthcoming dates on the calendar that, as we peer into the refrigerator before bedtime, keep us deftly in line. That pair of trousers on the back of the bedroom door, the ones with the button that won’t quite reach, might fit for the christening if we quit bread, wine and takeaways for a month, but now they can be stuffed back in the wardrobe. Silver linings have been fairly thin on the ground during Covid-19, but the right to wear elasticated-waist nightwear in daytime – livening it up with a jaunty scarf during Zoom calls to fool colleagues that you’re dressed – well, at least there was that.But now those days are creeping gently to a close. In the supermarket yesterday – I am brave enough to go there more regularly now – and after finishing my 10,000 steps, I dutifully filled my basket with spinach, carrots, hummus, tofu and buckwheat soba noodles. Health, health, health! I put in some bananas “as a treat”, but just small ones, because they’re ever so carby. I mean, a full-sized banana? Imagine. I bought some of those flavoured rice cakes that seem a good idea at the time, but after approximately three you remember that they taste like small, tortuous, polystyrene Frisbees. I will be abstemious, focused and ready to face the public. I’ll shed the pounds, as usual. But all my old baggage? That I’ll very much regain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f02d99c0c61e788e3b293f24b7c0872233e70252/0_23_2640_1584/master/2640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19d15be356d8504c1772e06c728df81b","title":"world cup questions zinedine zidane head butt 2006 berlin france italy marco materazzi","story":"Using the Fifa archive we rewatch a series of memorable games in search of answers we didn’t find at the time“It was like knocking four quick times on the door of unhappiness” – Albert Camus, the OutsiderThe World Cup final, France v Italy in Berlin’s Olympic Stadium. It’s still humid under the lights. The score is 1-1, the players wide-eyed but still running.A World Cup that began a month ago in Munich is entering the final moments of overtime. Marco Materazzi puts his hand on Zinedine Zidane’s back, seeming to guide him quite gently out of the way. Zidane turns, says something and walks away. He has two minutes and 10 seconds left of his career as a footballer.Everyone knows what happens next. Zidane’s red card is one of the much-storied moments of modern football. We remember it as the decisive turn in a World Cup final as a discordant endnote to a great career and its aftermath as a wider narrative of loyalties, brands, attitudes, even personal politics.It was always part of Zidane’s appeal that he remained to some degree an outsider superstar even in his pomp years. Zidane turned 24 while playing (unremarkably) for France at Euro 96. He’d spent six seasons in Ligue 1, brilliant but brittle, by the time Juventus took a gamble on this silhouette of a football genius.Italy made Zidane. The fitness, the tactical discipline and the influence of Marcello Lippi pushed him right out into the far reaches of his own talent. Sport loves an easy narrative arc. In Berlin it seemed fitting that his final game as a footballer should come with Lippi on the touchline, on a night when Zidane’s expressive, balletic brilliance was matched against a team of definitive Italian defensive resilience.Was this a moment of hubris? Of downfall and fatal flaws? Was Zidane exposed in Berlin? Or ennobled? At times in sport there is a feeling the drive for meaning comes from a kind of desperation. Let’s face it, there really are a lot of people watching here. This has to mean something.Two things stand out now. First, Italy always seemed to be winning this World Cup final from about 20 minutes into the game. France played like a team with an air of destiny around it without actually, it turns out, having an air of destiny. Zidane’s sending off was not material to the drift of this game, to its sense of natural justice. The red card deprived France of a first-choice penalty taker – but correctly so. It also deprived Italy of the chance to win the World Cup final without an asterisk.And secondly Zidane looks wired from the start. The Fifa film is a high-resolution number. As the teams walk out the camera pans to show the wonderful sweep of the stadium, crammed with conflicting shades of blue. These are two of the great national anthems, accompanied by a camera-pan down a thrilling row of row faces.What a team France had. Patrick Vieira stands with eyes closed, an arm around Thierry Henry, who has an arm around a 23-year-old Franck Ribéry. Zidane is at the end of the line, the star of this show already. He was brilliant in the quarter-final against Brazil. In closeup he even looks like the World Cup, that huge sleek rounded skull filling the screen. Even when you know the end note here, the empty clang of forehead into chest, the sense of glory in waiting feels inevitable. Marchons, marchons.The pitch is cut in beautiful wide green stripes. Even the people in the stands seem to gleam with youth and wealth. This really was the most prosperous of modern-day World Cups, a World Cup drenched in Euro boom times, in Germany’s success, in the age of Wags and headline-grabbing haircuts, a cult of celebrity that still felt oddly innocent.Zidane’s first touch is a dinked outside-of-the-foot pass to the left. Seconds later Henry is knocked almost out cold in a collision with Fabio Cannavaro’s shoulder. Smelling salts are produced. With four minutes gone Gianluca Zambrotta is booked for hacking down Vieira as he glides away with the ball. Italy aren’t mucking about.But they’re soon behind. Henry heads the ball inside from the touchline and suddenly Florent Malouda is haring in on goal. Materazzi goes to tackle, then pulls his leg away. Cannavaro stays close but resists making contact. Malouda falls over. It’s a pretty soft penalty kick.Zidane takes the kick. And of course it’s ridiculous. A Panenka penalty in the seventh minute of the World Cup final against one of the best goalkeepers ever to play the game. Who does this?It’s also a poor Panenka, floating on to the bar then bouncing down and just over the line. It’s a goal. But it feels like an embarrassment to the occasion, the act of someone not entirely in control.In the stands Jacques Chirac bounces and yelps. France have held on to a 1-0 lead in their last two games. Italy have now conceded their first goal scored by an actual opponent in this tournament – the only other was Cristian Zaccardo’s own-goal in the group-stage draw against the USA. But they soon start to press back.What have Italy got here? For a start they have Mauro Camoranesi, who wouldn’t get anywhere near the French team, who is a stubby little scuttling pest of a midfielder, but who doesn’t give a damn about any of this, or about the occasion, and just keeps on snapping around Zidane.They have Andrea Pirlo, a sublime talent too, and seemingly always able to execute those skills in these huge games. Pirlo looks calm, buzzing up and down the left, twisting about chipping intricate little passes, asserting his own rhythms. It’s his corner that makes the equaliser, a precise delivery on to the head of Materazzi, who leaps above Vieira and batters the ball past Fabien Barthez, his forehead striking the leather like a fist.The score is 1-1. Italy are just about in charge now. Fabio Grosso gallops down the left and punts a cross over the bar. Grosso isn’t a great left-back. But he had a great World Cup. This is what Italy do, a way of playing that ennobles and vindicates every other team’s victories. You want this? You want your moment in time? Fine. But you’ve got to come through us to get there.Henry has recovered by now. He runs past Francesco Totti and slides Ribéry in on the right. He fends off Gennaro Gattuso with a regal dip of the shoulder. Mention is sometimes made of the fact Henry played in nine cup finals and scored zero goals. A few months earlier he left the pitch raging in Paris after defeat by Barcelona in the Champions League final. There is no significance to this. Henry is an extraordinary footballer and a leader too, driving to the left and setting up the pattern of France’s attacks, with the wide players surging inside and Zidane playing very high at times as a genuine No 10.Italy’s success in this game lies in the way they interrupt this flow. Every time Zidane gets the ball within 40 metres of goal Gattuso charges into his space. Zidane can have the ball in the centre circle. Anywhere else: compress, bite, bring him down. When they have the ball Italy play diagonal long passes to Luca Toni. The plan is clear. Shut Zidane down. Keep possession. Get behind the French full-backs.With 35 minutes gone Toni heads Pirlo’s cross against the bar. Moments later Zidane turns and starts to dribble but Materazzi comes sprinting out and performs an astonishing tackle, taking he ball at full stretch with a deep booming thunk. Zidane gets up. No complaints. But Italy are dominating as half-time arrives.The second half is gripping. Malouda should have another penalty in the 53rd minute after he’s bundled down by Zambrotta. Vieira goes off injured. Toni heads a deep free-kick past Barthez from the edge of the box with thrilling power, but he’s offside.As the game enters the final 10 minutes of normal time Italy are playing through a kind of triumphant rage, defending furiously, keeping the ball, passing it backwards to cheers from their support. Zidane has injured his shoulder. He has it sprayed and wanders back on. He’s still running hard, even if by now his goal feels like it happened in another life.Even the break before extra time seems telling. Lippi is pointing and yelling and bollocking his players. Raymond Domenech takes Zidane to one side and speaks to him quietly. Zidane listens then walks away. Fair enough. What exactly, are you going to tell him here anyway?Ribéry finds space and has a shot at goal. David Trezeguet, scorer of the winner against Italy in the final of Euro 2000, replaces him. Zidane does something brilliant, jinking away from the blue press, then haring into the middle to head Willy Sagnol’s cross. Buffon palms it over. Zidane screams. And then it happens.There are 12 minutes left of extra time. Italy have cleared the ball upfield. Materazzi touches Zidane’s back. It seems like nothing much. Words are spoken. Play continues. Zidane and Materazzi are a few metres apart. Zidane turns, thinks about it. The incident is passing. It’s almost gone. But not quite. Zidane comes closer.It looks like an excellent butt from a technical point of view: shoulders swivelling, neck wrenched, forehead rammed into the breast bone. It’s not exactly “shockingly violent”, as the commentator suggests (Materazzi just gets up) more shockingly weird and out of place.Play continues. But this is too big to pass. It’s a footballing Chernobyl. It can’t be glossed or hushed. The reactor core is open. And the fallout is already starting. Italian players are pointing and haranguing the referee. There are animated conversations, figures scuttling across the pitch.It takes two minutes of earpiece-clutching for a response to come. Zidane is sent off. He puts a hand on the referee’s shoulder, says something, then walks away. On the touchline Domenech performs furious sarcastic applause. Zidane ambles past the trophy. And that is pretty much that.There are still two main mysteries here. First, why did he do it? Zidane suggested afterwards that his mother had been insulted. Some English newspapers even ran a story that Materazzi had called his mother “a terrorist whore”, apparently based on lip reading experts, but then had to apologise, retract and pay libel damages when Materazzi denied it.Is it enough? Does any part of this add up? There has been so much noise, so much temptation to portray Zidane as either a fatally-flawed hero, a defender of personal rights, a human agent in a world of athletic units. Really, though, the main feeling is one of crushing mundanity, of mild absurdity even. Is this really it?The second mystery surrounds the call to send him off. Lippi suggested initially help had come from a Fifa official with a TV monitor. This would have been a breach of protocol. The Fifa line is that the fourth official, Luis Medina Cantalejo of Spain, saw the butt in real time and told referee Horacio Elizondo through his head set.The referee has even given a TED talk on this subject. Apparently Cantalejo told him: “Dreadful, Zidane’s head-butt on Materazzi was dreadful … Fuck! Zidane head-butted Materazzi. When you see the video you will not believe me.” Cantalejo mentions video here, unnecessarily. Conspiracy fans will perhaps wonder why.Does it matter? This was entirely the right decision. Although, it also feels a little odd even now. Football changed in that instant: a moment of progress, but also of intrusion, a moment when professional sport edged closer to becoming an arm of our shared 24-hour digital surveillance.To follow high-level football now is to experience an endless loop, an endless argument about details. Some see this as a triumph, progress towards the elimination of error and perfectibility. This is perhaps the case. But it also forgets the elements of play, of muddle, of intrigue that distinguish “sport” (look up that word) from data, from a line of numbers, from a courtroom transcript, from drudgery, from an absence of human mess and human muddle.So to penalties. Pirlo hoists the opening kick in the roof of the net, a kick so decisive you know at this moment Italy are going to win. Materazzi takes one, of course, and scores easily. In fact everyone scores except Trezeguet, who smashes his with pointless power against the crossbar. The ball bounces down and out, a mocking echo of that Panenka. “The BIGGEST SIX INCHES in French football HISTORY,” the Fifa commentator says, admiringly.Italy just keep slotting them. Alessandro Del Piero never looks like missing through every one of the 50 steps it takes to get to the spot. Grosso puts one in the corner. And that is it. The blue shirts come haring on, leaping and jumping, eyes wide, spooked by their own moment of history.In France there was an instant urge to find some kind of meaning in Zidane’s headbutt, not just as a reason for defeat, but as some wider cultural force. “Zizou On T’aime” was scrawled across the Arc de Triomphe. Chirac would announce his love and admiration for Zidane (who lost his temper and butted someone) in a speech on the team’s return. The butt was made into a sculpture (“Coup De Tete”) and displayed at the Centre Pompidou.Some of his teammates were less than pleased. Sagnol didn’t speak to Zidane for two years. And for that team this was a moment when something passed. A World Cup win would have been France’s third major trophy in eight years, a run to enshrine that team with the true greats.Half of the class in 2006 had been there for the whole . In the event that brilliant generation is left with a home World Cup, a Euros in the country next door, the implosion in South Korea and defeat to Greece at Euro 2004: a fine champion team but not quite an all-time great one.Zidane’s sending off brought a feeling of entropy, but also of absurdity, an act pulled out from all that heat and light that seems to mean less the more you look at it.It seems significant that Zidane himself has never appeared to be tortured, or aggrieved, or even that bothered by his final moment as a footballer. What does seem certain is that Italy’s win reasserted in its own way the value of the team in an age in inidualism. And that they were, all white noise aside, entirely deserved winners."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c17130adf1da53812b795d97090efb58a4b08e3/34_29_2495_1497/master/2495.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8573e6f0f8aa5d907e2602d85a2e28cb","title":"football quiz the players who missed out","story":"Not everyone can win everything.

I wasn’t at Wembley, I didn’t watch on TV and I didn’t listen to it on the radio. How, then, I hear you say, can the 1998 FA Cup final between Arsenal and Newcastle possibly be my favourite game?I had always been an Arsenal fan, I didn’t have a choice. I grew up in a council flat in Hackney where if you left the windows open on matchdays you could faintly hear the Highbury goal celebrations. I went to a primary school in Islington. My dad supported Arsenal, so did my grandad.When George Graham’s Arsenal won the league in 1991, I was four. I cannot remember the Graham era, I have vague memories of Bruce Rioch’s sub-50 games. In reality, the 1997-8 season is where football, beyond the playground, began for me.A first league title, that I could remember, ensured I was well and truly a child of Arsène Wenger’s Arsenal. The chance to do the Double for the first time since 1971, when my dad was 10, felt magical. At 11, it was my turn.Except I wasn’t even in London for the final. As Arsenal prepared to field a side without an injured Dennis Bergkamp and a not-quite-fit-to-start Ian Wright, I, in my final year of primary school, was on a coach heading for a week-long trip in Devon.When matchday came, we begged the trio of teachers to let us watch or listen to the game but they refused because it would mess up the day’s schedule. My class of little Gooners had to wait.One of the group, though, had sneaked out a pocket radio. I have no idea where we were going to, or coming from, or where we stopped off during the course of the two hours from kick-off to final whistle, but as a train of schoolchildren weaved along a narrow pavement in the middle of nowhere a stream of Chinese-whisper match updates would trickle down the line.When Emmanuel Petit swept the ball into the path of Marc Overmars, who slotted between the legs of an onrushing Shay Given, an excited murmur filtered down the pairs of kids. We felt exhilarated by our small act of rebellion, and stealthy. Looking back, it’s hard to believe the teachers were not very quickly aware of exactly what was going on, a kind blind eye, perhaps, allowing us to keep the magic alive.When the 19-year-old Nicolas Anelka coolly scored from Ray Parlour’s delightful ball over the top from the halfway line, we believed. On the final whistle all pretence was gone and the small herd of north London kids erupted in celebrations next to a thick hedge on a slip of pavement.When I ask him, out of the blue, if he remembers that day, a former classmate and fellow Gooner, Paul Jackson, sends me racing back to us being allowed to watch the trophy being lifted on the small TV back where we were staying afterwards.That game set off a golden few months (and then years) of memories: wobbling precariously on a crowd barrier on the back of a flatbed lorry to catch a look at the Double winners on parade, the women’s team who had completed a League Cup and FA Cup double atop the bus behind gasping and being convinced, for a split second, that a shattered trophy would be across the back pages when Wrighty threw the FA Cup high into the air from the window of Islington town hall before catching it to mad celebration falling in love with players that would light up the summer’s World Cup.More than that, though, the 1998 FA Cup final gave me my first real glimpse of the power of football. I hadn’t watched it, I hadn’t followed it directly, but my god did it matter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20bfc8042234e41ab8967978faf67910c1defbdc/122_661_2459_1475/master/2459.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39204574b9df85eb92bbf1243382eaac","title":"korea k league watch live stream free jeonbuk v suwon bluewings","story":"Lee Dong-Gook - the one-time Middlesborough striker, and legend of Korean football for Jeonbuk and earlier in his career, Pohang - is adjudged man of the match. Not a bad cameo, from the veteran, then.Jose Morais’ side start their title defence with all three points, although Green Army fans might have liked to have seen a more emphatic scoreline, from a side that dominated both possession and territory.Suwon for their part started well with Terry Antonis lively in the heart of the Bluewings’ midfield. His senseless straight red card for a rash challenge 75 minutes in ultimately helped cost his side a share of the spoils. In truth though, they never properly came to grips with the slick passing game of Jose Morais’ chargers, did the visitors.Thanks for your company and emails tonight - apologies for those I couldn’t include. We don’t get to cover Korean football every week, but in a football-starved global context it’s great to get a close look at some of the leagues around the world. It’s been a factory line for producing young talent across the decades for the big clubs of England and Germany, but in its own right, the K-League is a very decent league.Jeonbuk Motors clinch it late, their title defence starts with a clean sheet and all three points. Good night!90 + 4 min: Ach, and would you believe the set piece doesn’t clear the wall! What a critical error - and our referee puts the whistle to the lips.It’s the veteran, Lee Dong-Gook - this colossus of Korean football - who fashioned the key decisive moment with a headed goal from Son Jun-Ho’s corner.They’re top of the table, the reigning champions - and they continue their strong run of recent form against old rivals Suwon! 90 + 4 min: They’re old rivals, but it’s not been an especially spiteful contest, that Terry Antonis challenge aside. Suwon chase it here - is this a last chance to flood forward? Jeonbuk funnel back - but they’ve conceded a freekick outside the box for a handball!We have a late, late set piece for Suwon! Does the ‘keeper come up too? Big final chance for the Bluewings!90 + 2 min: Kunimoto has looked lively since coming on - what a handy replacement he’s appeared to be after the tricky Murilo went off.Ach, and having won the ball, Suwon have turned it over, can you believe, for a foul throw! Jeonbuk look to head to the corners and eat up valuable seconds.89 min: Four additional minutes is the equation. Didn’t appear too many stoppages, but there was that two-minute VAR break, I guess.A slimmer of home for Bluewings supporters? They need to get a foot on the ball first, as Jeonbuk play keep-ball around the back - moving from the front-third all the way back to the ‘keeper.88 min: A final change for Jeonbuk - but that will have to wait, as the game restarts. Kim Bo-Kyung makes way and Lee Soo-Bin comes on.86 min: So, it’s Suwon with a mountain to climb late on - and with just ten men! But for all they’ve been on the back foot for large swathes of this second half, just one mistake, one lucky moment and they could be right back in this contest.It’s really starting to teem with rain now - will that aid or hinder the visitors? They move the Canadian, Henry, up front as an auxiliary striker, at least for a set piece to try and chase the contest.83 min: And there it is! And can you believe it - it’s the 41-year-old veteran who’s fashioned the opener. And that consistent near post policy from the corners finally pays off for the home side! He rose highest, having given the otherwise excellent Henry the slip, Lee Dong-Gook - and that is goal number 225 in the K-League. What a legend of the Korean game. And what a telling contribution this could prove!83 min: Scrambled away! It’s a desperate last intervention, at the expense of a corner, as Jeonbuk looked to pass that one through the box.Can they finally fashion something from this set piece?81 min: We enter the final ten, and you have to say - if they hang on for a point here, Suwon, they’ll be buzzing.They make their third change, and it is a defender for an attacker - Min Woo-Kim makes way for Jang Ho-Ik. So that clarifies that little mystery (see last post).78 min: Another substitute from Suwon, and it’s the skipper Yeom Ki-Hun who trots off for Seok Hee Han to come on. Is that a striker for a midfielder? I don’t imagine the Bluewings are chasing this, so perhaps there will be additional tactical changes elsewhere in their structure to accommodate that.Some more emails coming through - Haram has written in:I’m very excited that the  does this MBM. I missed the first half but I’m sure we’ll see more exciting stuff in the second half. Jeonbuk Motors is the most successful club in Korean not just in terms of their record but also in terms of their fanbase. They had an average of about 20,000 fans per game last year and they’re based in a city called Jeonju, which has 600,000 people. (Seoul FC comes the close second with a slightly less figure, but Seoul is a city of ten million people. You get the idea.)In any case, thanks for the commentaries. Hope we see the first goal soon! Cheers Haram - well it’s definitely got more exciting now, thanks to that straight red card.Apologies also to my Faeroes-ese (sic?) readers - it’s been drawn to my attention I accidentally wrote Icelandic football earlier! Mi scusi.75 min - Red card! Ach, that’s a nasty challenge, and it’s the Australian Terry Antonis who is given his marching order for a rash slide that catches his opponent on the calf.And Suwon do shuffle their pack, and it’s bad news for Australian viewers - it’s Adam Taggart who comes off as well.This makes it a little more lively - can the ten-men Suwon hang on? They had red cards in both their ACL matches this season, the cup winners - they’ll need to do it again with ten here.72 min: Suwon now looking to shuffle their pack - perhaps to arrest the momentum of recent minutes which has been all with Jeonbuk.Subsitute to come shortly.70 min: It’s Jeonbuk still probing and testing, but for all their possession and territorial dominance they’re yet to really open up this Suwon defence, which is now very much defending with a block of five.68 min: There’s some noise around the stadium - there are, as we said no fans in presence, so not sure if that’s coming from outside the grounds or is being pipped in artificially. I imagine it’s not the motley crew of gathered international journalists responsible for it.64 min: This is turning into quite a sustained period of pressure for the home side, Jeonbuk, as they earn another corner.We’ve got rain starting to fall in Jeonju, and again it’s a fast whipped ball close to the ‘keeper, who gets a strong fist away. They might need to try some variation at some stage, Jeonbuk. We’ll see.63 min: Jeonbuk with the corner, and again it’s a punch clear from No Dong-Geon in the Suwon goal. He’s been tested a few times from the set piece, perhaps a plan from the home coaching staff, but so far has stood up well to the inquisition.62 min: An early sighter for Lee Dong-Gook. He’s 41, the striker with over 100 caps for Korea and approaching 350 games for Jeonbuk. What a legend of Korean football - and that could have been some impact if he’d been able to get a forehead on that clever lofted cross to the far post. 59 min: It’s a long lofted ball into the box for Suwon, but Henry can’t find a teammate in blue. He then does some good work defensively to deny Murilo.Jose Morais says he’s seen enough, and Jeonbuk look ready to prepare a double substitute, as we approach the hour mark. It’s the veteran Lee Dong-Gook who replaces Cho Kyu-Song, and the Japanese youngster Kunimoto who comes on for Murilo.56 min: It was billed as a 3-4-3 pre-game, but Suwon are starting to revert to what looks decidedly like a 5-3-2, with the two wing backs dropping deeper and Kim Min-Woo sliding back into midfield.You’d suggest that will only invite further pressure for the visitors - let’s hope they don’t set out the defensive stall too early, for the spectacle’s sake alone.55 min: Jeonbuk looking to overcome that non-penalty award setback immediately, as Murilo sends in a tantalising ball from a freekick. It only just evades the outstretched forehead of a teammate - that was a wicked curling effort, and the Suwon defence was really scrambling!53 min: And it’s no penalty! Well, love that from a neutral’s perspective - in the A-League they’d give a penalty just because they’ve wasted everyone’s time for two minutes and probably feel they should justify the break. But he took several looks at the that, Kim Woo-Seong, and said - no dice, game on!51 min: A clever ball into the box for Jeonbuk, and we have a break in play as referee Kim Woo-Seong heads to the sideline to take a look at the VAR. Do we have a penalty!The ball bobbled between the bodies of two Suwon defenders, and appears to strike the hand of Doneil Henry - but does that meet whatever the present criteria for handball are?45 min: And like Michael Finnegan, we begin again - just a handful of peanuts and some dutch salted liquorice for your humble scribe.No immediate signs of any half-time substitutes, but we’ll bring you that information if it arises.An email in from Ravikiran: Hey Richard. It’s been so long since football that I’ve seriously decided to start following any active league that plays. Which K-League team should I be supporting? I support Liverpool if it helps to narrow things down..Ha, I know the feeling. It’s a good question - open to suggestions from those more in the know, but I’d lean Seongnam for you, Ravikiran? On the basis that they were powerhouses 20 years ago but haven’t won a title recently.. although by that basis, it’s been 12 years since Suwon added to their four K-League crowns, so they could be your team, at least for this fixture.One of the more fun things I’ve seen to help interested onlookers decide their new side was this from football in the Faeroes Islands:Although remember, a puppy isn’t just for Christmas. I can’t believe I went and got this Skála Ítróttarfelag tattoo, in retrospect. So - your thoughts on that first 45?K-League aficinados, was this a fair indication of Korean football? Or are both sides still showing slight sluggishness after nearly half a year away from the bright lights of domestic competition?Jeonbuk for their part are looking the side more likely, but they’ll be wary of the fact that last season’s golden boot winner, Adam Taggart, has shown some sharp contributions - especially in combination with fellow Australian Terry Antonis.45 + 2 min: Ooph! It’s a fine save! He needed to be sharp, No Dong-Geon, but he got his body behind that flicked effort, that came through a host of bodies at the near post.And that’s all we have for the opening stanza! A dramatic finish, and you’ll fancy the visitors will be the more relieved party. Fifteen minutes to regather, and revisit their tactics for the second stanza.45 min: A heavy challenge sees a free kick for Jeonbuk, as the fourth official indicates two additional minutes will be played.This time it’s Jeonbuk building down the right, before they switch flanks in search of Murilo. They earn a corner, off the header of Doneil Henry.Can they cap the half with a goal?43 min: Jeonbuk very much dictating proceedings in the shadow of half-time, as Lee Seung-Gi looks to wriggle free inside the box, but on this occasion his effort is a little more tame. Suwon will be looking for the half-time whistle, you’d imagine. They’re not being overrun, but it would be their coaching staff that are slightly more nervous in these sometimes game-defining minutes.40 min: Patient stuff at the back from Jeonbuk once again before they fire a more direct pass forward, which falls kindly for Cho. Lee Seung-Gi then fires an effort goalwards - ooph! That’s only just wide of the upright - that’s a fine strike, from 25m out, and he had No Dong-Geon really scrambling. 38 min: Freekick to Jeonbuk, about 30m out. It’s Son Jun-Ho with the long ranger blaster, but it clatters into the four-man wall!A good little patch of pressure this, for the home side, but we remain locked nil-nil.36 min: Clever touch from Taggart releases a teammate but Jeonbuk snuff out the move. It’s the tricky feet of Murilo again probing and testing the right-side of Suwon’s defence, before Kim Bo-Kyung fashions a shot, that’s deflected behind for a corner!They don’t make the most of the chance, and the ‘keeper comfortably comes and claims the set piece opportunity.33 min: A nice switch sends Suwon’s left wing back scampering forward, but Jeonbuk shuffle and reorganise. They’re forced to clear long to prevent Antonis from getting on the ball in a dangerous part of the pitch, and Suwon build again from the back.31 min: Han Kyo-Won with a shot! But it’s brought back for offside, replays suggest correctly. It was a clever darting run from midfield to open the Suwon defence, but just marginally mistimed. Still, a warning sign from the home side.28 min: The Canadian, Henry, goes through his opponent, Cho Kyu-Song, but the referee doesn’t deem it a foul.Before Murilo tries to jink past one or two defenders near the edge of the box. Lovely feet from the Brazilian but he blazes his final effort high and wide!25 min: Suwon forced to clear their lines once again. Jeonbuk are starting to harry and hurry their opponents in the centre of the park, their five-man midfield enjoying the edge on Suwon’s nominal four-man line up.23 min: A nice passage of play from Jeonbuk who thread their passes patiently, before drawing a throw in deep near the corner flag.They’re enjoying the larger portion of the early territory, the home side. Can they make that pay early on?21 min: A nice cut and thrust starting to develop now, as both sides look to break quickly in transition and catch their opponents.A first corner to Jeonbuk but it’s headed clear at the near post by the Suwon defence.18 min: Suwon with another chance to hit on the counter, but they can’t make their passes stick and Jeonbuk stream forward in turn. It ends in a hopeful effort from Son Jun-Ho.And at the other end a first real chance! Fine hands from the ‘keeper who gets down well to block Taggart’s goalbound effort. Replays suggest he may have been in an offside position, the Australian striker, but it was nevertheless sharp goalkeeping from Sung Bum-Keun.15 min: A shot of South Korean coach Paulo Bento up in the stands, watching on. Three’s definitely a Portuguese flavour overhanging this match, with Jose Morais - the only foreign manager in the K-League this season - also leaving an impact on Korean football, winning his first domestic title with Jeonbuk.14 min: Another early sighter for Jeonbuk - both sides appear content to slowly adjust the shooting radars, but again, no huge concern between the posts for Dong-geon.12 min: A second booking! Jeonbuk’s right back Lee Yong goes in the book for attempting to pull back his opposite number who had open pastures in which to run.It’s been a little stop-start so far - let’s hope the whistle doesn’t dominate the early proceedings as both sides find their match fitness once again.9 min: Suwon with a good chance to counter, but the ball in looking for Taggart is overhit and forces the striker wide. He then concedes the freekick with a raised boot in a challenge on Jeonbuk’s Choi Bo-Kyung.And it’s earned Taggart a yellow card! He was unsure pre-game about the “talking to officials” rule, we can confirm, that caution was for the challenge alone.8 min: Suwon’s Canadian centre half Doneil Henry wins a freekick. He was fortunate there perhaps, he almost look to have lost possession in a dangerous area, but the whistle saves his blushes.5 min: An early touch for Taggart, last season’s K-League golden boot winner, who drops deep to collect, but both sides are guilty of giving away early possession. A few rusty touches as you can well imagine after a five-and-a-half month hiatus from league football.Taggart fires off a first effort for Suwon - it’s a worm-burner from the left foot on the pivot from outside the box, but it rolls harmlessly wide of Song’s left-hand upright.3 min: Jeonbuk looking to build some early sustained possession, and it’s the Brazilian, Murilo, who cuts in onto his right foot - his non-preferred foot - but his shot does not overly concern the Suwon ‘keeper.He’s the only foreign player starting for Jeonbuk with Japan’s Kunimoto left on the bench. Two Australians and a Canadian start for Suwon.1 min: And we’re away! It’s a new K-League season, but have we ever seen such internation interest in Korean football?The home side playing left to right in a fetching “yellow highlighter” trikot, Suwon, right to left in their customary all blue kit.The big match news is that Jeonbuk’s star Ereisie recruit, the South African striker Lars Veldwijk has pulled up short, fitness wise, and will not lead the line for Jose Morais’ team.Both these clubs have experienced an indifferent start to their respective Asian Champions League campaigns.Suwon lost to a 90th minute winner away to Andres Iniesta’s Vissel Kobe, before a shock loss on the road to Malaysia’s Johor. Jeonbuk lost 2-1 at home to Ange Postecoglou’s J-League champions, Yokohama F. Marinos, before salvaging a last-ditch draw on the road to the reigning A-League champions Sydney FC, 2-2.It’s three years since the Suwon Bluewings beat their hosts today on their own patch - the World Cup stadium in Jeonju. It’s capacity 42,000 but without fans today. A smattering of the world’s press have been allowed in everyone inside the stadium is wearing PPE equipment such as masks.History is very much with Jeonbuk who boast 20 wins to Suwon’s seven historically, and they’ve had the wood on their opponents recently. As we know though, this is a completely different reality now, and whoever has been able to keep their preparations as unaffected as possible could have the edge, especially in terms of fitness.Without further ado, to our team lists for tonight:So - what does football in the post Covid-19 world look like? No fans in the stadium is the obvious first point, but in addition to this we’ll have no handshakes, conversation between players and officials will be restricted, and coaches will have to wear face masks.A setback for sideline ranters, therefore - hopefully we’ll see more comedic mime antic from the coaching boxes. Players have also been advised “excessive spitting or blowing of the nose is prohibited”. The Korean equivalents of Jonny Evans and Papiss Cisse be warned.Let’s hope not. Although fans of various iterations of “fast soccer” might go in for a full-field 7 v 7 style demonstration.Ahead of this week’s round of games all 1100 players and staff in the K-League were tested and cleared for Covid-19. It’s a remarkable statistic compared to what’s happening in other countries around the world presently - let’s hope it stays that way.For more on this historic fixture, here’s our eyes in the region John Duerden’s match preview:Hi all! Richard Parkin in the chair, and delighted to be here as well. It’s been a seemingly interminable wait since we last had live football, and I for one am loving the chance to get a close-up look at the South Korean game.Australian followers know these clubs reasonably well from Asian Champions League clashes across the years (and some of the players from national team age-level humiliations across the years), but for many international readers this could be their first K-League game. We’ll try to do it justice.If you’re a passionate aficionado of the #KLeague don’t hestitate to share the wealth of your insights with us - join the conversation via email or twitter. We’d love to hear predictions, fun facts, general observations.Football is back! With the utmost respect to Torpedo Zhodino and fans of the Belarus Premier League, of course (Nicaragua, Burundi etc) - but with the start of the K-League, it’s the first, arguably, top-tier league back in action across the planet.South Korea’s swift state-orchestrated response to the coronavirus has reaped idends in that its people can enjoy live football once again. Not from the terraces, of course, but hey, you can’t have it all. The K-League was meant to start in February, so many of these players will have endured an impatient off-season akin to the A-League’s fabled five-month preparation.

Does the jam or cream go on a scone first (and how do you pronounce scone)? Does pineapple belong on a pizza? And should your Heinz ketchup be kept in the fridge? (For the record: jam then cream rhyme it with “gone” certainly not and yes, definitely. Glad we cleared that up.)But few foods have triggered so many lengthy debates as the satisfyingly saucy baked bean. A British icon, the fierce loyalty these delicious legumes stir up is unparalleled. Which is the best bread to put them on? Is it OK to eat them cold? And should they really be touching other food on the plate? We’re here to solve these saucy conundrums once and for all. (Please note: the editor’s decision is final.)1 Beans should be enjoyed cold as wellWhile it’s traditional to heat up your Heinz Beanz, there are purists who swear by eating them cold, usually straight out of the tin. While we suspect their argument is partially based on sheer laziness, this is an easy one: either way of eating them is fine, but the best path to take is both. The true baked bean connoisseur snaffles a few tasty forkfuls after opening the tin, before heating the rest up.3 Acceptable toppingsThe beauty of baked beans is their versatility, which in turn can lead to tough decisions about which toppings, if any, are the best. We’ve heard cases for cooked chorizo, crispy bacon, hot sauce, chopped parsley, dried herbs and (of course) enough cheese to fell a horse. The short answer is that all these toppings, including none at all, are acceptable (except for non-cheddar cheeses, more of which later). Although, if you stir ketchup, brown sauce or, God forbid, mayonnaise into your beans, somebody needs to stage an intervention.4 The cheese rulesDespite their workmanlike appearance, cheesy beans are a thing of great beauty and delicate balance, and must be properly executed. The rules are as follows: cheddar is the only acceptable cheese. None of your gruyere or feta nonsense here, please. At a push, you might crumble in some Wensleydale, but cheddar offers the correct tanginess to offset the beans’ sweetness, and can be finely grated so the cheese drifts on to the beans like a soft, tasty blanket. Thickly grated cheddar is also delicious, but tends to stubbornly sit there, refusing to melt. Finally, while cheese stirred into beans is undoubtedly delicious, it’s simply not the correct way – the light dusting of cheese must melt into the beans on its own.5 No napkins, embrace the sauceDo you want to be that person with the napkin tucked under their chin in the work canteen? Do you? No, you do not. Beans, by their nature, love to throw themselves off your fork and bounce their saucy way down your clean shirt, like a stone skimmed by a champ. Wear your day-glo stains as a badge of honour. Your lunch was better than anyone else’s.6 Set the beans freeOf all the baked bean debates, the one about whether it’s OK for them to touch other foodstuffs in a full English breakfast is the most controversial. While there’s no question beans are an integral part of the meal, some people prefer theirs on the side, to avoid the sauce infiltrating any of the more absorbent items (eg bread, hash browns). Let’s be clear, though: serving your baked beans in a rubbish little ramekin is entirely unacceptable. If you really must separate them, the correct protocol is to create an edible holding pen fashioned out of sausages and bacon.7 The right type of breadThere are more ways to eat baked beans than there are beans in a tin (on average, 465 in total)! But although baked potatoes, crumpets, waffles or a bowl straight from the microwave are all acceptable vehicles for getting baked beans inside you, the classic accompaniment is toasted, buttered bread. When you pour your beans on to the toast, a corner must be left bean-free, to be saved for juice-mopping duties. And the correct bread choice is white or wholemeal and pre-sliced: no arguing. If you want to go really fancy, we’ll allow an uncut bloomer. But this isn’t the time for posh breads: none of your rye, pumpernickel or sourdough should be getting involved.

(The business was sold earlier this week, after the end of the quarter.)Thomson said the results “demonstrate the strength of News Corp and the power of our premium content”.He said the company had US$1.4bn in “cash and cash equivalents” on hand and the ability to borrow an additional US$750m.Following the sale of News America Marketing the company was “continuing to simplify our company to highlight the intrinsic value of our core businesses, including the strategic review of our Australian newspaper holdings, focusing on our larger brands and our digital reach”, he said.“Clearly the pandemic will have an impact on our results in the fourth quarter, but all of our businesses are embarking on cost-cutting programs intended to deal with short-term need but also to ensure that the company is well-equipped to prosper in a decidedly different business environment after the crisis abates.”The hunger for information about the coronavirus has sent readership numbers skyrocketing during the pandemic, but many news organisations have struggled to convert the extra attention into dollars due to the devastation the shutdown has wrought on big advertisers such as retailers.News Corp last month suspended printing 60 regional Australian titles after real estate, event and restaurant ads dried up.In March the chief executive of News Corp Australasia, Michael Miller, warned staff it was “clear that some job losses will be inevitable” due to the crisis.To cut costs, some staff have also been asked to take leave or work a shorter week.However, Thomson said subscriptions were up at News Corp’s Dow Jones ision, which includes its financial masthead, the Wall Street Journal. The Journal “reached approximately 3 million subscribers in the last week, a new record, with over 2.2 million that are digital-only”, he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98294134d254fe5412b541a1933866049b0d1fb3/0_390_5184_3108/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04e2e576cc388f72b4dc774611f142bf","title":"homebuyers plotting move to country amid increased home working","story":"Estate agents report rise in buyer registrations around Winchester and BerkshireAfter the lockdown, the exodus. Estate agents are reporting a surge in the numbers of would-be homebuyers plotting a move out of the city to a rural area or smaller town as people conclude that home working is here to stay.Firms said that during the last few weeks they had seen a big increase in enquiries about well-connected countryside and “out of city” locations – ranging from English market towns to Scottish fishing villages – where people could split their working week between home and office once life starts to return to normal.The upmarket estate agent Savills said locations that had seen a rise in buyer registrations included the areas in and around Winchester in Hampshire, Newbury in Berkshire, Canford Cliffs in Dorset and the East Neuk of Fife on the east coast of Scotland.Lockdown appears to be prompting many people to reassess what is important to them, whether that is a desire to continue working from home for part of the week once normal service resumes or wanting a bigger garden for their children to play in.The pandemic has effectively pushed the UK housing market into a temporary deep freeze, with people being told by the government to postpone moving until a later date, and there have been claims that several hundred thousand home sales will be abandoned this year.Andrew Perratt, the head of country residential at Savills, said it might be easy to dismiss an increase in web visits as largely being down to “bored dreamers” sitting at home surfing the internet, but he added: “What is most significant for me is the jump in new buyer registrations.”Perratt said the big demand was for properties in “the country markets around the major cities,” which included villages and market towns.The mass switch to working from home had proved that “you don’t need to be in London, or another city, five days a week,” he said. “I think there are lessons to be learned for all of us in terms of the number of times we need to visit a city during a working week.”This prompted the firm to talk about a potential “rural renaissance”. Winchester has reasonably good rail links with London, with a journey time of just over an hour, and lies at the western end of the South Downs national park. The average house price there is £419,000, compared with £477,000 in London, according to the most recent official Land Registry data.Newbury is well known for its strong transport links, lies on the edge of the Berkshire Downs and is surrounded by attractive villages such as Highclere and Hermitage.Perratt said his theory was that Canford Cliffs, an affluent suburb of Poole in Dorset, was an area where some wealthy Londoners were lucky enough to already own a bolthole to escape to, and that some may be looking to “flip” their life so that this becomes their principal residence instead of London.Similarly with the East Neuk of Fife, which includes picturesque fishing towns such as Anstruther, people might be looking to swap their Edinburgh townhouse for a smaller flat and use the proceeds to buy a bigger home on the coast, he added.At the Douglas Allen branch in Brentwood, Essex, manager Reece Giles said interest from potential buyers in nearby London boroughs looking to relocate to the area “has kind of gone through the roof”. The Brentwood area includes villages such as Navestock that offer the benefits of rural life but are within an easy commute of London.The Savills research also found that one in six respondents were ready for a longer commute, with the firm saying it believed some people would be prepared to put up with a two-hour journey to work if they were only going into the office for a couple of days a week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ee590b5e1f20adaeae11f2db2d75061e541780f/0_255_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af32c8e27338849bc0d087889611f7a2","title":"we need a coronavirus mortgage strategy as well as an exit one","story":"From payment holiday extensions to a better welfare net, here are a few ideas for governmentCurrently 1.6 million homeowners are not paying their mortgages after taking a “payment holiday” at the start of the coronavirus crisis. But the three-month break from payments – typically worth £755 a month – will come to an end much sooner than this crisis. What next?Boris Johnson will set out Britain’s lockdown exit strategy this weekend. We’re told its sunbathing and picnics straightaway, maybe schools and cafes opening by the end of June, and pubs and restaurants by the end of August – so long as social distancing is maintained. Try choreographing that in a Friday night bar.The reality is that hotels, pubs, cinemas, restaurants, conference centres, music venues, gyms and all the trades that supply them are unlikely to return to anywhere near normal ahead of next year. Add to that the collapse in the aviation industry – employment in whole towns such as Crawley, near Gatwick, is being wiped out – and it’s pretty inevitable that millions of people will remain out of work throughout this year.The current mortgage payment-holiday sticking plaster isn’t enough. When, from June, the three-month period arranged by borrowers and their banks expires (and the chancellor also begins to unwind the furlough scheme) huge numbers of householders will still need help. And there’s no word from government yet about what, if anything, comes next.Here are a few ideas kicking around the mortgage industry which the chancellor could consider:This is the more likely option. The banks, to their credit, put the new payment holiday systems in place extraordinarily rapidly (funny the things Britain is good at – payment systems rather than virus testing or PPE production). Privately, they believe that a not insignificant number applied for a payment holiday as a “nice to have” rather than a necessity. If they are to prolong the current holidays, the banks want to be much more selective about who they give it to.The crisis has revealed to the middle classes how threadbare Britain’s welfare system really is. If you are unemployed and applying for universal credit, you can’t access mortgage support until you have been claiming benefits and not earning for nine months. The calculation of the benefit is, inevitably, absurdly complicated. And it’s not even really a benefit – it’s a loan that accrues interest and has to be paid back. The designers of the system evidently never envisaged the enormous, if temporary, dislocation brought on by a pandemic.UK Finance, the group that represents the banks, told me they are “carefully considering options for those who may need further support at the end of the three-month payment holiday period”. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, may want to give them a bit of a hard nudge. We are going to need something more robust in place in weeks, not months.Meanwhile the forgotten millions in this story are tenants in the private rented sector. Economically, this crisis is devastating the young, many of whom were working in low-paid jobs in the hospitality and services sector. When the furlough scheme ends and the temporary ban on evictions lapses, the prospects for many in their 20s and 30s is grim. There are payment holidays for mortgage holders and landlords, loans for businesses, bailouts for big firms, but for tenants, almost nothing. Youth unemployment is often the most intractable problem after a recession, and we are at risk of throwing a whole generation on the economic scrapheap."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c2385d7de6a726513eef6fb642a6bea994992de/0_237_3788_2272/master/3788.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f956a58b02cf29236bc599007141aba","title":"a freudian nightmare madonnas blond ambition tour turns 30","story":"Three decades on, the controversy-courting concert tour is still shaping the ways female artists express their sexualityIn Toronto, Madonna simulated masturbation on a velvet bed under the watchful eye of the Canadian police, who threatened her with arrest if her show went ahead. In Italy, unions called for a general strike if Madonna performed, and Pope John Paul II declared her concert “one of the most satanic shows in the history of humanity”. The Blond Ambition tour, which turned 30 years old last month, remains among the most controversial tours of all time.It seems bizarre now that so much fuss was made over a little fake frotting and a few gyrating nuns. But this was 1990, when Kylie Minogue was still performing in straw hats, Bananarama were deemed dangerous and the gossip pages raged over Annie Lennox singing Would I Lie to You in a bra. Into this age of relative wholesomeness landed Blond Ambition Madonna, on a mission to combine fashion, rock, Broadway theatricality and performance art, to “be provocative” and “break useless taboos”. Mission accomplished. Jean Paul Gaultier’s famous conical corset has been described as a “Freudian nightmare”, a generation of teenagers asked their parents what S\u0026ampM stood for, and the coy suggestiveness of the live pop spectacle was blown wide open.The themed set-pieces – religion, German expressionism, art deco, Madge’s rubbish new movie Dick Tracy – set a new bar for confrontational theatricality that only greater shock tactics could ever challenge. Marilyn Manson’s onstage Bible shredding is straight out of the “Madonna 90” guidebook, and with her firework bras, stage blood and copious dry-humping, Lady Gaga looks as if she was conceived at a Blond Ambition gig. But the key taboo Madonna broke that summer was that of feminine sexuality as strength rather than titillation, as something owned by the artist not cashed in by the svengalis. That’s what gave us SexKylie, “zig-a-zig-AH!”, Wrecking Ball-era Miley and Nicki Minaj’s bottom-obsessed Anaconda. It’s one of the reasons female artists feel comfortable singing about sex and desire today.Sex sells, though, and more sex sells more. Over the decades, overt sexuality became the expected – nay, contractual – pop norm. Attention-grabbing boundaries were pushed to their limits, and artists were pressured to play this new, ever raunchier game. Enter Billie Eilish, defiantly covered, mocking the uber-sexualised expectations of modern pop with a film of her stripping off beneath blackened water: “If I wear more, if I wear less, who decides what that makes me?” she intones, shaming the bodyshamers and staring out the monetisable male gaze. By asserting ownership of her body she is not re-establishing any old taboos, she’s breaking the oldest one of all – subservience. Her image, her body, her art, her rules. Which was Madonna’s point all along."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5777c704694e54f6e256bc1e30037de59df566d4/0_238_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f4b37b33c0b92a1cc34c80cab9aa6b5","title":"ty dextrous artist uk rap culture coronavirus","story":"Ty, who has died aged 47 of coronavirus, was a sharp and witty MC who ably nourished the UK hip-hop scene despite being ignored by the mediaThe death of British rapper Ty, aged 47, to complications from coronavirus came as a shock because it had appeared he was on his way to recovery after being moved out of intensive care. And for those of us who grew up with Ty’s voice circling our bedrooms, the shock resonates: this is an artist who touched so many with his humour and sharpness on the mic.While all eyes were on grime in the early 2000s, Ty was charting a journey to a frontier that had yet to be fully explored. In 2001, he released his debut album, Awkward, on Big Dada, one of the few labels that would give a home to UK hip-hop acts such as Roots Manuva, Juice Aleem and Speech Debelle. It was the year of era-defining US albums such as Jay-Z’s The Blueprint and Nas’s Stillmatic, when the mainstream had gone the way of the shiny suit. But across the Atlantic, Ty ushered in the UK’s own hip-hop golden age, leaning towards the genre’s soul, jazz and funk origins.Ty was a bridge. He showed that the isions between UK hip-hop and the upstart genre, grime, were illusory his music conjures memories of the Kung Fu club night at Camden’s Underworld, where you’d see grime and hip-hop heads shoulder to shoulder. He understood that many of the young MCs coming up in grime came from the same blocks and streets as the rappers in the hip-hop space. His appearance alongside Skepta and others on the remix of Bashy’s Black Boys showed this guest spots on other tracks such as Let It Go by Rukus – which flirts with the borders of grime and hip-hop – also revealed just how ambidextrous his flow was. By now it was 2007, and fans had firmly drawn lines between UK hip-hop, grime and road rap. But it was evident in Ty’s collaborations that all genres were of the same genealogical tree.At the same time, it’s important to acknowledge Ty’s staunch criticism of an industry that has historically failed to give UK hip-hop its proper due. UK hip-hop first made waves in the 80s with the likes of London Posse – Ty would later work with Posse member Rodney P as part of supergroup Kingdem with Blak Twang – but it struggled for attention in British media, first amid the Britpop indie boom, then later as grime had the shock of the new. As recently as 2018 Ty was complaining that “our music is considered ‘unclassic’ by mainstream British culture. It’s considered throwaway and vague.”He also criticised some within the scene, drawing comparisons between more commercial rap music and what he saw as the greater integrity of hip-hop. In 2006 he said the British scene “deserves the cold shoulder it’s getting because it’s not pushed forward … what people are doing … is really rap music, which just focuses on the production of the music. Hip-hop is the whole thing.” He concluded: “I am treated like a little child in the UK because I do hip-hop.”Arguably, though, the scene thrived out of plain sight and remained unadulterated. He could create comedy sketches informed by life experiences we could all relate to, such as on Hercules, about the acute anxieties of the school playground: “Bazooka Bubblegum, Space Dust and Wham!  Technicolour bed fluff meant I wasn’t the man  For kiss chase, now that was a real trauma  girls would break down and cry if I caught them in a corner.” Few songs carried depth and potency quite like The Nonsense from Awkward, with its bruised psychedelic soul, or The Willing from his Mercury-nominated second album Upwards, featuring the late Tony Allen, who died just last week.For someone like me who grew up second-gen in a Nigerian household, hearing Ty work with someone who could have been his father, or grandfather, spoke to how intergenerational UK hip-hop has always been, and how Ty advocated for that. He founded a hip-hop education programme in the 1990s called Ghetto Grammar, but the work didn’t stop when he signed to Big Dada – last year he hosted an event, Pass the Torch, a showcase of talent with Ty nourishing the next generation of MCs. On social media there’s been an outpouring of love from artists such as Awate, Children of Zeus and Akala who all saw him as a mentor of sorts – the tributes pouring in show just how many people Ty poured his wisdom into.There’s an unsettling irony in Ty receiving so much love and praise in his passing when he was ignored for so long. But it’s clear that, away from the media, he was the soundtrack to a lot of people’s lives in the early 2000s and beyond, and it was the potency and depth in his lyricism and storytelling that drew us closer. Ty’s work showed how much of a fallacy the ides in British rap have been – we would do well to do as he did and strive for excellence regardless of genre.There is no comparison to him the old patronising framing of “the UK version of (insert US name here)” won’t work. Ty’s artistry was unique, bound by his own lived experiences and the way he saw the world, communicated through his gift of repartee and sharpness. When the time comes to weave the tapestry telling UK hip-hop’s whole story, Ty has to be one of the key threads."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ff969f20f624a89c5585d3811598674ac134743/0_12_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74704683d58599724162bdf64e619e5e","title":"reopening mississippi americas poorest state begins lifting lockdown podcast","story":"Despite rising coronavirus case numbers, the US state of Mississippi is moving out of lockdown and reopening parks, restaurants and other non-essential shops.

I’m also able to confirm today that since 5 March a total of 3016 patients who had tested positive and been hospitalised have been able to leave hospital and I wish all of them, and the families. Unfortunately I also have to report that in the past 24 hours, 49 deaths have been registered or patients who had been confirmed through a test as having Covid-19, that takes the total number of deaths in Scotland, under that measurement to 1,811.You can follow the Scottish government’s news conference here:The epidemiological term ‘harvesting’ is tragically applicable to the way we have failed to shield vulnerable people from coronavirus, writes Richard Coker, the emeritus professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.Next up will be the Scottish government’s press conference. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, will be joined by the chief constable of Police Scotland, Iain Livingstone and Jason Leitch, Scotland’s national clinical director. The Welsh government provided these slides on the estimated 0.8 R value in Wales and the various projected impacts on hospital admissions and deaths if that changes.Here’s a transcript of what Drakeford said about the decision not to open schools on 1 June.We don’t know what the UK government will be saying about schools in England, so I’m not going to speculate on that. I said, a week ago, that it needed three weeks from the point you made the decision to a school reopening. We’re at that point where if we’ve made the decision schools will be reopening in Wales in June. We’re not making that decision today for all the reasons I’ve already set out. And that’s why Kirsty Williams our education minister confirmed that schools in Wales wouldn’t be reopening in that major way in June.Despite Drakeford’s wording there is still a chance that schools could reopen in Wales at the end of June.Q: What level would R need to be before lockdown is lifted or adjustments reimposed? We will be watching R like a hawk, Drakeford said. If it increases the adjustments will be reversed. Drakeford said the R rate in care homes is higher than in the community but he did not say by how much. Q: Will policing be difficult if there are different lockdown policies in the UK nations?Drakeford said: “We are managing. I want to make it clear to people thinking of travelling to Welsh beaches or mountains that Wales is still under lockdown. Don’t do it.” Q: How open has the Westminster government been?It has been one of “fits and starts”, Drakeford said. “When we have discussions it is good, it would be better to have regular discussions.” Q: Is Wales still in lockstep with England and what about schools opening?Drakeford said: “We will maintain a four nations approach but timings could vary. We don’t know what the UK government will say about schools. We are not making a decision to reopen schools in June.” Q: Is there a danger of mixing messages? Drakeford says there is no chance of that. He said the message was to stay safe and stay local. Q: When will there be a route map out of lockdown? Drakeford said there will be a need to spell out a road map to lifting the lockdown. That needs to be coordinated with the other UK nations on Sunday. He said lifting the exercise restrictions was about improving people’s well being and mental health. Q: What’s the point of tiny changes that could affect the messaging? Drakeford said reviewing the lockdown is about making modest adjustments. It has not produced any major changes, but the adjustments will make a difference to people. Q: Will similar changes be made in England? Drakeford said he spoke to Boris Johnson yesterday. It will be for him to decide what to do in England. But only modest changes are likely in England, Drakeford said. The first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, says it is too soon to ease the lockdown in Wales. He says the R reproductive rate of the virus in Wales is currently estimated to be 0.8. He warned that 800 people would die of the virus in Wales, but if the lockdown is lifted that figure would increase to more than 7,000. Drakeford said three “small and modest adjustments” could be made in Wales. There was no mention of schools. Government scientific advisers are furious at what they see as an attempt to censor their advice on government proposals during the Covid-19 lockdown by heavily redacting an official report before it was released to the public, the  can reveal.The report was one of a series of documents published by the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) this week to mollify growing criticism about the lack of transparency over the advice given to ministers responding to the coronavirus.However large blocks of text in the report, produced by SPI-B, the Sage subcommittee providing advice from behavioural scientists on how the public might respond to lockdown measures, were entirely blanked out.Several SPI–B members told the  that the redacted portions of the document contained criticisms they had made of potential government policies they had been formally asked to consider in late March and early April.The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, is being praised for his VE day message and his handling of the coronavirus crisis by Conservative commentators and outlets. In the next hour or so, the first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford will reveal the next stage of the Welsh government’s lockdown plans. A press conference is due to start at 12.30pm. Earlier this week he suggested that schools in Wales could reopen at the beginning of June. “Our advice from the trade unions and from the local education authorities is that you will need three weeks as a minimum from the point that we decide to do that, to when schools can reopen, so we are talking about the beginning of June,” he told the BBC.At 1.30pm the Scottish government is due to give its daily briefing. On Thursday, Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, ruled out any significant lifting of the lockdown. She also warned that changing the stay at home message would be a “catastrophic” mistake."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a21d7417ebec1633c0a3487e9cd8bbf9d3328c6/0_0_2432_1459/master/2432.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dde7ac63f5078e95186ca14c9fce5d12","title":"tech layoffs coronavirus uber airbnb","story":"Juul, Yelp and hundreds of startups among tech firms cutting jobs while Amazon and Zoom see huge boostsThe economic fallout from the coronavirus has come to Silicon Valley, with major tech firms announcing layoffs in recent weeks.Uber cited the pandemic in its filing, saying Covid-19 had affected its entire business, including financial performance, investments in new products, ability to attract drivers, and corporate strategy.Uber’s announcement came after several other tech companies said they were making cuts amid the crisis. Big tech companies are not the only members of the industry affected. About 375 startups have laid off more than 42,000 employees since 11 March, according to a layoff tracking site.Yet not all tech firms are suffering in equal measure. In the first three months of 2020, Amazon made more than $33m per hour, according to its earnings report last week, boosted by a surge in ordering from customers locked down at home. The delivery startup Instacart had to hire 300,000 workers in less than a month as more people began to order groceries online. The online video conference tool Zoom, which was valued at $36 per share when it went public in 2019, is now valued at $150 per share and its user base recently surpassed 300 million.But with closed borders, travel bans, and stay-at-home orders around the world, travel-related tech companies are disproportionately affected, said Carl Uminski, a tech industry analyst and co-founder of the digital consultancy Somo.“It’s well understood now that the impact Covid-19 has had on the entire travel industry is absolutely colossal,” he said. “Not only has the industry stopped, it will never be exactly the same again and nobody knows exactly what it is going to look like.”As another means of ersifying its revenue, Uber invested $170m in the scooter-rental startup Lime, which is now valued at $510m, Lime said in a statement on Thursday. Through the partnership, Lime will acquire Uber’s bike-sharing operation, called Jump, and the two companies will further integrate their apps.The layoffs come as ridesharing companies face another major challenge in the form of a lawsuit from the state of California. The state attorney general, Xavier Becerra, announced on Tuesday that the state is suing the firms for misclassifying drivers as contractors rather than employees under a new law meant to address labor rights of gig economy workers.The pandemic is testing the structure of the typical startup, said Uminski. The “move fast and break things” mentality central to new businesses in recent years relies on disrupting industries fast to gain marketshare, and focusing on profitability later. This only works when the market is doing well, he said.“Uber, Lyft, Airbnb and many others have all done exactly this and then suddenly, almost overnight, their industry has stopped,” he said. “I believe these new giants will also be tested on their true agility and whether they still have that start-up culture within.”As long as people remain wary of getting close to strangers, gig economy companies like Uber and Airbnb will suffer, said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush securities.“Until there is a vaccine for the virus, the next one or two years is going to have some darker days ahead for these business models,” he said.There is a chance the companies will adapt: Uber found that its delivery service Uber Eats has seen demand surge in recent months, even as its main business declines.“Uber and Lyft and many other companies are trying to adjust their business models to the category 5 storm that is Covid,” Ives said. “The gig economy is right in the eye of it.”In addition to the gig economy firms, other companies are facing a downturn as the economy struggles. WeWork has laid off hundreds of staffers as many Americans work from home, and workers may be wary of shared office spaces for some time.Yelp, which bases much of its revenue on advertisements sold to restaurants and shops listing on the site, has felt the impact of countless businesses closing due to lockdown orders. Other companies, like Juul, may simply be feeling the broader impact of an economic downturn.All told, Ives said, few companies will escape the effects of coronavirus. “There are some areas that are seeing growth, especially those that involve working from home and consumer-driven delivery, that are seeing unprecedented growth,” he said. “But those are fewer and far between.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50bb2ef31d4f3962349f2993a008836d3158b457/150_74_2757_1655/master/2757.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b370aba356a26fbc51d4ae415216e3d","title":"the eddy review damien chazelle netflix","story":"Far from La La Land, Damien Chazelle’s Netflix series struggles to meld its story of poverty and precarity in the Parisian underbelly with its extended musical interludes If you come to The Eddy (Netflix) with hopes for a reprise of its executive producer and lead director Damien Chazelle’s Oscar-winning La La Land, you should set them quietly aside. Look elsewhere for your sunlit musical romcom needs, and save his new eight-part series for your darker moods.The Eddy is set in Paris. Not in the city’s sparkling centre but in the grittier, graffitied margins. The title takes its name from the jazz club owned and run by virtuosic jazz pianist Elliot (André Holland) who fled New York for Europe when his young son died, and his friend Farid (Tahar Rahim), whose ebullience and optimism are in stark contrast to his withdrawn and wounded friend.It’s a world of hustlers and immigrants, united by their ability to come together and make music – if not quite enough money. There are glimpses of hope, when respected managers appear at the back of the audience to cast an appraising eye on the talent but it never amounts to anything more than a word of encouragement or an exhortation for Elliot to get up on stage himself and return to what he does best.His club is struggling. Bands play to half-empty rooms and Elliot has added another complication to his business venture by having – and breaking off – a relationship Maja (Joanna Kulig), the singer of the best band they host. Feelings twang like a untuned double bass and although Farid does his best to restore harmony, the musicians and everyone else are unsettled and frustratingly – sometimes literally – out of sync with each other. To this mess is added Elliot’s rebellious teenage daughter Julie (Amandla Stenberg) who arrives from New York to spend some time with her dear old dad, and possibly to escape her drug habit and her stepfather.The only remotely happy character is Farid, a devoted husband and father whose tender, sexy relationship with his wife (Amira, played by Leïla Bekhti) springs to life beautifully in just a handful of scenes. So it is of a piece with this unrelievedly sombre and melancholic series that Farid is soon killed. He had borrowed money from criminal gangs to try to save the Eddy from financial ruin. In a way, the plan works – at least temporarily – as the club fills with gawkers and ghouls eager to spend an evening at a murder scene.Each episode centres on a different character and their more-or-less bedevilled backgrounds, involving drug abuse, poverty and various forms of chaos that the semi-itinerant musician is susceptible to. The Eddy sustains them – it is a place of relative calm (at least for those not charged with keeping it afloat) where they can rest and gather themselves to create a few minutes of magic on stage before the current of life snatches them away again.There is little narrative light or air let into its eight hours. What it has instead is large pauses to let the cast – who are almost all accomplished musicians or singers, many in their first acting roles – play full jazz numbers. All the tunes are original (written by Glen Ballard and Randy Kerber), and the performance and rehearsal scenes dominate they are filmed at such length and in such loving detail that it is obvious where the creator’s heart and interest lies. Chazelle may only have directed the first two episodes, but he sets the tone.And the sessions are brilliant. But they don’t serve the slow, slight plot and for anyone whose interests lie more in the drama than the music, these extended interludes may well tip the balance into outright tedium. Call it the Treme trap.The script, by Bafta-award winning Jack Thorne (This Is England, National Treasure, the recent adaptation of His Dark Materials and much outstanding else besides) is not one that shines, though it does dip in and out of multiple languages, and give a great sense of the deeper bond among the people who end up in the Eddy together, even as they struggle and clash on the surface.True jazz fans may find it the perfect riff on the basic gangster plot. The rest of us, perhaps, not so much."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/260cc61905db95d2c7a8762c782f2c0515218d53/0_111_4936_2963/master/4936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f42a7ee352f4547cecd521d0522e037","title":"coronavirus california rural counties reopen","story":"The governor has called the region’s reopening ‘a big mistake’. But some residents oppose the state’s one-size-fits-all approachAlong Plumas Street in Yuba City, California, diners on Tuesday sat in restaurants, sipping their drinks and enjoying their meals. Women relaxed in cushy spa chairs as pedicurists massaged their legs. A hair stylist fluffed and blow-dried a client’s hair.Only the protective face masks on the food service workers – and the few shops that remained closed – hinted at the global pandemic gripping the rest of the state, which was still under the same stay-at-home order that has been in place since 19 March.California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, had begun the week with a cautious concession that after weeks under shutdown, some regions could begin to modify the order. Some retailers would be able to offer curbside pickup starting Friday – but for rural communities like Yuba and Sutter counties that have not seen the level of infection that other parts of the state have experienced, the governor’s cautious approach simply was not enough.On Monday, following the directive of their bi-county public health officer, Dr Phuong Luu, businesses across both counties that were deemed “lower-risk” reopened under certain modifications. After weeks of darkened windows and closed signs, residents were once again flocking to their favorite gyms, salons, tattoo parlors and sit-down eateries.Many in these counties argue that a one-size-fits-all approach from Sacramento too often ignores the needs of rural communities in favor of population centers like Los Angeles and San Francisco.“You can’t paint us with the same paintbrush that you’re going to paint San Francisco and San Diego and Sacramento with,” said the Sutter county lawmaker Mike Ziegenmeyer. “That’s just not fair.”Yuba and Sutter are located just north of Sacramento, but a few minutes’ drive from the state capital, the region’s agriculture overtakes the scenery. Miles of orchards, plowed fields, flooded rice paddies and cow pastures separate Sacramento and Yuba City, the county seat of Sutter, and Marysville, the county seat of Yuba, located just over the Feather River from Yuba City.Just more than 78,000 live in Yuba while almost 97,000 live in Sutter, with more than two-thirds of the county population residing in Yuba City. Since the pandemic reached California, the two counties have reported 50 cases and three deaths. California in total has seen 58,815 cases, with 2,412 deaths as of Thursday. The six Bay Area counties that were the first in the country to issue a stay-at-home order have had more than 8,100 cases, while Los Angeles county’s more than 28,000 cases have led to more than half of the state’s deaths.For three weeks before Luu issued her reopening order, the rate of new cases in Yuba and Sutter plateaued, she said. In the more populated counties around Yuba and Sutter, the rate has plateaued for almost two weeks.Many in the county have attributed the low rate of infection to rural living – with fewer people who live further away from one another, the chances of spreading the virus are lowered. But with rural living comes a different set of needs. There’s more of a sense of isolation when sheltering in place. With fewer businesses open, fewer supplies are available. And perhaps most daunting in counties like Yuba and Sutter is the question of the economy.More than a third of the civilian labor force work farm jobs, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Of the remaining workforce, only about 3,600 work the information or professional and business services jobs that allow for telecommuting.Luu said as a public health official, she had to consider “the totality of health for the entire community”.“Covid-19 is dangerous and scary but it is not the only health issue,” Luu said in a statement. “We cannot wait for a vaccine without seeing extreme economic damage done to our community. The consequences of waiting will be additional health concerns brought on by stress and the very real dilemma for those with limited resources whether to buy life-saving food or life-saving medicines.”By Wednesday, Luu was issuing a warning to the Yuba and Sutter business community, warning them about not following the social distancing and protective gear guidelines she had put in place for the counties’ reopening. “It has become clear a number of businesses are not enacting required protocols to ensure the safety of the community,” she wrote. “I understand that some of your customers may strongly object to a facial covering requirement, but the long-term safety of our community is at stake. We do not want to take any steps back in our phasing-in efforts.”In Yuba City and Marysville on Tuesday, few customers wore masks when they entered stores or strolled along the sidewalks. But several businesses took Luu’s guidelines to heart.The waitstaff at the Happy Viking sports bar wore face masks and gloves and were strict about how many people they allowed inside at a time. While diners sat at tables spaced feet apart from each other inside the restaurant, those waiting outside to be seated bunched up by the door.“We’re still smoothing stuff out,” said Sandy Drown, who has owned the Happy Viking with her husband for 12 years.She rehired all of them this week.At the Training Zone in Marysville, staff stood at the front to remind entering gym members that they had wear face masks while working out. In addition to spacing out all the equipment and limiting capacity to 75 members at a time, the owner, Chris Gill, hired more cleaning staff and cut hours to fit in extra cleaning.“We really respect what the county did and kind of going out on a limb for us,” he said. “That’s why we’re taking the precautions and following the guidelines really, really strictly.”In the past few days, his staff has taken a number of calls from prospective members wanting to sign up because their gym still wasn’t open, Gill said. They have also taken a number from members who wanted to freeze their accounts because they were not comfortable returning just yet.Melissa Poma, owner of Melissa Poma Hair Salon in Yuba City, has been contacted nonstop by new clientele. On Monday, the first day of the reopening, she said it was like a scene out of a zombie movie, people coming up to her window just in shock to see someone cutting hair again. She received an inquiry from a woman who lived a few hours away but was so desperate for a haircut that she was willing to drive in.The problem is, Poma said, she needs to be careful. Even though she burned through her savings during the closure and could use the extra income, she is only taking clients that she knows and can be honest with when it comes to their health. “I have a child,” she said. “If my child is in the hospital, I’m not going to be there with him. I have a mother, I have a grandmother. I’m taking it very seriously.”Though she’s getting in what work that she can, Poma doesn’t think the counties’ reopening will be long-term. “There’s no way we can go by the health regulations in this industry,” she said. “I don’t know how to do a six-foot-away haircut.” Like others, Poma is conflicted.“It’s rough,” she said. “Our country worships the money god so much that we will put our health on the back burner. But livelihoods, people are closing down. I can’t imagine if you don’t have any sort of anything to fall back on.”She knows too that by operating while the state’s order is still in effect, she risks the state taking away her license. Already this week, the state regulatory boards have begun flexing in the rural communities that reopened early. On Tuesday, state alcoholic beverage control officials were in Yuba and Sutter, asking licensed locations to shift to takeout dining, and to close in-house dining voluntarily. John Carr, a spokesman for the state agency, said while agents could discipline and file administrative action against businesses that do not comply with their requests, “we hope for voluntary compliance.”Newsom could choose to enforce the state order more stringently in the coming days. Previously, he’s leaned toward education rather than enforcement, but when photos of packed beaches in southern California made headlines around the country, he ordered all beaches in Orange county closed for a weekend. Even then, however, law enforcement aimed not to arrest people violating the order.Across the state, cases have continued to rise incrementally, but numbers have not reached the doomsday predictions initially projected by state experts. As of Thursday, only 3,334 patients with confirmed cases were hospitalized statewide, along with 1,347 with suspected cases. State health officials have repeatedly pleaded with Californians, however, not to become complacent with their efforts, and to recognize that it is because of their actions that the numbers are where they are.For some in communities like Yuba and Sutter, however, the state is taking it too far. “I feel like the state’s a little overdramatic,” said Steve Lewis, a tattoo artist at Artistic Temple Social Club in Marysville. After weeks of no work, Lewis is just happy he can pay his bills again.“I have a lot of friends in this industry in other parts of the state who are in the same boat I was in just last week, and they’re just trying to get through, selling art, trying to do gift cards, doing GoFundMes,” he said. “I can work again. They can’t. I see everyone else in that position, and it’s a rough thing. I’m very grateful.”Newsom often refers to California as a “nation-state” in his daily briefings, to give “a sense of the scale and scope” of a state with the world’s fifth-largest economy and a population of almost 40 million.“We recognize that one size does not fit all,” he said. “You can’t manage a state this large, this erse in every way, shape or form ethnically, racially, religiously, on the basis of geography, without recognizing a bottom-up construct.”But he has repeatedly stressed that California must be united in its response against coronavirus.In that regard, the governor and Ziegenmeyer, the Sutter county lawmaker, are in agreement. “This is the way I look at it, and the way I hope he looks at it: we’re all a team in this in the state of California,” Ziegenmeyer said. But in rural California reopening, he sees not risk but economic potential.“If one small region can get back to work, think about the impact we’re going to have on the unemployment lines,” he said. “To me, that right there, opening up with the direction of a good health doctor who is going by the science and the numbers, that is huge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9fa5918420c84c5fe1e4de725385180299b92e0/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=635ae56dd2715fcaf8a6b37f9f51dd70","title":"coronavirus face mask exercise outside","story":"It’s important to get fresh air and exercise – but do we need to wear masks while running, walking and cycling?

While the CDC doesn’t list the outdoors as a high-density space, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s OK to exercise outdoors mask-free.Because breathing harder may release more virus into the air, Ben Levine, physician and director of the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, told NPR we should double our distance while exercising outside.Alex McDonald In short, yes. Taking deeper and harder breaths when exercising likely causes more viral shedding, especially if exercising outside where the wind can blow and dissipate the virus. Taking that into consideration, it is likely that due to increased viral shedding iniduals that are exercising should probably be more than 6ft apart.Jessalyn Adam We don’t have an answer. The recommendation of staying at least 6ft apart under normal circumstances is actually based on what we know about the flu. While coronavirus behaves differently, we’re doing our best to make inferences.That said, experts are recommending that while running you stay at least 13ft away from others. To minimize the risk as much as you can, put as much space between yourself and others as possible while biking.Adam If you’re totally alone or just with people from your own household then that’s fine to go without. However, if there are other people on the trail, wear your mask as you approach and while passing and do your best to try to put as much space as you can between you and the other person. If the terrain doesn’t allow you to put a lot of distance between yourself and the other person, turn away while passing so you’re breathing in the opposite direction.If you’re just passing another person and particularly if you’re just walking and not breathing heavily then I think it’s pretty low-risk.Kelley Vargo The purpose of the mask is more to prevent you from spreading the virus as opposed to keeping you from getting it. If you are feeling sick or “off” you should forgo going on a public trail. Consider exercising at home until you’re feeling OK, because this isn’t just about protecting yourself from the virus – we also don’t want to infect other people.Vargo Training with a mask, especially a homemade mask or an N95 mask will not replicate the effects of altitude training. If you really want to get an edge on your cardiovascular performance as it relates to altitude training, you should train at high altitude.Responses were edited for length and clarity"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We’d like to hear from those who attended events between the end of February and early March such as Wolves v Eyol and Cheltenham FestivalWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead between the end of February and the first couple of weeks in March.

Yet their disappointment is tempered by the same stoicism that got them through the war.“I can’t tell you how disappointed I am,” said Marie Scott, 93, who as a 17-year-old wireless operator heard first-hand the “bombs, gunfire, shouting and mayhem” of the D-day landings over the telephone in Portsmouth. “But in the present circumstances I think: what am I moaning about? All I’ve got is disappointment, whereas a lot of people have got far, far worse.”Scott, a retired secretary and grandmother, should have been in the Netherlands this week with the Taxi Charity for Military Veterans, marking Dutch Freedom day with others. There was to have been a parade, too, in central London, and a service at Westminster Abbey, followed by afternoon tea in a hotel and a meeting with old comrades, she said.She joined the million-strong crowd in central London on VE Day “where you were swept up with this sense of excitement and exhilaration”. “There was lots of hugging and kissing, all totally indiscriminate”. She remembers being alarmed by the density of the crowd, and fearful of being crushed.Now, on Friday, “I will probably be alone,” she said, “ though there will be masses of phone calls, and I’ve got my tiny little union jack.” At the end of the two minutes silence, at her flat near New Malden, south-west London, she intends to “raise a glass of something pleasant”.Ron Johnson, 98, from Shrivenham, near Swindon, was also expecting to be in Wageningen, in the Netherlands, with the Taxi Charity for Military Veterans, where he and other veterans would have be cheered by tens of thousands on Freedom Day. The retired businessman and grandfather has been before, “and it’s the most terrific experience, with people coming up to shake your hands.”“But, it’s gone. Kaput. It’s completely understandable. The world has shut down because of this virus,” said Johnson, an infantry officer with the Essex Regiment, then a glider pilot, who survived the bloody Battle of Arnhem despite being wounded by mortar fire and hit by a sniper’s bullet.Taken prisoner, he spent six months on a near starvation diet at Spangenberg Castle camp, then escaped when the Germans marched them out, and hid in hills for eight days until he was picked up by Americans. He arrived home in Grays, Essex, two days before VE Day.“On VE Day I got dressed up in service dress and headed into London, feeling smart though a bit thin and worn through lack of food.” He headed to Buckingham Palace, then he and two comrades went to a pub, in the company of “three young ladies from Scotland”.He thinks he will spend the anniversary mainly alone, although his daughter will visit. “And I shall be thinking chiefly about the terrible loss at Arnhem, which was really shocking, but not to dwell on it or to be too sad,” he said. He hopes to visit the Netherlands again in the future. “But, I’m 98 now, and it might have been my last opportunity.”Jim Healy, 95, a D-day veteran, missed VE Day as he was onboard HMS Persimmon in Bombay’s docks, preparing to head to Burma and “have a go at the Japanese”.“It was half-time for us,” said Healy, a former Royal Marine and retired printer from Middleton, Manchester, who lives alone.“The announcement came over the tannoy from the prime minister that they’d surrendered. It was quite joyful, to say the least.” They had to wait until the following day for their rum ration, “then it was quite a noisy party, but we were brought down to earth very rapidly because we were preparing for Burma.”He was to have been in London on Friday for the Royal British Legion celebrations and parade. Instead, his family will pay a distanced garden visit, and he plans to join the national singalong of We’ll Meet Again.“It would have been a joyful day. We missed the celebrations on VE Day, but saw pictures of people going mad in Manchester, London and Liverpool. I was looking forward to the anniversary. It would make up for what we missed when we were in India,” he said.For Jack Bracewell, 97, VE Day was spent in Schleswig-Holstein, in northern Germany. The following day, while visiting the house of a German family he had befriended, the door opened and the couple’s son entered in German uniform. No longer enemies, the two men shared “several drinks”. “It was over. And he was just another soldier,” recalled Bracewell, a D-day driver with the Royal Armoured Service Corps who experienced heavy fighting in Caen and at the Battle of Falaise.The retired driver, from Morecambe Bay, Lancashire, had hoped to attend three days of celebrations in London organised by the Royal British Legion. But his daughter and her husband, with whom he lives, are still pulling out all the stops.There will be bunting, bubbly, afternoon tea on the front lawn and 1940s music. Bracewell intends to wear a union jack sequinned bow tie. And though he can’t see his old comrades in the flesh, they will catch up on the day through video calls. “I’d love to have seen them. We were brothers. But, we can’t risk it with this virus,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7deff1f916b5bc20d3b11dcab7e32c55b63503ae/0_29_5568_3344/master/5568.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=325cd4ee208ed9dd050cb17fee76e5d5","title":"ve day 75 timetable prince charles to lead event with two minute silence","story":"Prince will read from George VI’s diary, followed by doorstep singalong, Churchill speech and Captain Tom documentaryThe Prince of Wales is to lead the nation’s two-minute silence to mark the 75th anniversary of the ending of the second world war in Europe.Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall will pay their respects from Scotland at 11am on a day of celebration and commemoration that also includes an address by the Queen and a national singalong of the wartime classic We’ll Meet Again.Charles will later read extracts from the diary of his grandfather, George VI, written on 8 May 1945, to be broadcast on BBC One during the afternoon.

Clear of Covid-19, strict protective measures are in placeby  Libby Brooks. Photographs by  Murdo MacLeodThe 44 residents and 90 staff of David Walker Gardens, a purpose-built facility for older people managed by South Lanarkshire Council, have faced significant restrictions since lockdown began but it hasn’t stopped them getting ready for today’s celebrations.“We celebrate life to the full each and every day, and regardless of the current challenges worldwide, we will continue to reminisce about days gone by and, more importantly, look to the future,” says Debra Allison, the unit manager.Staff collected wartime memorabilia from residents, laminating old photographs and hanging them across the garden, along with cut-outs of fighter planes and soldiers. Bunting flutters in the sunshine and an arch of red, white and blue balloons soars over the fish pond.As part of a new daily routine created to help residents through lockdown, the care home holds a morale-boosting song and dance event each day at 2.30pm. Rock Around the Pond brings those who are able out into the garden – which has been marked up to allow for socially distanced dancing – while others watch and sing along from their balconies. The home has fortunately avoided any coronavirus infection so far and strict preventative measures are in place. Deep cleaning – disinfectant electrostatic spraying – has been implemented as an extra precaution.Staff wear PPE, social distancing is in force and the main dining room is out of use. Residents avoid congregating, eating in smaller sitting rooms or their own rooms.Lockdown also means the only visitors allowed are coming to see loved ones who are dying. This is especially hard for a care home that prides itself in being as open as possible to the world beyond its walls. As Allison puts it, “Just because you’re living in a care environment doesn’t mean you have left the community.” The ground floor is known as the Street because that’s where people tend to mingle. Again, staff have thought creatively: for Mother’s Day, they held an impromptu concert with speakers playing music outdoors, which allowed visitors to speak to relatives over the garden fence. Allison remains optimistic about staff and residents’ capacity to cope with the inevitable challenges brought about by the pandemic. “In a care home, you are continually facing life’s challenges, as well as those in death. This is what we do.”These photographs were taken without entering the home, either through closed windows, or through open French windows while at a safe distance in the garden. Prior consent was given by service users, care home management and South Lanarkshire Council."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc39b8622c1e5e449d46452fbb35298c1cbc4b39/0_207_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=6f32065c0e61d06e6be2f537f2d8d0b9","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance 8 may","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:The number of new coronavirus cases in Russia rose by 10,699 over the past 24 hours, bringing the nationwide tally to 187,859, the coronavirus crisis response centre said on Friday.

Invade a foreign country you know little about. Abduct its president to the US. Collect a $15m bounty from the US government – and maybe an even bigger payoff from the people who then seize power.The plan to overthrow Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and bundle him off to Florida to face drug trafficking charges seemed foolproof to a former US army staff sergeant, Jordan Goudreau, as he mapped it out in a luxury Miami apartment in late 2019. The 43-year-old Canadian-American was certain his years as a green beret in Iraq and Afghanistan had prepared him for the task.And for the opponents of Maduro he was addressing, it must have sounded convincing – even after the failure of a previous coup attempt in 2019.Representatives of Juan Guaidó – the opposition leader recognised as Venezuela’s legitimate president by the US and most of its allies – signed a fat contract engaging Goudreau to overthrow Maduro.But in interviews with the , a senior opposition figure said they grew to doubt Goudreau and eventually broke with him months before he launched a disastrous raid this week that echoed the botched 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba.The flaws in his plan were laid bare as two bedraggled ex-US special forces soldiers were paraded alongside other members of the ragged invasion force. Airan Berry and Luke Denman were captured at sea before they even set foot on Venezuelan soil.Eight people were reported killed in the botched invasion and more than 100 others arrested. Berry and Denman later appeared on Venezuelan state television outlining the supposed plan to seize the presidential palace and whisk Maduro to the US.Goudreau announced what he called a “daring, amphibious raid” on Sunday afternoon. It was codenamed Operation Gideon after a biblical story symbolising the victory of a small military against a much stronger opponent.“Our units have been activated in the south, west and in the east of Venezuela,” he said, dressed in a golf shirt and standing next to a former Venezuelan national guard captain wearing body armour, Javier Nieto Quintero.But by then the plot had already fallen apart, not least because two days earlier the Associated Press had published a long investigation exposing the plan. If the AP knew it is likely the Venezuelan government did too.Goudreau served in the Canadian military in the 1990s and studied at the University of Calgary before joining the US green berets. He spent 15 years as a medical sergeant, doing several stints in Iraq and Afghanistan.After leaving the military Goudreau founded a security contractor, Silvercorp USA, in 2018. The company’s original plan was to provide guards to protect American schools from mass shootings.Silvercorp’s website trumpets a series of overblown claims including that Goudreau led “international security teams for the President of the United States” (he had provided private security at Trump political rallies).Early in 2019 Goudreau was providing security for a concert in aid of Venezuelan refugees on the Colombian border organised by Richard Branson, the billionaire owner of the Virgin conglomerate. There he met Cliver Alcalá, a Venezuelan former general who defected to the opposition. The pair began talking about how to overthrow Maduro.By September the plotting had progressed to a meeting in Miami between Goudreau and Juan José Rendón, a Venezuelan exile appointed by Guaidó to strategise ways of taking power.Rendón was well known in Latin American politics. He resigned as a strategist in then-Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos’s re-election campaigns amid allegations that he accepted bribes from drug lords. He was also accused of attempting to manipulate Mexico’s 2012 election. He has strongly denied both allegations.Guaidó had set up an advisory group to brainstorm ways to end the Maduro regime. Rendón’s job was to advise the commission on how to make that happen.He said the commission explored all legal means of ousting Maduro, including piracy laws. The commission also interviewed security consultants, mostly ex-soldiers offering specialist services for astronomical fees.“There were no limits – $1bn, $1.5bn,” Rendón told the .Goudreau’s firm was asking for far less – about $213m from Venezuela’s future oil earnings and a $1.5m retainer.“He was supposedly preparing something in Venezuela that would have gone through the Colombian border,” Rendón said.Goudreau told the Venezuelans he had 800 men ready to invade.A handful of meetings resulted in an agreement in October for “an operation to capturedetainremove Nicolás Maduro … remove the current regime and install the recognized Venezuelan President Juan Guaidó”.Goudreau has made public pages from the agreement – one of them ostensibly signed by Guaidó. The would-be president has said that it is not his signature and has previously denied any involvement..Rendón took the relationship seriously enough to pay Goudreau $50,000 of his own money to cover expenses. “He complained to me that I was a wealthy person and he was not and he was spending money,” Rendón said.Under the agreement Silvercorp had 45 days to train and equip the invasion force before teams of men would infiltrate Venezuela to seize key locations and buildings, and encourage a general uprising.But Rendón soon came to doubt that Goudreau had the military resources or competence he claimed, and grew concerned by his erratic behaviour – including his repeated demands for money.Rendón showed the  copies of increasingly angry texts he said were from Goudreau, demanding a $1.5m advance. “I will get the 1.5 the legal way. What a shame,” one text said. “We gave this to you on a silver platter and you fucked the whole thing up.”“Your credibility in DC because of this is gone,” another text said. “You are a multimillionaire. Shame on you for not fixing your country. You don’t deserve to live in the USA.”Neither Goudreau nor his lawyer returned calls seeking comment.As the abortive raid was under way, Goudreau told Factores de Poder, a Miami-based Youtube channel: “They kept promising to pay week after week. So that lasted about a month but then we kind of realised that nothing was going to happen.”Rendón said he lost confidence in Goudreau because of his “character, his moods” and “lack of respect”. He said Guaidó also began to suspect that Goudreau was talking too much.“He was meeting with people in Colombia before meeting with us that were related to groups that we don’t engage with – because they are related to the regime,” said Rendón.The dispute over the $1.5m retainer came to a head in a blazing row in November when Goudreau, Nieto and other exiles confronted Rendón at his Miami apartment.“That conversation got heated, heated, heated and at the end Nieto intervened and we went to my balcony to chill,” Rendón said.Goudreau left without his money. Rendón said he heard nothing more until April when he received a lawyer’s letter demanding payment of the $1.5m.Rendón was not the first person to back away from a deal with Goudreau. Drew White, who served with Goudreau, Berry and Denman in the Middle East, helped set up Silvercorp. But he pulled out in 2019 when Goudreau started cooking up the plan to abduct Maduro, deciding it was too far fetched.“As supportive as you want to be as a friend, his head wasn’t in the world of reality,” White told the Associated Press. “Nothing he said lined up.”Ephraim Mattos, a former US navy Seal, who trained some of the would-be combatants in tactical medicine, told the Wall Street Journal he had tried to stop the operation.Goudreau decided to press ahead anyway.Preparations on the ground began to unravel in late March when Colombian police stopped Jorge Alberto Molinares driving along the Caribbean coast. His Renault Duster was packed with assault rifles, flak jackets and military helmets he was moving to a safe house in Riohacha, 55 miles from the Venezuelan border.The authorities had begun watching the house after the landlord complained that the plotters had missed rent payments. Molinares told investigators he was delivering the shipment to a man known as to “El Pantera”, or the Panther, who Venezuelan authorities said was Robert Levin Colina Ibarra – subsequently killed in the botched invasion.Goudreau’s plans were further complicated when his ally Alcalá, the former general, was indicted on the same drug trafficking charges as Maduro is facing. Before turning himself over to authorities Alcalá told the  that he was working with the knowledge of “American contractors and the Colombian government” though he would not go into further details.Unveiling the indictments in March, US authorities also offered a $15m reward for information leading to Maduro’s capture and prosecution.With the big payoff agreed with Rendón dead, that made a potential payout from the US government all the more important for Goudreau. (The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, raised eyebrows this week by denying “direct” involvement in the plot.) Berry, one of the captured American mercenaries, told state television that the plan was to abduct the president from his 19th-century official palace in the heart of Caracas, although he was uncertain how they wold carry that off. Denman told television that he was to secure a nearby military airport and bring in planes to carry Maduro out.After the would-be liberators of Venezuela were herded ashore on Sunday, Maduro claimed that his agents had infiltrated the operation long ago and were ready to pounce. “We knew everything,” he said. “What they ate, what they didn’t eat. What they drank. Who financed them.”Guaidó said that if the Venezuelan president let the operation go ahead in that knowledge, he had blood on his hands. “Nicolás Maduro you are responsible. They knew about the operation, they infiltrated them and waited for them to massacre them,” he said.Goudreau sounded more sanguine even as Operation Gideon collapsed around him.“I’m out a lot of money, a lot,” he said this week. “A lot of us came together to do this. I’ve been a freedom fighter my whole life. This is all I know.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d584a698b4d25fcd2c2157c506f482fd1dd3079/0_358_5100_3061/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96b3b3feb8e55ea90ed57e6985370665","title":"how are you marking the 75th anniversary of ve day in lockdown","story":"We’d like to hear from people about how you’re remembering the anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe Friday 8 May will mark 75 years since the end of the Second World War in Europe.

We’re fed up. This has got to end.”As of Thursday, there were 2,757 confirmed cases for the Navajo Nation – whose rural territory stretches 27,000 square miles over the south-western Colorado plateau across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. The official death toll stood at 88 – higher than 13 states – though the actual number of fatalities is likely to be much higher as the sickest patients requiring ventilators and intensive care are transferred to state hospitals.The virus has spread rapidly among the Navajo since the first case was confirmed at the end of March, even though the tribal government was among the first to issue a stay-at-home order, lock down schools and business, and impose evening and weekend curfews.Despite the unfolding crisis, it wasn’t until Wednesday that the Nation received its portion, around $600m, of federal coronavirus relief funding. It came six weeks after it was promised and a week after the government missed a congressional deadline for distribution, and only after being sued over who is eligible for the money.“We don’t have the resources of New York and New Jersey and yet it’s taken six weeks for tribes to see this money,” said Nez. “The federal response has been too slow.”This slow, inadequate response by the government is nothing new.The US has repeatedly violated its treaty obligations by failing to adequately fund healthcare, education, housing, economic development and agricultural assistance for tribal nations, according to the National Congress of American Indians.As a result, the Navajo Nation is beset with widespread structural, economic and health injustices which have helped coronavirus spread and hampered efforts to curtail it.Take housing. It’s been extremely challenging to quarantine infected iniduals because of inadequate basic infrastructure and widespread overcrowding, according to tribal council delegate Amber Kanazbah Crotty.In part, the latter is down to cultural norms which mean multiple generations often live together, but it’s also due to chronic housing shortages, complex federal restrictions on construction, high unemployment and poverty on the reservation.“We don’t have enough hospital beds for iniduals to recover, so we’ve had to send people home where the virus is spread,” said Nez. After multiple family outbreaks, up to 150 coronavirus patients will now be temporarily housed in three converted community gyms, instead of being sent home.“Social distancing isn’t simple, when people have to move to survive,” said Kanazbah Crotty.As a result, the average age for coronavirus cases among the Navajo is just 45 years old, according to Crystalyne Curley, spokeswoman for the operational command centre.Unsurprisingly perhaps, the lack of running water increases the risk of infectious diseases. But the crisis is also linked to childhood obesity – the number one risk factor for type 2 diabetes, which is seven times more common in native youth than the general population, according to Dr Allison Barlow, CAIH director.“The clash of historic traumas, accumulated stressors and poor social determinants cannot be underestimated in what we’re seeing now with coronavirus. There’s such a complex constellation of risks piled up and chronic underfunding is part of that puzzle,” said Barlow.According to Laura Gammitt, an infectious diseases specialist, the emerging epidemiological data suggests Covid-19 infections are more common and more severe in younger Navajo people than the general population. This is partly linked to underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and respiratory conditions – which are more prevalent among younger Native Americans than non-Natives. The average age of those who have died is 66 – significantly younger than in the US as a whole.The tribe continues to struggle to obtain enough testing kits and PPE, especially gowns and masks, and has been forced to rely on private donors including the actor Sean Penn. Contact tracing is also still very limited, though a training program is now under way.Still, Nez has come under pressure from some local mayors to reopen tourist attractions, as states look towards easing lockdown restrictions despite public health warningsNez added: “Lots of states are risking second spikes by not following professional advice. I love my people and we are not going to reopen prematurely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71f1295dfa24e9717c0823284152fba8747ef2d3/0_58_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0c0c692cd9897244af84eb17dfda1de3","title":"pinochet great niece chile womens minister","story":"Macarena Santelices has praised the ‘good side’ of the 1973-90 dictatorship in which over 300 women were raped under tortureChile’s rightwing president, Sebastián Piñera, has prompted a firestorm of criticism after naming an open supporter of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship as the country’s new minister for women’s rights and gender equality.Controversy over the appointment of Macarena Santelices – who is also the dictators’s great-niece – has focused on a 2016 interview in which she praised the “good side” of the 1973-90 dictatorship in which more than 3,000 people were murdered or disappeared by security forces and many thousands more imprisoned and tortured.She also came under criticism for her outspoken comments against immigrants.Taking office on Wednesday, Santelices denied she had ever “endorsed or justified” human rights violations and appealed to Chileans to “judge me on what I do from today onwards, as a woman”.But activists said her comments about the period of military rule – during which at least 316 women were raped while under torture, 11 of whom were pregnant – were entirely incompatible with her new role.“This appointment is a flagrant provocation and demonstrates the government’s total disdain for what the Chilean feminist movement is demanding,” said Romina Parada, co-founder of the feminist collective Baila Capucha Baila.“As far as our collective are concerned, we still don’t have a minister for women’s rights and gender equality,” she said.Santelices studied journalism and worked for several national media outlets before becoming the mayor of Olmué, a small town in the lush valleys of central Chile, in 2012.She resigned in October 2019 to run for the governorship of Valparaíso under the banner of the rightwing Independent Democratic Union – a party founded in 1983 to preserve the political and economic legacy of the dictatorship.The post had been vacant for 54 days since Santelices’s predecessor, Isabel Plá, resigned after months of criticism that she had been ineffectual in the role.“We are extremely concerned by the government’s continued appointments of non-specialist ministers who are wholly unqualified and unprepared for this role,” lamented Bárbara Sepúlveda, the executive director of Chile’s association of feminist lawyers.“This is a decisive step backwards for women’s rights and sexual ersity in Chile – it cannot be the case that civil society organisations such as ours continue to bear the weight of upholding the country’s commitment to international human rights standards,” she said.Santelices’s appointment comes amid a growing wave of women’s activism in Chile, two months after more than a million women marched in Santiago on International Women’s Day.In March, Piñera signed a new law that broadened the definition of femicide to include perpetrators known to the victim rather than just formal partners or cohabiters.“During a period in which patriarchal violence has increased, the president has appointed somebody with no experience or training in gender issues,” explained Javiera Manzi, a spokeswoman for the Coordinadora Feminista 8M organisation.“We will not allow a person who embodies everything we stand against to lead this ministry, and as such demand her immediate removal from the role.”The hashtag #WeHaveNoMinister has trended on social media since her appointment and several other feminist and transgender rights organisations – including Sepúlveda and Parada’s collectives – have joined calls for Santelices’s resignation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22dd4d3858aa30e03bd76081ca9f03f4e18fb16c/0_46_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80a83d3ab52cd38c6b06ae7737ddeadb","title":"raf jets to roar over uk to mark 75th anniversary of ve day","story":"Boris Johnson urges nation to unite in tribute as celebrations are adapted owing to Covid-19RAF jets will roar over Britain to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day, as Boris Johnson urged the nation to unite in tribute to the achievement and sacrifice of the wartime generation.The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall will lead a two-minute silence from Scotland on a day of celebration and commemoration which also includes a “national toast”, an address by the Queen, and a nationwide sing-a-long of Vera Lynn’s We’ll Meet Again.Original plans for VE Day 75 were cancelled due to Covid-19, so national events have been adapted. The public in lockdown is encouraged to celebrate Victory in Europe from their gardens, doorsteps and living rooms.The prime minister said: “Seventy-five years ago today, the people of this country celebrated victory against Hitler’s aggression.“On the frontline, they fought with courage, ingenuity and endurance, and on the home front, women defended our cities against air raids, worked the factories, and ran the hospitals.“This country triumphed thanks to the heroism of countless ordinary people, and because of this, hundreds of millions of people now live in peace and freedom today.“Today we must celebrate their achievement, and we remember their sacrifice.“We are a free people because of everything our veterans did – we offer our gratitude, our heartfelt thanks and our solemn pledge: you will always be remembered.”Johnson visited Westminster Abbey on Thursday to pay his respects, and will observe Friday’s two-minute silence from Downing Street, from where he will also speak with second world war veterans via video call.The Red Arrows will perform a flypast over London, while modern RAF Typhoon jets will appear over Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. Air Chief Marshal Mike Wigston said: “We want these flypasts to lift eyes and spirits in celebration of peace in Europe 75 years ago today. We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to that generation of heroes, from all backgrounds and many countries, who gave so much to defend the United Kingdom and free Europe from Nazi tyranny.”Royal Navy warships and support vessels for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary at home and deployed around the world will blast their sirens for a minute to celebrate victory, marking the moment of Winston Churchill’s address at 3pm.The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said: “Although we cannot celebrate that precious connection with our veterans on the scale we had planned, we should all pause and reflect on their inspirational achievement. As Churchill said, ‘God bless you all, this is your victory’.”During the day, special television and radio programmes will include the broadcast of Churchill’s historic victory speech and Prince Charles reading extracts from the diary of his grandfather, George VI, written on 8 May 1945.

Not only has the US suffered the most deaths worldwide, at more than 75,000 people so far, it has also failed so far to bend the curve of infections downwards.The US peaked at around 30,000 new confirmed Covid-19 cases a day in April but rather than this rate sharply dropping, it has simply plateaued. Outside New York, a global hotspot for the pandemic that has managed to bend its curve downwards after weeks of societal restrictions, the rate of new cases is actually climbing in America.Comparing the journey of the pandemic in the US with other nations is instructive – while new cases and deaths in Italy, Spain and France rocketed, they then plunged back down to more manageable levels ahead of plans to restart the patterns of normal life. The trend lines in the US show sharp climbs before a flattening to a stagnation, rather than quick decrease.Public health experts have warned that the US is at risk of prematurely removing social distancing restrictions and encouraging a second, stronger wave of infections. One disaster management specialist has said the reopening of several states, devoid of the mass public testing required to safely do so, will hand a “death sentence” to many more Americans."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4248404.1588938673!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cancelling the leaving cert i can finally breathe","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe 2020 Leaving Cert exams are set to be cancelled and replaced with a “Plan B” in which students will be awarded grades based on their classwork Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe  After months of uncertainty it has emerged that the 2020 Leaving Certificate examinations are set to be cancelled. Students will be awarded predictive grades based on their classwork instead and those students who are unhappy with their graded results may be able to sit the exams at a later stage. We asked readers for their views. The following is a selection of the responses we received.Caoimhe Culleton, County Dublin My eldest daughter who is 19 was to sit her Leaving Cert this June. She has a love of the Irish language and had visited the Gaeltacht for the past 6 years so the first blow was the cancellation of the orals. The second blow comes today she has not stopped studying despite lockdown- up every morning hitting the books with a drive I respect and admire. Her school exams and mocks produced average results - the exams were an opportunity to move the grades up a notch - that is now lost. Her chance to go to Trinity does not seem achievable - I think the students most affected are the middle group who may have been borderline with their grades but needed higher points for their desired course. In addition, will the likes of the grind schools give all of their students H1’s to ensure success on the school league table? Where will be the fairness? But today we want closure- we are exhausted with the bickering of the politicians trying to score points with populist views - I am sad today with this outcome and the lost opportunity for so many students.Aimee Cosgrove, County Dublin I am extremely pleased with the cancellation of the Leaving Cert. Throughout my school career I have suffered with high anxiety due to having autism and generalised anxiety disorder. This anxiety has always spiked around exams and I have never performed to my full capacity. As you can imagine, my anxiety has been sky-high through the lockdown and there hasn’t been a time where I have taken a full deep breath and relaxed. The constant upset stomach has worn me down and I have recently barely managed to do one piece of work a day. I was reaching my breaking point and I could not continue for two more months. News of the cancellation has lifted a weight off of my shoulders. I can finally breathe and enjoy family time without the guilt of not studying. Now I feel as if all my hard work over the past two years will be accounted for and I will get the grades I deserve. I think they are choosing the fairest option that will help improve the mental health of students all over the country.Mary Brennan I’m a repeat student. I’ve only been in my school a few months. Predicted grades are the worst outcome for me. I can’t repeat again and they’re saying you won’t be able to sit exams until 2021.Marta Solli, Cork I personally think that using predictive grades is a much fairer choice. I worked hard for two years and I think that all my effort and hard work should be considered. Cancelling the Leaving Cert will definitely ease the stress all students are experiencing at the moment. We need to keep in mind that many sixth-year students might be stressed out for many reasons other than the exams. For example, I am an exchange student who spent the last two years in Ireland staying with a host family. My family lives in Italy, a country devastated by the coronavirus. I am, of course stressed out because of the whole situation beyond just the Leaving Cert. I live in a foreign country without my parents at the age of 17 and knowing that my relatives are in danger breaks my heart. I haven’t seen my parents in months and the only thing I want is to go home and spend time with them. Students who are not happy with their predicted grades will be free to sit the exams. Being able to choose means everyone will do what they think it’s best for them.Matthew Gardner, County Clare Somewhat disappointing that the Leaving Cert has been taken out of my hands. However, it seemed to me that this is the option that the majority of students I know had hoped for. The prospect of further delays and the air of uncertainty around the exams was causing a lot of stress for students. \u0026nbspAlthough I am not completely happy with the decision made, I understand that this was the best option and not everyone was going to be happy no matter what is decided. Despite its flaws I do believe this is the correct decision considering the circumstances of Covid-19.Kyle Murphy, Cork I believe that any decision made today will be a step in the right direction for this year’s exam. Being a sixth year student I am acutely aware of the stress and pressure that we experienced which has only increased with the global pandemic. I think that a predicted grades system would be the best way for the Leaving Cert this year as it minimises the risk of infection for 60 thousand students along with countless superintendents and staff. It also takes into account the mental health of the students after months of uncertainty.Damien Sloan, County Waterford My son is really upset. He studied hard all along and wanted his Leaving Cert mark based on exams as that’s what they had almost two years to prepare for it The not-so-conscientious ones want predicted grades as they haven’t done the work. All his friends want to sit the exams too.Daniel Reade, Dublin My name is Daniel and I’m a current Leaving Cert student. I haven’t had the most stereotypical journey through secondary level education, missing 1st and 2nd year due to a physical illness, and homeschooled for all of 3rd year. I have been attending school for 5th and 6th year but my attendance has varied from weeks of absence to half days. Again this is due to an ongoing physical illness and on top of that the stress and anxiety caused by the uncertainty of the current crisis, it is hindering my ability to focus at home. Thankfully my physical health is improving and I am able to put a lot more work into my studies than previous months. I think the Government has made the right decision in the best interest of the country’s physical health with the proposed cancellation of the exams. But it does leave me wondering what a fair alternative would be.\u0026nbspI personally am anxious as I haven’t been fully present for a lot of my time in secondary school, missing class tests and some exams. So my question to the Government is how are teachers going to fairly predict the grades of students like myself who haven’t been able to prove their capabilities throughout the last few years? Although this is a serious worry for me, all I want at the moment is clarity and certainty on the situation and for something to be sent in stone. I don’t envy the position of the Government in this present time but students have been waiting too long for decisions to be made that could affect their whole lives. Hopefully a plan of action will be decided upon in the coming days.Harry Willis I think that everyone should be given their first CAO preference. I know that would mean a lot of people who should not get their course will but at the end of the day if you’re not able for your course then you can’t blame the government. This way colleges still get fees, everyone is happy that they got their course and there will be no lengthy lawsuits taken against the government that the predicted grade received was wrong. It will only be a once off thing for a once off crisis.Sylvia Hart, County Dublin I don’t agree with predicted grades because how am I going to redeem myself without sitting the exam? I have been studying during quarantine and have improved so much. So when the results come out I wouldn’t be happy. And I’m not comfortable with the fact that my future is in the hands of a teacher. It is only the brightest students that want predicted grades because they know they would do well. I would say give students the option of sitting the exam or opting for predictive grades in July.Éabha Hughes, County Dublin The cancellation of exams was necessary, that much is clear. The majority of people wanted them replaced with predicted grades. However, there is still a minority that wanted the exams to go ahead - and they should be given the opportunity to do so. Sitting the exams if they don’t want their predicted grades should be an option. This can be done by following social distancing measures in August, especially seeing as there will over 75 per cent fewer students taking the exams, and with enough time to correct so everyone can start third level together. Pushing the re-sits out to as late as early 2021 is almost like punishing the students. I don’t understand why the Government can’t listen to what the students actually want - yes we want predicted grades, but we don’t want to see those unhappy left in the dust either. I don’t know if people have forgotten, but this is the biggest year of many of our lives so far, and with the emphasis put on the Leaving Cert throughout our young lives there is no doubt that some people are distraught and inconsolable over this decision.Barry Quinn, County Dublin I’m doing my Leaving Cert this summer and I’m an external candidate. Where does the decision leave me because I am not assessed on anything? I am not attending college, just sitting the exam on the day.Stephanie Murray While I believe that a system of predicted grades will be suitable in the vast majority of cases, there are a significant number of students who would be assessed on less than a years’ work- those repeating the leaving cert, those who missed fifth year due to illness, and those who transferred to grind schools for sixth year. For these students, it is imperative that exams take place, and preferably as soon as possible. Since the numbers of students opting to receive a predicted grade will significantly lower the number choosing to take an exam, it should not be impossible to hold socially distanced exams, in August, for example. This would enable those students who cannot rely on predicted grades to begin college this year. For those repeating the Leaving Cert, waiting until 2021 to begin their courses is demoralising and unfair.Leslie Hammond, County Dublin Am despairing at who is making the decisions with regard to the Leaving Cert. It makes no sense to have an option to sit at a much later date. Predicted results should easily be out by middleend June with those that aren’t happy sitting on 29th July. This is not rocket science! If a restaurant can open using socially distancing measures, exams can be held. The playing field needs to be level and fair, which won’t happen if some students aren’t happy with predicted grades and are expected to sit around for another 69 months before doing the Leaving Cert. Never mind the fact that it will just be adding more pressure on places next year as they will be competing with the current 5th years. Am despairing at who is running the show vis-à-vis the Leaving Cert.Ann Marie O’Dwyer At long last the students’ voice has been heard. Since 12th March when schools closed the Leaving Cert was compromised. The list of problems were endless, my daughter has been working hard since 5th year towards the exams in June, then suddenly online classes which didn’t happen. She only had one teacher who came on at class time to do her class. Teachers sent videos, most sent homework. She had four subjects not completed on 12th March including honours Maths, Physics, Geography and English. Teachers didn’t contact their students, didn’t correct homework. It became very disheartening but she continued on. Mr Varadkar’s “by hook or by crook” statement really upset her and she hoped that the Department of Education would clarify matters but things only got worse. At that stage she believed the only option was cancellation of the exam and predicted grades so she and her class could continue with their lives.Danielle Clarke, County Dublin This is highly irresponsible in the absence of the actual detail of the planEilisha Downes I am a Leaving Cert student and I think that the idea is brilliant and should have been done ages ago. All of this going back and forth, will itwon’t it, is unhelpful for students, teachers, parents and anyone else who might be involved. While I do agree with the cancellation, I am worried about my education next year as I am hoping to start a PLC in Galway this September but because of Covid-19 I never got the chance to interview which should have been held mid-May.\u0026nbspI am grateful to my teachers and the hard working men and women across the board who have helped to make my Leaving Cert year as close to normal as possible. They have all put in a huge amount of work and I am thankful (just don’t tell my teachers)Ryan Kelly, County Cork I am a Leaving Cert student and I believe that, although it’s not ideal, cancelling the Leaving Cert was the best option. We find ourselves in a situation that has never been seen before and in these extraordinary circumstances exceptions to the normal Leaving Cert should be expected. The pandemic has caused hardship and challenges for millions around the world. I don’t think it would have been possible, or at least feasible, to hold exams while the pandemic continued. There were too many possible problems that could not be accounted for and risking the health of our most vulnerable was not worth it when there were other options available. Furthermore I have great faith in our hardworking teachers across the country that they will provide fair results for their students. I feel an immense pressure lifted from me now that I can rest assured the work I’ve put in over the last two years will be accounted for and I do not have to carry the pressure until late July.Megan Ní Laighin The amount of stress this alternative will lift from students nationwide is simply phenomenal. I wouldn’t feel remotely comfortable participating in contact classes for two weeks prior to written exams seeing as both of my parents have underlying conditions. Overall, provided a reasonable alternative can be out in place, canceling the written Leaving Certificate exams in July is undoubtedly the right decision."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4247918.1588915652!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"car bans and pedestrianised college green part of radical covid 19 plan to re open dublin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIt is understood the measures will remain in place for at least 12 to 18 months, with some likely to be retained on a permanent basis. Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe Dublin’s College Green is set to be pedestrianised – and cars restricted throughout the city – under plans to reopen the city centre as Covid-19 restrictions are lifted.A joint report from Dublin City Council chief executive Owen Keegan and Brendan O’Brien of its traffic department said “the same level of vehicular traffic cannot be accommodated in the city as before”, and in a number of locations “motorised vehicles” would have to banned after 11am each day.The report describes the proposal as a “temporary mobility plan” which would be introduced over the next three to six months in line with the Government’s road map for reopening society, published last week.However, it is understood the measures will remain in place for at least 12 to 18 months, with some likely to be retained on a permanent basis.Some measures already undertaken by the council to increase space and social distancing for pedestrians, including priority setting on traffic lights to guard against footpath queueing, “actually preclude a return to previous high levels of private car use”, the report says.Last year 46,000 private cars travelled into the city centre during typical morning peak times. By March 31st that figure had dipped to around 14,000. However, the measures prioritising pedestrians at traffic lights would alone mean traffic would have to be reduced by 40 per cent on last year’s levels.Working groupA council and National Transport Authority working group has been established to oversee the changes. The report said changes may mean removing vehicles after 11am, “ which will assist businesses to reopen by allowing more on-street space for tables and chairs, and also for waiting areas”.“The temporary closure of College Green and the temporary widening of footpaths along Dame Street would provide space within the city centre for pedestrians, cyclists and for businesses to be facilitated to reopen.”A full report on the range and location of measures which will “reflect the new reality” will be published in the next two weeks. It will also include measures to widen footpaths on the main corridors, provide for cycling, ensure public transport is safe to use and providing increased space for boarding and alighting at bus stops in the city centre.“The requirements of social distancing, the reduction of emissions and the encouragement of the active modes require that our temporary mobility plan for the city is not based around any increase in private car traffic,” the report said.“The changes in our traffic light system to assist pedestrians and avoid build ups of pedestrians at crossings actually preclude a return to previous high levels of private car use.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4248363.1588932900!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sea level could rise 1m by 2100 if emissions targets missed experts","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are important indicators of climate change.

By surveying a wide range of leaders in the field, it offers broader assurance about its projections for the ranges of future sea-level rise, she explained.In a scenario where global warming is limited to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, the specialists estimated a rise of 0.5m by 2100 and 0.5 to 2m by 2300.In a high-emissions scenario with 4.5 degrees of warming, they estimated a larger rise of 0.6 to 1.3m by 2100 and 1.7 to 5.6m by 2300.Prof Benjamin Horton of NTU Singapore, who led the survey, said sea-level rise projections and knowledge of their uncertainties “are vital to make informed mitigation and adaptation decisions”.“The complexity of sea-level projections, and the sheer amount of relevant scientific publications, make it difficult for policymakers to get an overview of the state of the science,” he said.To obtain this overview, it was useful to survey leading experts on the expected sea-level rise, which provided a broader picture of future scenarios and informed policymakers so they could prepare necessary measures, Prof Horton said.StudyPublished in Nature Partner Journals Climate and Atmospheric Science, researchers from the University of Hong Kong Durham University (UK) Rowan University (US) Tufts University (US) and Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (Germany) contributed to the study.“We know that the planet will see additional sea-level rise in the future,” noted co-author Dr Andra Garner of Rowan University.“But there are stark differences in the amount of sea-level rise experts project for low emissions compared to high emissions. This provides a great deal of hope for the future, as well as a strong motivation to act now to avoid the more severe impacts of rising sea levels,” said Dr Garner.The experts were chosen as they were among the most active publishers of sea-level studies – at least six published papers in peer-reviewed journals since 2014 – and identified from a leading publication database.They identified the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets as “the greatest sources of uncertainty”. They are an important indicator of climate change and driver of sea-level rise. Satellite-based measurements show the ice sheets are melting at an accelerating rate. However, they also underlined the magnitude and impact of sea-level rise can be limited by successfully reducing emissions.Prof Andrea Dutton of the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US, who was not involved in this study, said: “One of the key takeaways is that our actions today can make a profound difference in how much our coastlines will retreat in the future. That knowledge is empowering because it means that we can choose a better outcome through our actions.”A separate study published this week shows coastal zones in Europe contain large human populations, significant socio-economic activities and assets, and fragile ecosystems and are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise of 1m or more.Coastal communities will face increasing risk of floods as climate change could cause extreme sea-level rise by 2100, it concludes. Coastal adaptation, however, could prevent 95 per cent of the projected economic losses.The findings are in an EU Joint Research Council study in Nature Communications. In the absence of climate action and with continued demographic pressure and urbanisation along coastlines, annual damages from coastal flooding in the EU and the UK “could increase sharply . . . to almost €1.6 trillion by 2100, with 3.9 million people exposed to coastal flooding every year”, it said."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

It has lasted 2,294 days and left much of the continent in ruins.The news was greeted with jubilation across the world and even with some relief in vanquished Germany. In London people congregated in Piccadilly Circus and danced around the Eros fountain. Bonfires were lit along the River Thames that evening. Prime Minister Winston Churchill declared that the following day would be Victory in Europe (VE) Day.New York’s Times Square was filled with hundreds of thousands of people and on the Hudson River liners and tugs sounded their horns.The news reached Ireland at 2pm via BBC radio. By 3pm students at Trinity College Dublin (TCD) climbed on to the roof of the building and raised the flags of the victors, the hammer and sickle of the Soviet Union, the French tricolour and at the top, and largest of all, the Union flag. Underneath them, the Irish tricolour was at the bottom of the mast trailing on the floor of the roof.The flag-raising ceremony attracted thousands of onlookers to College Green. Carried away with the exuberance of it all, some of the students on the roof started singing God Save the King\u0026nbspand Rule Britannia.The four flags were taken down after a while and replaced with the Stars and Stripes. The students on the roof burned the Irish tricolour and threw it on to the lawn beneath.News of the burning spread across the city. At the time TCD was regarded as a bastion of “west Brit” sentiment and of Protestantism, not helped by the prohibition on Catholics going to the college by the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin Dr John Charles McQuaid.University College Dublin (UCD), then based at Earlsfort Terrace, was its mirror opposite. The overwhelming majority of its students were from a nationalist and Catholic background.Counter demonstrationAmong them was an 18-year-old commerce student from Donnycarney called Charles J Haughey who had won a scholarship to UCD. Haughey was also a part-time second lieutenant in the reserve forces during the Emergency years. The platoon he set up was named “Haughey’s fusiliers”.Haughey is alleged to have been the ringleader of a counter demonstration which began in Middle Abbey Street at 8pm that evening. On their way to the meeting, they tore down a Union flag hanging on a lamppost at the bottom of Grafton Street and set it alight.After congregating in Middle Abbey Street, the mob then marched over O’Connell Bridge, breaking windows in the offices of The  in Fleet Street as they passed, the paper perceived to be pro-British.The  reported that the crowd which descended on Trinity were led by a “young man waving a large tricolour hoisted on the shoulders of his comrades” - since identified by some of his friends as Haughey.The gates of Trinity College were closed so the group tried to scale the railings of the university at which point they were set upon by gardaí who baton charged them and split more than a few heads. A dozen protesters were taken to hospital.The mob dispersed down College Green and attacked the doors of the Wicklow Hotel shouting “give us the west Britons” and “put out the traitors”.One of their number told The : “Trinity has insulted the country by burning the Tricolour. We don’t mind Trinity flying the Union Jack because we all know the outlook of these people, but what we do object is to the flying of a number of Irish flags insultingly on the bottom”.FitzGerald versus HaugheyAccording to Professor Gary Murphy of DCU who is familiar with the Haughey archive there is nothing specific in the papers relating to the VE incident beyond a cryptic line in a letter to his personal friend and Gate Theatre co-founder Micheál MacLiammóir just over 25 years later on September 22nd, 1970 when Haughey was on trial for his alleged role in arms importation. In turning down an invitation to dinner with MacLiammóir and his partner Hilton Edwards because of the trial, Haughey said “I have been dining out on the Trinity incident myself - suitably embellished of course”.One of the eyewitnesses to the events at Trinity College was Garret FitzGerald, another future taoiseach who would become Haughey’s long-time rival. He was in town celebrating VE Day when he heard about what was going on in College Green. He recalled Haughey escaping from gardaí by “jumping over bicycles and going up Trinity Street. My views and his views would have been different. I was strongly pro-Allied”.Contrary to what has been reported since, Haughey never did get to the top of Trinity to run the tricolour up the flagpole. Contemporary newspaper reports suggest that attempts by other students to storm the college were rebuffed successfully by gardaí.The story made the front page of most Irish newspapers including The .The edition of The  published on May 8th, 1945 proved to be one of the celebrated in the history of the newspaper.The editor Bertie Smyllie was strongly pro-British and bridled against the strict Irish government censorship of newspapers, especially The  which was minutely scrutinised by censors.He got his revenge by rearranging the front page of the newspaper to make a V for victory sign.“There was nothing the censor could do about it,” wrote Tony Gray, then a junior leader writer in the paper, in his book, Mr Smyllie, Sir. “In the final moment of victory, Smyllie had played the trump card.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4247919.1588884401!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"savvy diplomacy needed to achieve brexit talks extension coveney","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSimon Coveney said ‘the easy thing is just to call for an extension, but we do not get an extension unless the UK side wants to pursue that approach’.Ireland and the European Union need to be clever and diplomatic about the “ways and means” of achieving an extension to Brexit negotiations, Tánaiste Simon Coveney has told the Dáil.He said the British position was clear – they would not be seeking an extension and he acknowledged that they would need longer than the end of the year to achieve a proper deal.He warned that if they could not reach agreement because of the timelines “we have to have plans in place to try to protect Irish interests as best we can”.June is the deadline for agreement to extend the negotiating period but the United Kingdom has said it faces ending the transitional period at the end of this year, which would become the deadline for a trade deal.Opposition TDs called on the Government and European Union to ask the UK to extend negotiations because of the pressures involved and the coronavirus crisis.But speaking during a Dáil debate on Brexit, Mr Coveney said “the idea that the ask should come from Ireland or the EU, where it would be seen by the UK as a concession to the EU to agree to an extension, is not the way to approach this. We need to work to convince the UK that more time is needed to get a good deal for everybody, including the UK.”Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty said if the British position did not change they were potentially looking at a Cabinet subcommittee preparing a Plan B or other alternatives.Mr Coveney said “the easy thing is just to call for an extension, but we do not get an extension unless the UK side wants to pursue that approach”.He said there is “no hidden solution that will pop up in a few weeks’ time” and they would have to try “to find a way of getting an agreement on these very difficult timelines”.What about a trade deal?Mr Coveney warned that “if it is not possible to conclude an agreement because of the tightness of these timelines we have to have plans in place to try to protect Irish interests as best we can”.He told Green Party finance spokeswoman Neasa Hourigan and Independent TD Marian Harkin that the Unite Kingdom is refusing to deal with the issue of a level playing field and common standards but wanted facilitation on a trade deal.“If we do not have serious negotiation and engagement from the UK side on level playing field issues” then “we are running into a roadblock”, he said.People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett said that if Ireland is going to make the case to the North for a united Ireland “we must at a minimum have an all-Ireland national health service which is properly resourced, with the necessary capacity, where we treat our health workers properly and well. People in the North will not be attracted to a united Ireland if it involves a two-tier under-resourced, under-capacity health service.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: John ThysThere’s one word no one wants to hear in Brussels: Brexit. Profound weariness has set in in the European Union capital towards Britain’s project, even as talks stall to try to find an agreement to avoid a damaging lurch to default trade terms at the end of the year.There’s a sense of deja vu to the rows and speculation in the British press. Lately, the talk has returned to the idea of a “Canada-style deal”, with gossip that British negotiators could demand a copy of the bespoke arrangement tailored to the specifics of the transatlantic trade relationship that took seven years to negotiate.“I’ve heard talk about a Canadian-style deal for a long time. In fact I think it generated a lot of internal debate in the British government around 2017,” trade commissioner Phil Hogan wearily told The  when asked about the idea. “It continues to be an issue.”Part of the jadedness is because the EU is busy dealing with the biggest economic shock in its history and the worst pandemic in a century. These are challenges nobody wanted. Brexit, on the other hand, was voluntary.Britain chose disruption, and much of the angst and delay associated with this is due to the fact that the government rushed into it without working out the details of what the point of it was in advance.London’s negotiators seem to have adjusted little to the post-Covid reality. Even as talks were delayed and moved to videoconference due to the pandemic, officials refused to countenance even the idea of extending the current transition period to allow more time for talks.Blast from past“It’s exceptional. Never in the history for such important negotiations with any third country, have we been under such time pressure,” an exasperated chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier said after the last round concluded without progress in the most contentious areas.Tuesday’s headline in the Financial Times – “Northern Ireland tensions threaten to derail Brexit long-term EU-UK deal” – was greeted as a blast from the past.This new rehearsal of the old theme relates to the EU’s request to set up an office in the North to work with local officials as they implement the complex new arrangements agreed in the withdrawal deal last year to avoid a hard border on the island.London recently started briefing that such an office would be isive, and dropping dark warnings about the Belfast Agreement, despite its diplomatic service having agreed to the idea last year.Until the talk of sovereignty from Westminster, it was a non-issue in the North itself. This is a carbon copy of events that led to the ditching of the so-called backstop, which only became a topic of contention after Conservative Party politicians began talking about it as “annexation”, giving unionists little choice but to oppose it.“I’m not aware that anyone in Northern Ireland of any persuasion was getting exercised about the EU office,” SDLP Assembly member Matthew O’Toole told The . “It was not a battleground in NI before the UK government started publicly suggesting it was unacceptable.”‘Territory question’It’s common for international organisations to have global offices, whether the United Nations or the OECD. The EU has over 129 – including, until Brexit became a reality at the end of January, one in Belfast. Even Northern Ireland itself has “Invest NI” offices in Brussels, Dusseldorf, Dubai, Manchester and Dubai. The North has long had bespoke diplomatic arrangements: it has its own office in the United States, the Northern Ireland Bureau in Washington DC, which works there to promote “political, economic, educational, and cultural” links.\u0026nbsp“It’s not a territory question, because not even embassies count as territory, even though they are sometimes wrongly portrayed that way in the movies,” said Joris Larik, an expert in EU external relations at Leiden University.“Imagine it was the other way around,” Larik mused. “Imagine the UK wanted a technical office in Rotterdam or Hamburg or in an important EU member state that they do a lot of trade with, to help out with all the paperwork that is coming their way. I don’t think that would make the headlines, I just can’t imagine anybody would be interested in that. It’s an uninteresting piece of news.”For the EU, this is another example of a technical issue becoming unnecessarily politicised by Britain, and it’s increasingly a problem when it comes to something that agreement hinges on: trust.“There are increasing worries on the EU side that the British government isn’t really 100 per cent serious about implementing this . . . and then if you can’t even have an office . . .” Larik trailed off. “The Achilles’ heel of the Northern Ireland protocol is that it relies on the UK to implement it.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Control answered that they had not and signed off the reply with a ‘QRX’ code, indicating the time they will speak on the next day.   Intercepted by the British, the Bletchley Park analyst commented on the signal: “He does not seem to have much opinion of the speed of our troops as he gives each outstation a QRX for tomorrow morning”. In fact the Tommies arrived at Cuxhaven at 14.00 on May 6, an hour and a half after Control said they’d not arrived yet.As the Allies closed in the radio network rapidly collapsed as stations went off the air.Realising he was probably alone and with his calls unanswered, the last German signaller still at his post, Lieutenant Kunkel, sent the final message of the war from the network wishing any listening colleagues good luck.Intercepted by Bletchley Park codebreakers, he signed off for the very last time at 07.35 on the morning of May 7, 1945, saying:“British troops entered Cuxhaven at 14.00 on 6 May – from now on all radio traffic will cease – wishing you all the best. Lt Kunkel” This was immediately followed by: “Closing down for ever – all the best – goodbye”A day later the war was over, but Bletchley Park codebreakers carried on working monitoring German communications to confirm that they were surrendering and that there would be no final stand by the Nazis.GCHQ\u0027s Historian Tony Comer said: “These transcripts give us a small insight into the real people behind the machinery of war. “While most of the UK was preparing to celebrate the war ending, and the last of the German military communicators surrendered, Bletchley staff – like today’s GCHQ workers – carried on working to help keep the country safe.”The document, graded Top Secret at the time due to the sensitivity around the work at Bletchley Park, was signed off in Hut 6 by Professor Frederick Norman, known as ‘Bimbo’ because of his child-like enthusiasm, quickness of wit and intellectual curiosity.Described by one of the women working at Bletchley Park as “quite a character” due to his habit of wearing a trilby hat and leggings, Professor Norman specialised in providing scientific intelligence to the Air Ministry’s Chief Scientist.According to Tony Comer, Frederick Norman learned German while a prisoner in the First World War and was recruited for Bletchley Park in September 1939 from his post as Professor of Medieval German at King’s College, London. In 1940 he became one of the original Watch staff in Hut 3, where Alan Turing occasionally worked, and had become Head of the Hut 3 Research Section by May 1942.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"eu agreed chinese censorship coronavirus origins","story":"The European Union agreed to Chinese censorship of a public letter by its ambassadors that removed any mention of the fact the coronavirus pandemic originated in China, it has emerged. The EU’s foreign affairs service agreed to cut out a reference to the “outbreak of the coronavirus in China” as a reason for a cancelled EU-China summit in the letter, which was published in the state-run China Daily newspaper. The European External Action Service (EEAS) excised the reference after coming under pressure from China’s foreign ministry. Two weeks ago, the EEAS was forced to deny it had bowed to Beijing by watering down language in a report accusing China of a campaign of disinformation about the virus. It was revealed EU officials softened some of the language condemning China after repeated calls by Chinese officials.“It is of course regrettable to see that the sentence about the spread of the virus has been edited,” said Nicolas Chapuis, the EU’s ambassador to China, who co-signed the opinion piece with the 27 ambassadors to China of the bloc’s member states. The senior diplomats wrote the letter to celebrate 45 years of diplomatic relations between Beijing and the EU. Diplomats in Brussels and politicians in Europe were dismayed at the latest decision but officials insisted that the letter would not have been published unless the cut was made. Norbert Rottgen, the head of the German parliament’s foreign affairs committee, said he was shocked “not once but twice”. “First the EU ambassadors generously adopt Chinese narratives and then on top of that the EU representation accepts Chinese censorship of the joint op-ed. Speaking with one voice is important but it has to reflect our shared European values and interests,” he said. “The EU delegation made known its concerns. The EU continues to advocate a free press. On this specific case the EU delegation decided to proceed with publication with considerable reluctance because it considered it important to communicate the key messages.”China is attempting to block EU moves in the World Health Organisation to push for an investigation into the pandemic over language that states it started in China. The US also supports the UN resolution on the probe into the origin and spread of coronavirus when the World Health Assembly convenes later this month. Beijing  accused the USA of trying to shift blame over the coronavirus on Thursday, after President Donald Trump said the pandemic was a worse attack than Pearl Harbor or 911.Tension between the world\u0027s two biggest economies has reached fever pitch in recent days as they have exchanged barbed comments on each other\u0027s handling of the virus.Mr Trump has claimed the virus leaked from a lab in Wuhan, while Chinese diplomats have floated the idea it was planted there by US military. The president said the coronavirus pandemic should never have happened on WednesdayCould have been stopped at the source. Could have been stopped in China, he said.We urge the US side to stop shifting the blame to China and turn to facts, said foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying at a press briefing.They might say the pandemic is comparable to Pearl Harbor or 911, but the enemy facing the US is the novel coronavirus, she said. China said for the first time Thursday that researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were trained in the US and France, as it faces repeated US claims that the coronavirus pandemic originated there.The lab\u0027s French ties have previously sparked concern in France. The Institut Merieux, Alain Merieux\u0027s firm, has strenuously denied taking part in the lab\u0027s design, construction and management.French President Emmanuel Macron has also denied that there was any evidence linking the Wuhan P4 lab to Covid-19.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"meet ve day life lockdown","story":"Earlier this year, in an increasingly distant pre-Covid age, plans were announced to celebrate the 75th anniversary of VE Day. There was to be a parade of veterans past Buckingham Palace organised by the Royal British Legion, packed pubs allowed to extend their opening hours long into the night, street parties under streams of fluttering bunting and Winston Churchill’s victorious speech declaring triumph in Europe broadcast in towns and cities across the country.But all that was before a new enemy entered our midst. Instead, this Friday, as with every day for the past six weeks of lockdown, those same streets which 75 years ago thronged with revellers will be deserted. Trafalgar Square and Whitehall, where the Queen and Princess Margaret sneaked out to celebrate with the joyous throng, will be left to the ghosts of a distant past as Britain once more finds itself on a war footing, with no clear end in sight. The events of May 8, 1945, provide a tantalising glimpse of the euphoria of a nation coming together in celebration against a vanquished enemy. We cannot know when and even how it will happen, but we already have a name for the eventual moment of triumph over the coronavirus: VC Day.“Silence” is how 94-year-old Bob Garner will be marking the anniversary of VE Day on Friday, self-isolating at home in Cambridge with his wife of 69 years, Miriam. What a contrast to 75 years ago when the then 19-year-old Private of the 1st Battalion, The Suffolk Regiment, was summoned by his Sergeant Major and instructed he had been selected for the victory parade. At the time Private Garner was convalescing at barracks in Bury St Edmunds having been shot in the throat during the push through Normandy the previous autumn. When he was picked up lying in the middle of the road, blood pumping from the wound and crying for his mother, it was initially presumed he was not going to make it. “We took a bashing,” Garner recalls. “Men were getting killed every minute of the day.”A Canadian doctor at a field hospital in Bayeux saved his life and he was flown home in a white Dakota with a red cross painted on the side. By VE Day he remained paralysed in the neck and required to take heavy medication. But he was told to collect his rifle, polish his boots, and board the next train for London. Garner recalls being collected by a convoy of Army trucks from King’s Cross station and taken to Regent’s Park where they camped under canvas for the night. On the morning of VE Day he was given a berth on an open top truck and joined the procession through central London. At one stage the men in his vehicle spotted the then 19-year-old Princess Elizabeth dressed in the uniform of the Auxiliary Transport Service.“We all cheered for her on the truck and she waved back,” he recalls. “That made our day.”He remembers heavy guns being towed through the crowds, music blasting out from every street corner, and revellers shouting and waving flags. “It felt like everything was finally going right for us,” he says. Eventually he returned to camp at around 11pm – still early, with people dancing though the night around Trafalgar Square. Not that Private Garner was able to join in the Lindy Hop and group huddles to the wartime favourite ‘Knees Up Mother Brown’. “There was no dancing for me,” he says. “I was only strong enough to walk a couple of steps.” Joan Hall, a 95-year-old former WRAF, was one of those in the crowds at Trafalgar Square until the early hours. “I had never seen so many happy people in my life,” she recalls. “All the pubs were full with people singing and on the streets everybody was dancing. I lost count with everyone I danced with. They all looked the same eventually. Everybody was kissing everybody else – today you wouldn’t dream of it.”London that day was the focal point of the celebrations. It was where the Royal family appeared on the balcony at Buckingham Palace to wave to the crowds and where the official peace declaration was announced by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who stood on a balcony outside the Ministry of Health and announced “this is your victory”.Just as his successor (and biographer) Boris Johnson has sought to emulate during the coronavirus pandemic, in his speech Churchill praised the optimism and fortitude of the British public. “Did anyone want to give in… Were we down-hearted”, he shouted to a crowd, which each time screamed back “NO”. He continued: “the lights went out and the bombs came down. But every man, woman and child in the country had no thought of quitting the struggle.”Churchill’s words – as with the later 9pm radio address by King George VI – were broadcast across the land. In villages and towns, trestle tables were erected and neighbours gathered what meagre supplies they could muster after five years of rationing to throw street parties.A then seven-year-old Beryl Story was at one such party on Barnard Street in Thornaby-on-Tees. A photograph from the day (which was later turned into a documentary Victory’s Children) shows her sitting fourth from left in her Sunday school dress, in a row of children holding up ‘V’ for victory signs with their fingers. Beryl – now 82 – recalls treats such as spam paste sandwiches, jelly topped with custard, fairy cakes and crunchy cornflake tarts. “I remember thinking what a lot of cake,’’ she says.But even for a seven-year-old that day the celebrations were bittersweet. Beryl’s younger brother, Barry, had died of meningitis during the war aged just two-and-a-half-years-old. Her grandmother and aunts and uncles who lived a few streets away had also been bombed out of their home during a Luftwaffe air raid and arrived one evening terrified and streaked with dust and rubble. “We were scared because our parents were but it was exciting as well,” Beryl says. “It must be similar for children today.”Only four people in that photograph are still alive, Beryl says, while Barnard Street itself is long gone – demolished to make way for a dual carriageway. She still lives in a bungalow in Thornaby-on-Tees. Her husband, Vic, died in 1978 and her two children live elsewhere. She has spent lockdown alone, keeping sane by playing piano and listening to classical music. Every Thursday at 8pm she has joined the neighbours in her street clapping for carers and NHS workers, and says the display of community solidarity has reminded her of those wartime years.“Neighbours have been helping people out,” she says. “I really hope this leads to a kinder society.”This weekly celebration in defiance of the virus offers hope of a time when we can come together once more, link arms on the street and dance with strangers, and not give a passing thought to the ‘R’ value which determines the speed at which coronavirus can tear through a population if left unchecked. Today VC Day lies at an indeterminate point in the future. Much like the end of the Second World War, it’s likely our victory over Covid-19 will arrive with several false dawns. Even as Britain celebrated in May 1945, the war in Japan, after all, did not end until August that year. As countries begin to lift lockdown, the virus will no doubt launch a counter offensive. Already, we\u0027ve seen evidence from several countries that the reproductive rate of the disease rises as soon as some social restrictions are eased.VC Day, in all likelihood, will arrive in different guises. There will be the cautious moment of optimism which occurred in South Korea last week when no new cases were confirmed in a single day. Then there will be wider celebrations of the like seen in November 2015, when Sierra Leone celebrated 42 days without a new ebola case – the criteria set by the World Health Organisation for declaring the outbreak officially over. But for a virus that thrives on human intimacy, VC Day will mostly be about the moment we can be close to one another again without fear of spreading infection. For Beryl Story it will be when she can finally hug her son, Craig, a retired policeman who lives in nearby Middlesbrough and has been dropping shopping off at her door during the lockdown.Until then everything remains different. Well, nearly everything. At 9pm on Friday, just as her father did in 1945, the Queen will lead the tributes to those who fought for our freedom and security. And then people will emerge to sing Vera Lynn’s famous wartime song together from their doorsteps.Not for 75 years will those three words have meant so much to a nation:We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed emailed offer help turkish t shirt salesman led ppe","story":"It began with an emailed offer of help from a T-shirt salesman in Turkey who promised that he could help solve the UK\u0027s worsening personal protective equipment (PPE) crisis.Little more than three weeks later, a Royal Air Force plane was pictured waiting on the tarmac at an airport in Istanbul as ministers were accused of presiding over a farce.And finally – as The  revealed on Wednesday – the saga ended in catastrophe. On arrival in the UK, thousands of hospital gowns were discovered to be useless and now lie in a warehouse near Heathrow. Around 170,000 more remain in Turkey after officials blocked their delivery over safety fears.Around 68,000 gowns provided directly by the Turkish government have passed safety tests, it is understood.On Thursday, senior MPs demanded an inquiry into how the mission – dubbed Air Jenrick – had gone so badly wrong.Downing Street said the UK Government would now seek a full refund or replacement, while hospital chiefs accused ministers of making critical deals on a wing and a prayer.NHS procurement chiefs, meanwhile, questioned why officials had pinned their hopes on a firm founded only four months ago with experience of making T-shirts and tracksuits rather than high-quality medical gear.The Istanbul-based company, Selegna Tekstil, first came to the attention of the UK Government in mid-March when Mehmet Duzen, a former parliamentary candidate turned textile salesman, saw an appeal for supplies and sent an email to the Department of Health.Mr Duzen had an affection for the UK, having lived in London in the mid-2000s. In his message, the businessman said he had a factory capable of churning out hundreds of thousands of hospital gowns, each made to stringent safety standards and fit for the NHS front line.For around two weeks, the Department of Health did not reply. But then, as supply chains in China dried up and hospitals began running out of vital protective gear, Mr Duzen received a grateful response.Back-and-forth discussions began over an order of 400,000 gowns, to be produced at the Selegna factory and flown back to the UK. NHS officials sent over complicated documents setting out UK standards in detail, including sleeve lengths and the type of non-woven material needed to repel virus-carrying fluid.At first glance, Selegna appears to have been an unlikely saviour. Documents show the company was only founded on January 31 to supply clothing including T-shirts and tracksuits. Its slogan was More Than Expected.As coronavirus began to spread around the world, Mr Duzen and his sister Naile, the firm\u0027s owner, decided to switch production to high-quality medical gear. One factory that previously made sweets was instructed to make masks instead.Mark Roscrow, the chairman of the Health Care Supply Association, which represents NHS procurement chiefs, said Selegna\u0027s lack of a track record should have raised the alarm.We should have done proper checks on the company, Mr Roscrow said. It should have raised obvious risks because the company didn\u0027t have much experience. Clearly we had some confidence in them, but that has apparently been a mistake. It\u0027s ended up with money being poured down the drain.On Thursday April 17, the deal was approved and the order placed. The next day, Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) officials paid a deposit, with the contract stating that the full balance would be paid on delivery.By that time, hospitals were at risk of running out of gowns completely. Only hours before, Public Health England (PHE) had sent out an unprecedented alert warning health workers to reuse their disposable gowns and, where possible, to wear aprons and laboratory coats instead.Ministers were under severe pressure to explain to the public where the next consignments of vital PPE were coming from, so the fateful decision was taken to tell the nation about the Turkey delivery at the Downing Street press conference led by Robert Jenrick, the Communities Secretary, on Saturday April 19.Today I can report that a very large consignment of PPE is due to arrive in the UK tomorrow from Turkey, which amounts to 84 tonnes of PPE and will include, for example, 400,000 gowns – so a very significant additional shipment, he said.According to one report, officials from the Department of Health warned Number 10 not to publicise the Turkey deal but were overruled.Behind the scenes, there was already a problem. A draconian weekend lockdown had just been enforced in Turkey. In Istanbul, Mr Duzen and his colleagues found their usual suppliers were unavailable, with factory workers forced to stay at home.Meanwhile, the firm had not yet formally secured an export license from the Turkish government, needed to sidestep a national export ban on PPE.If it was a normal order, I would have cancelled it because there was a misunderstanding and there was no time, Mr Duzen told the Financial Times last month. How could I supply the goods in one night? We didn\u0027t sleep. During frantic conference calls, UK officials tried to break down the obstacles in time to fulfil Mr Jenrick\u0027s promise.The following day, Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, admitted that the consignment was not yet ready, adding that he hoped it would arrive the next day.On Monday, as the Air Jenrick mission dominated news coverage, the decision was taken to send the Airbus A400-M plane to Turkey anyway in order to apply pressure.According to one senior Whitehall source, there was considerable disquiet among RAF chiefs as Government press officers sent out regular releases promising that the delivery would shortly arrive.The MOD was not part of this. The RAF was only there to help out, the source said. There were constant updates every time the plane moved an inch, and pictures in the newspapers. It looked ridiculous, frankly.The PPE order was still not ready, however. Eventually, the Turkish government stepped in to help UK ministers save face. It was arranged that a last-minute shipment of only 32,000 gowns made by Ushas, a state-backed firm, would be packed onto the plane, which finally left for RAF Brize Norton on the Monday afternoon. Exactly what happened next is unclear. According to sources, UK officials in Turkey did check the boxes of gowns supplied by Selegna to make sure they adhered to the agreed standards.After being given the go-ahead, RAF personnel dragged an initial consignment of around 67,000 gowns on to two more planes, which left for the UK later that week. But when they arrived, inspectors from the Health and Safety Executive discovered a major problem. Tests on around 2,400 of the gowns revealed that they would not, in fact, keep NHS workers safe from coronavirus.Around 4,500 more did pass the tests, but officials placed an immediate halt on further deliveries. The useless gowns were impounded in a facility near Heathrow, where they remain.Senior sources admitted on Thursday that a further 170,000 Selegna gowns were blocked by the UK after the alarm was raised, and are still in Turkey being checked by the Turkish Standards Institute.Hospital trusts which had been promised the vital gear were then informed that their deliveries had been cancelled.Asked on Thursday what had happened, Mr Duzen claimed he had not received any complaints from the NHS. The fabric we supplied was certified, he insisted. If there was a problem, they could do research and let us know.Sources at the Department of Health, however, said officials were in negotiations with Selegna to either supply safe PPE or hand back the deposit.There was a view that it was good enough PPE – it is only when it has got here that teams have looked at it again and taken a view that it is not up to the right standard and they\u0027ve decided not to use it,” said Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland Secretary, on Thursday.It is not known exactly how much the UK has already paid, but the total order is thought to be in the region of £300,000.Tobias Ellwood, the chairman of the defence select committee, called for an investigation if errors have been committed. He said: I want this Government to succeed – but you need to demonstrate your success, not promise it and fail to deliver.Niall Dickson, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents organisations across the healthcare sector, said: This illustrates the danger of making promises on a wing and a prayer. We have warned repeatedly that setting big targets which are then not met and saying all will be well, when at the sharp end of care it is manifestly not, undermines confidence among clinical staff on the front line.A spokesman for the Department of Health said on Thursday that ministers were grateful for the assistance of the Turkish government, adding: We have received part of an order of around 400,000 gowns from a private supplier in Turkey. While a small number of these gowns have failed tests in the UK, more have passed tests making them suitable for use in the NHS.We are working night and day to source PPE internationally and domestically, and more orders are lined up and expected from suppliers in the UK and overseas. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ve day 2020 celebrations pictures","story":"The Red Arrows fly over Hyde Park in London for the VE Day 75 celebrations.  Coronavirus latest news: Plan to review lockdown every two weeksPolitics latest news: Wales reopens garden centres in \u0026#39modest\u0026#39 lockdown reviewVE Day 2020: Britons celebrate 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe DayHow Oprah Winfrey’s inner circle has become a ring of steel for Harry and MeghanSocial distancing: What are the rules and how might they change?Revealed: Boris Johnson\u0026#39s roadmap to ease lockdown and reopen schools and shopsWhen will the UK lockdown end?

In the deeds of sale, seen by Le Temps, six million francs were due to be paid at the end of last year. It now equates to eight million francs with interest, it claimed.Four months on, Etude du Ritz, a law firm, has been instructed by the vendor to launch legal proceedings at the local prosecution office.There was no immediate comment from Etude de Ritz on Thursday.Le Temps quoted a spokesman for the Yorks as saying: There is a dispute between the two parties in this matter, adding that the contractual details were subject to a confidentiality agreement. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: This isn\u0027t something we would comment on.The legal proceedings will be another blow for the Duke of York, who has already stepped back from duties as a member of the Royal family following the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.In recent weeks, he has been seen in Instagram photographs with his ex-wife, with whom he is still on good terms, packing bags for the NHS in what had been seen as an effort to rebuild his reputation.In November, he announced he would step back from public duties for the foreseeable future after facing mounting public pressure following a disastrous interview with the BBC\u0027s Emily Maitlis over his friendship with convicted child sex offender Epstein.I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein, he said in a statement then. He continues to emphatically deny any wrongdoing.Earlier this year, The Daily  revealed that the Duke - who is no longer represented by Buckingham Palace press office - had been receiving PR advice from Mark Gallagher, a crisis management specialist nicknamed the backroom fixer.As the FBI and US prosecutors sought to interview him about his relationship with Epstein, the Duke also hired Clare Montgomery, Britain\u0027s most respected extradition lawyer.Andrew married Sarah in 1986, splitting amicably in 1992 after having two daughters and orcing four years later. They remained close, often living in the same house as they brought up their daughters, and have continued to share the ski chalet.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lights went american airmans view londons ve day celebrations","story":"The explosion of joy had not yet erupted. But there, in the heart of London, darkness was strangely absent on one city street. A stream of light illuminated almost an entire city block.Some happy soul had raised a blackout shade. And for the first time in nearly six years, it was done without fear of inviting an air raid warden’s citation or German bombs.That marvellous lighted scene, foretelling the end of Europe’s deadliest period, has stayed with me all these years. The date was May 7, 1945.I was 20 then, and a B-24 bomber radio gunner on a three-day pass from my airbase outside of Norwich, a five-hour train ride away. On an Underground train en route to Piccadilly Circus, I kind of got the picture after spotting a newspaper headline: “Unconditional Surrender Imminent” it screamed in thick, black letters.The lighted street seemed to confirm the headline. By 3 p.m. the next day, it was official.Standing on the War Ministry balcony above Whitehall at that hour, a beaming Winston Churchill flashed his familiar V-sign. This time, though, his “V” for victory was no symbolic promise. “This is your victory,” he told a huge crowd that had gathered.Cheers grew into one hell of a party. People poured into the streets, shouting, dancing, embracing. They mounted double-decker buses and utility poles, waved flags, started bonfires and danced the hokey-cokey around a statue of Queen Victoria. Sirens blared, car horns honked and church bells pealed.I found myself drawn to Buckingham Palace. A roar from the crowd and wild applause greeted the appearance of the Royal Family on the balcony. From where I stood, among a mass of humanity, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, their princess daughters Elizabeth and Margaret, and prime minister Churchill were a distant blur. The next day, newspaper pictures showed them responding to the crowd’s adulation with smiles and waves.That night, floodlights illuminated Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament for the first time since the Battle of Britain began in 1939. And Big Ben’s toll, signaling the official end of the war in Europe, was greeted by exploding fireworks and screaming sirens.Bus and train service in and out of London was halted, and thousands who had flocked to the city to witness and participate in these historic moments jammed hotels and parks. US military personnel passes were extended for two days because of a mass transit breakdown.Great – except for the fact that the Red Cross servicemen’s hotel – and all other hotels – had no vacancies, and my money had run out. I wasn’t alone and joined hundreds of others, spending a damp, chilly night trying to keep warm and sleep near one of the bonfires in St James’s Park.A thin, dark-haired girl I met also was left out in the cold, unable to return to her suburban home because trains weren’t running. Doreen Jordan was her name and she told me that her mother had come to London to celebrate the end of the First World War and had met and married a Yank. She couldn’t wait for the end of rationing, she said, especially for the day when nylon stockings would be available in England. Several months later, back in the States, I answered her prayers and mailed her three pairs of nylon stockings. The anticipated thank-you note never arrived, though.My memories of those tumultuous days will be rekindled today. I’ll be there in spirit, recalling the joy and that chilly night in St James’s Park. This time, though, I’ll be with my wife of nearly 71 lucky years, and the sole survivor of my fun-loving, nine-member 8th Air Force B-24 bomber crew Today, I’ll drink a toast to the memory of my old buddies.

The coronavirus outbreak means that there will be no street parties, parades or concerts this year, but there is plenty going on to celebrate.A national two minute silence took place at 11am, which gave Britons the opportunity to pause and reflect, remembering the lives lost and sacrifices made in wartime. The RAF\u0027s Red Arrows also roared over parts of the UK, in a special flypast to mark the anniversary.The Queen will address the nation from Windsor Castle at 9pm. Her speech on the significance of VE Day will take place at the same time that her father, King George VI, gave a radio address back in 1945. After the Queen\u0027s Speech, a singalong will take place of Vera Lynn\u0027s We\u0027ll Meet Again, which has once again become a symbol of hope for Britons during the coronavirus pandemic.Follow all the latest below.The UK\u0027s first skytyping display has been conducted, to mark VE Day and pay tribute to frontline workers.Messages such as We Will Meet Again and Thank You were etched in the sky above Henstridge airfield in Somerset.The display was commissioned by the Department for Transport, which recently introduced a law change to allow skytyping and skywriting to take place.Skywriting was inadvertently discovered by an RAF pilot during the First World War, when oil accidentally entered a plane\u0027s exhaust, creating dense, white smoke.Victory in Europe Day will always be a landmark in British history and it is an honour to have commissioned the first skytyping display in the UK to mark the occasion.With its strong British history, stemming from the creation of skywriting, it seems an entirely fitting way to honour all those who fought for our freedom while also thanking those keeping the country moving during this challenging time.A copy of the Daily  from Tuesday May 08, 1945A copy of the Daily  from Friday May 04, 1945A copy of the Daily  from Saturday May 05, 1945 To find out more about how we covered the end of the war, read here. The Prime Minister has spoken with a 102-year-old Second World War veteran and told him he was awesome, following the two-minute silence held at 11am to mark VE Day.He held a Zoom call with a veteran, an amazing guy by the name of Ernie Horsfall.He is 102 and one of the UK\u0027s oldest surviving servicemen.Ernie served with the Army\u0027s Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers from 1940 to 1946 as a staff sergeant.He was in Naples on VE Day, on the outskirt of the city along the Pompeii road, running workshops to repair and maintain tanks.He and the PM had a really lovely conversation, they spoke for just over half an hour.Mr Johnson told Ernie he was awesome and a credit to his generation during the call.From the Queen to Dame Vera Lynn, the coronavirus crisis has been full of wartime references - but do the comparisons really pass muster?Our feature writer, Luke Mintz, has asked those who lived through both.The threat was external - people were afraid of bombs and invasion, and there was a psychological need to draw together with family and crowds, in pubs and so on, as a kind of reassurance, says Katherine Knight, 87. This time, the idea is that we should keep apart as much as we can.”You can read the full set of interviews here. The SSAFA, the armed forces charity, says it is immensely honoured to have received a message of support from the Queen on VE Day.The Queen, who is the charity\u0027s patron, was joined by Prince Michael of Kent in sending her best wishes.She said: As patron of SSAFA, the armed forces charity, I am pleased to send my best wishes to the beneficiaries, volunteers, employees and all those concerned with the charity on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of VE Day.At this increasingly challenging time, I know that you have continued to provide support to members of the armed forces and veterans, together with their families.As you reflect on the charity\u0027s 135-year history, my thoughts and prayers remain with you all for your continued safety and the future success of your important work.SSAFA has been providing lifelong support to the nation\u0027s forces and their families since 1885.Last year their teams of volunteers and employees helped more than 85,000 people in need, from Second World War veterans to young men and women who have served in more recent conflicts, and their families.Our feature writer, Joe Shute, has conducted a series of interviews with those who remember VE Day firsthand, from war heroes to young evacuees. You can read their moving accounts below:WW2 hero Harry Billinge: ‘Like the war, this experience will bring us together\u0027. The 94-year-old veteran speaks to Joe Shute about his VE day memories, and his hopes for a post-lockdown world‘VE Day was a normal day. There were some dark moments knowing the war had finished but not for us’. Flight lieutenant Doug Temple, 94, was stationed in East India when VE Day happened, and he was still at war ‘I lost count of the people I danced with in Trafalgar Square’. Former WRAF Joan Hall, 95, was given the day off to celebrate VE Day and joined the throngs of people heading to London‘VE Day meant I would be reunited with my family - we were strangers after so long apart’. Harry Norton, 90, was a 14-year-old wartime evacuee - VE Day meant he could finally see his family again‘On VE Day I met a young Wren. We promised to meet up but we never saw each other again’. Able seaman Seymour Taylor, 95, recounts coming ashore the day that celebrations ensuedA Royal British Legion chairman and his neighbours celebrated VE Day despite the coronavirus outbreak, and vowed to make the best of a sad situation with a socially distanced street party.Former soldier Eric Howden BEM, 75, had planned a parade with comrades in Redcar, Cleveland, but restrictions meant the event was cancelled.Instead, he organised a mark of remembrance outside his bungalow, lowering his branch\u0027s Royal British Legion standard at 11am and observing a minute\u0027s silence.Afterwards, as We\u0027ll Meet Again played over the loudspeakers from Mr Howden\u0027s garden, neighbours danced along and joined in.He said: The only alternative to what we had planned was to do it outside my own home and the neighbours have come forward too, some sitting in their gardens, some hanging over their fence.We have done our duty by paying respects and now we are going to have a street party, doing what we can under the circumstances.We are going to have a good time, with cakes, biscuits and buns that people have made, while observing the two-metre rule. We will enjoy it and make the best of a sad situation.In his message to Boris Johnson, Putin said: “The Great Victory was a pivotal event of the 20th century with enduring significance for the fate of all humankind. It was achieved thanks to the joint efforts of the Soviet Union and the countries of the anti-Hitler coalition. That invaluable experience is no less needed today.”The Kremlin said he also expressed confidence that the memory of the two nations’ “brotherhood-in-arms” would lead to a “constructive” Russian-British dialogue and co-operation.A billboard in Piccadilly Circus to thank Second World War veterans Piper Louise Marshall plays at dawn along Edinburgh\u0026#39s Portobello Beach, overlooking the Firth of Forth, on the 75th anniversary of VE DayThe statue of soldier \u0026#39Tommy\u0026#39, a war statue by artist Ray Lonsdale, is seen during sunrise in SeahamThe Todes Family Quartet observing the 2 minutes silence at 11am to mark VE Day, before performing a streaming concert at 12 noonPrior to leading today’s commemorations at Balmoral alongside the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall spoke with veterans of the 7th Armoured Division, also known as the Desert Rats who served in North Africa during the Second World War, Joe Shute reports. One of those was Sergeant Major Len Burritt, 101, who served alongside the Duchess’s father, Major Shand, in the Second World War,Speaking to the , Burritt, who joined the Army aged 18 and fought in more than 100 battles across 15 countries, recalls Major Shand as a prodigious worker which led to the nickname Major Gopher. “Everything that had to be done he had to do it,” he says.Speaking of her conversations with Len Burritt and another 107-year-old Desert Rat, Jimmy Sinclair, the Duchess said: “They both fought with outstanding courage in the \u0027Desert\u0027 war, in the same battles as my father did and I salute them both. These two distinguished veterans remind us of the heroic struggles they, and their fellow Desert Rats took part in all those years ago to hasten the end of the Second World War.”Len Burritt was in Germany in VE Day, although says he does not remember anything special about the day while Britain erupted in jubilation back home.

But later on, researchers realised that it did have some teeth further back in its jaws.”As well as big flippers, Cartorhynchus had flexible wrists for movement on the ground.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Aarts, an activist, philanthropist and chef, said: “We have ramped up from 200 to 3,900 meals a day but the move to Wembley will allow us to gear up further to cook and deliver 20,000 meals a day – which is 140,000 meals a week.How to support our campaign“We already supply 15 hospitals, elderly care homes, community centres and homeless hostels. These organisations are trying to cope with unprecedented demand for food and they keep asking us for more. Our new kitchen will allow us to keep pace with rising hunger and need.”Compassion London operates seven days a week with 25 chefs and 200 volunteers who pack and deliver food to charities and families. The fresh, raw produce comes daily from The Felix Project, the biggest distributor of surplus food in London, which has quadrupled its deliveries since lockdown to 40 tonnes a day and supplies daily more than 100 charities, schools and community hubs like Compassion London.The Independent has pledged to raise £10m to help The Felix Project feed hungry people across the capital over the next three years – with £3.65m already donated since we launched our appeal on 27 March.The Wembley facility is being given to Compassion London free of charge, thanks to Wembley Stadium, its in-house caterer Delaware North and the stadium’s owner, the Football Association.Top restaurant chefs join forces to provide free meals for familiesPhoebe Waller-Bridge backs our appealOur appeal raises £3.5m as food crisis deepensHead chef Mr Lomas said: “Using an empty kitchen and bringing food together to feed vulnerable people and the NHS is fantastic.

I think she might do well to take a leaf out of the shadow secretary\u0027s book in terms of tone.“I’m afraid what she said is not true. There’s been a rapid acceleration of testing offer the last few months in this country, including getting to 100,000 tests a day.“We’ve been entirely transparent on the way that that has been measured throughout, and I have confidence that the rate will continue to rise.“Currently capacity is 108,000 a day, and we are working to build that higher.“Of course, we’ve been working very hard to make the testing capacity grow as fast as possible and as more tests are available so we are able to make them available\u0026nbsp to more people and test people right across the NHS.”The prime minister\u0027s official spokesman later said: It may be at the moment there is less demand for tests from key workers because the infection rate is stablising or falling. I would hope everyone can agree that that is a good thing. If fewer people are going into hospital with coronavirus symptoms that will mean fewer tests need to be carried out in NHS setting. Likewise, if there\u0027s less community transmission, it will mean that key workers potentially need fewer tests. That shouldn\u0027t be seen as a bad thing.The key point is capacity has been really significantly increased. We can now do more than 100,000 tests a day and as we move forward into the next phase, including the rollout of \u0027trace, track and test\u0027, we have the capacity we need.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They also had a more positive perception of their cognitive abilities, i.e. memory, learning and ability to concentrate.”The basic income also appears to have moderate effect on encouraging people to find jobs – an effect some had theorised would occur because recipients do not lose their support when they take one up.The study found that people paid the income were in employment on average six days more than people in a control group where people were not payed the income.“The employment rate for basic income recipients improved slightly more during this period than for the control group,” the study said.The latter finding is in contrast to arguments by opponents of the policy, such as former DWP secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who suggested the policy would be a “disincentive” to work because it did not include sanctions.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Respondents were from the 27 EU member states and the UK.“For an idea that has often been dismissed as wildly unrealistic and utopian, this is a remarkable figure,” said authors Timothy Garton Ash and Antonia Zimmermann in an article on the findings.

New leader Keir Starmer has however moved away from backing the policy. It has long been supported by the Green party.Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, rejected the policy last month, telling MPs: “I think we need to have a very focused approach providing the resources that we need to those that need it most.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The stay at home regulations much remain in place until the next review in three weeks time. We must not lose the progress that we\u0027ve made.But he said there were some small and modest adjustment which we could make to the regulations, stating that the Welsh government wanted to make these adjustments on Monday so that we move in step with the other nations of the United Kingdom, as part of our determined preference for a four-nation approach.Boris Johnson accused of ‘mixed messages’ over lockdown easing – liveWe will adjust our regulations to allow people to go out and exercise more than once a day but we will strengthen our regulations to make it clear that that exercise must be local. It should begin and end at home and it should not involved any significant travel away from home.Our second planned change to the regulations will be to allow garden centres to reopen, provided that the two metres social distancing can be applied. And thirdly we propose changing the regulations to allow local authorities to begin planning how safely to reopen libraries and municipal recycling centres.He said the changes would apply to everyone other than the group of people being told to shield from the virus in their home homes and not go outside at all.Other supposedly expected\u0026nbspchanges, such as the supposed reopening of schools, ending of the two-metre social distancing rule and the reopening of other businesses or workplaces did not materialise in the announcement.Created with Sketch.High noon in a coronavirus-stricken world Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man holds a pocket watch at noon, at an almost empty market near the Imam Ali shrineWat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram (The Temple of the Emerald Buddha, part of The Grand Palace)An empty street leading to the historic Old Town SquareLawn stretching towards the Capitol, home of CongressA watch showing the time in front of Damascus GateThe Houses of Parliament seen from Westminster BridgeEmpty lanes in the city that saw the first outbreak of diseaseThe Malecon road and esplanade winds along the city\u0027s seafrontA little busier than elsewhere: midday traffic in Tahrir SquareThe Brandenburg Gate, the only surviving city gate in the capitalBolivar Avenue, opened in 1949 and the site of many demonstrations and ralliesSpasskaya Tower (left) on the eastern wall of the Kremlin, and St Basil\u0027s CathedralThe harbourside Eminonu district is usually buzzing with activityRajpath, a ceremonial boulevard that runs through the capitalThe Roman amphitheatre that dates back to the 2nd century ADThe main concourse of Grand Central station in ManhattanMaidan Nezalezhnosti, the site of many political protests since the end of the Soviet eraThe odd walker out in the midday sun on Ring Road CentralA man holds a pocket watch at noon, at an almost empty market near the Imam Ali shrineWat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram (The Temple of the Emerald Buddha, part of The Grand Palace)An empty street leading to the historic Old Town SquareLawn stretching towards the Capitol, home of CongressA watch showing the time in front of Damascus GateThe Houses of Parliament seen from Westminster BridgeEmpty lanes in the city that saw the first outbreak of diseaseThe Malecon road and esplanade winds along the city\u0027s seafrontA little busier than elsewhere: midday traffic in Tahrir SquareThe Brandenburg Gate, the only surviving city gate in the capitalBolivar Avenue, opened in 1949 and the site of many demonstrations and ralliesSpasskaya Tower (left) on the eastern wall of the Kremlin, and St Basil\u0027s CathedralThe harbourside Eminonu district is usually buzzing with activityRajpath, a ceremonial boulevard that runs through the capitalThe Roman amphitheatre that dates back to the 2nd century ADThe main concourse of Grand Central station in ManhattanMaidan Nezalezhnosti, the site of many political protests since the end of the Soviet eraThe odd walker out in the midday sun on Ring Road CentralAsked about the plans outlined by the Welsh first minister, including the re-opening of garden centres and libraries, and whether the public should expect to see it in England too, the prime minister’s official spokesperson said: “I haven’t seen details of what’s been announced.”When the spokesperson was told what had been announced, they\u0026nbspadded only that any moves the PM would outline in his address to the nation on Sunday “will be very limited” and the government will be taking a “very cautious approach” in order to avoid a further peak in the virus.On the devolved administrations possibly announcing different plans from the UK Government, the spokesman added: The PM has set out on the call (to devolved administration leaders on Thursday) we understand there could be circumstances where there is ergence and when there is evidence that supports it.

I heard — I thought you liked me.”Ms\u0026nbspReade\u0026nbspclaimed that he then got angry with her and said “You are nothing to me. You are nothing,” but eventually held her by the shoulders and told her: “You’re OK. You’re fine.”​Joe Biden to publicly address Tara Reade sexual assault claimsIn a written statement published before his Morning Joe interview, Mr Biden said: “Responsible news organisations should examine and evaluate the full and growing record of inconsistencies in her story, which has changed repeatedly in both small and big ways.”Mr Biden’s deputy campaign manager Kate\u0026nbspBedingfield\u0026nbsptold CNN about the incident: “Vice President\u0026nbspBiden\u0026nbsphas dedicated his public life to changing the culture and the laws around violence against women.“He authored and fought for the passage and reauthorization of the landmark Violence Against Women Act. He firmly believes that women have a right to be heard – and heard respectfully,” she said.“Such claims should also be diligently reviewed by an independent press. What is clear about this claim: it is untrue. This absolutely did not happen.”The Independent has contacted Mr Biden’s team for comment.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

All major counselling and psychotherapy bodies in the UK, as well as the NHS, have condemned the discredited\u0026nbsppractice,\u0026nbspaccording to\u0026nbspLGBT+ charity Stonewall.Germany’s health minister Jens Spahn, who is\u0026nbspgay, said: “Young people are being forced into conversation therapies and so it is very important that they should find support in the existence of this law: a clear signal that the state does not want this to happen.Councilwoman calls openly gay mayor a ‘paedophile’ and a ‘woman’ Gay and bisexual coronavirus patients barred from plasma trialsWhat the murder of Michael Boothe tells us 30 years onGay men in Morocco falling victims to outing campaignAndy Cohen speaks out against ‘discriminatory’ blood donations rules“Homosexuality is not an illness. Therefore the term ‘therapy’ is already misleading.However, the opposition Green Party – who were the first to call for the ban in 2013 – said the new law did not go far enough and the age limit should be raised to 26. The Left Party, the fifth largest in the Bundestag,\u0026nbspwants to raise it to 27.Green legislators wrote: “Only minors are to be protected from this life-endangering charlatantry. At the very least, young people aged between 18 and 26 need comparable protection, as is shown by the experiences of coming out and many young people’s dependence on their families.Mr\u0026nbspSpahn\u0026nbspdid not specify reasons for the age limit, but German law makes it easier to protect minors, whereas freedom of speech and conscience laws are seen as more problematic to implement for over-18s.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A policeman uses his baton to push a resident breaking rules, during an extended nationwide lockdown to slow down the spread of coronavirus in Ahmedabad, IndiaA nurse tends to a crying newborn baby wearing a face shield at the National Maternity Hospital in HanoiBride Janine runs over to her wedding at a Drive-in cinema in Duesseldorf, Germany.

The remaining bank holidays are:A bank holiday is a public holiday in the UK when most people are given an extra day off work.They were given the name bank holidays as banks are closed - andthey cant do business, no-one  can.Similarly, schools are shut on bank holidays, and transport services are often scaled back.Booking certain days off work can help your holiday allowance stretch further.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

British journalism, in particular.What’s stopping you right now from falling off your perch in fits of laughter  Well, the fact that you’re currently digesting a work of journalism.This probably means that it’s an act – let’s call it that for now – which you’re used to committing on a fairly regular basis.Let’s also assume then that much of the information you gather, store and share comes from such journalistic sources.It’s likely you frequently form opinions and make decisions based on this content you consume.In fact, think really hard for a moment and try and imagine an area of your le where you haven’t been guided in some form by journalism.Buying a house, investing your savings, choosing a school, picking a holiday, deciding which box to put your cross in when you go into a polling booth .If you’re honest with yourself, you tend to make most of those decisions after you’ve digested the array of journalism available to you. And let’s also admit, disregarded too.Some of it is opinion led, some is impartial. You might not agree with all of it, and sometimes you might get ruddy cross at a paper or commentator that doesn’t chime with your world view.But together, the many erse components of British journalism create something which is profoundly valuable.The Covid- pandemic has tested our society to the limit. In the midst of a national crisis, journalists have been putting their lives at risk to keep you informed.News outlets have faithfully broadcast public health announcements – but also held our political leaders to account.The Downing Street daily conference has become a household staple, with ministerial interrogation by the press corps regularly influencing government policy.Without such probing questions and front page splashes, would you have known about the dearth of PPE or the crisis in our care homes Journalism, from local to national level, has connected communities in a way that social networks can only dream of. We have celebrated triumph in the face of adversity – and also documented tributes from the tens of thousands who have lost loved ones.But now we come to the rub.With the country under lockdown, British journalism is facing the biggest threat in its storied history.For newspapers, sales have dramatically fallen. For broadcasters and online outlets, advertising has gone through the floor even whilst audience numbers have risen.Yes, journalism joins one of many industries in financial peril right now.The work of reporters should be held up to scrutiny like any other profession. But we also need to acknowledge the sacrices its practitioners are making to keep the public informed.Everything that journalism hands to you doesn’t come for free.I’m sure that when you think about this properly, in a way you might never have done before, it really is needed more than everWe have to safeguard journalism. It is far too important to discard because it isn’t worth contemplating what the world would look likequality journalism didn’t exist.I don’t need to urge you to buy a paper or take up an online subscription, but I want you to tell everyone you meet that our sector is under a very real and present threat.I am the CEO of the Journalists’ Charity. It was founded in  by Charles Dickens and a group of parliamentary reporters – naturally in a pub.Our core mission to this day remains the same: to bring aid to journalists and their dependents who have fallen on hard times.We are stepping up to the mark, helping those in need with emergency funding and practical and emotional support.It’s why we’ve launched a #supportjournalism campaign in print and on social media.For me, a lockdown without journalists would be unthinkable.That’s why the Journalists’ Charity is standing four-square behind our industry when it needs us most. But we also need you to do your bit too.The Journalists’ Charity has been helping journalists through tough times for more than  years. The charity is currently supporting iniduals from all sectors struggling from the impact of Coronavirus.

If Boris Johnson is to get our flatlining economy going again, he and his Government must prove to the public that lockdown restrictions can be lted sensibly and safely.And that’s where homemade masks come in. Yes, we know they’re not perfect. But mounting evidence proves that insisting on their use in confined spaces can help slow the spread of the virus, and — crucially — they lend confidence.One way or another, it’s becoming crystal clear that after lockdown Britain will be very dferent from the country we remember. Gone are the days of a post-work pint in the pub to wind down:ministers permit us to socialise, it will be only for picnics, and only with those we consider our close friends.But with the economy on its knees, we must throw everything we’ve got at creating a “new normal” to tide us over until a vaccine can be found.Andmasks are part of that, then let’s get Britain sewing.OFFICIALS must stop hiding behind corona-jargon and start explaining in plain English exactly what they want from us.Guidance states thatyou’re classed as “extremely clinically vulnerable” you’re supposed to “shield”, andyou’re considered “clinically vulnerable” you should be “closely following social distancing rules”.The problem is thatyou’re over  and not in the habit of scrutinising government websites, you may understandably not know what the dference between those terms is. And so could be putting yourself through the misery of a  week self-isolation unnecessarily.Brits have given up most of their cherished liberties at the drop of a hat.

I am , so when I joined the workforce we were in the midst of a financial crisis that plunged the economy into paralysis.I have endured years of political to-ing and fro-ing over spending, infrastructure projects and — whether you voted for it or not — Westminster’s tortuous Brexit chicanery that has slowed down economic growth.The price  Real wages, measured alongside inflation, only got back above their  levels this year.House prices shot up to unaffordable levels, with governments promising to build the houses we need but failing miserably to take on the vested interests that stand in the way.Young people could already only dream of owning a home before the world shut down.Just this week, a friend sent round a story on WhatsApp about the possibility of house prices collapsing.We all just laughed and agreed we still could not get anywhere near a deposit, and not because we have been enjoying too much avocado toast.And just as we looked forward to a British bounce once Brexit was in the rear-view mirror, now a global pandemic has made  look like nothing more than a trailer for the main event in which this young generation, yet again, gets a starring role.It is not just about getting money moving and business booming, either.The temporary schemes introduced by the Government to get people through the worst of this crisis will leave a borrowing pile that not even Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell could have dreamed up.Most likely, that means higher taxes and lower spending for decades. In short, Britain’s under-s are being condemned to years of an economy going backwards.So it is time for them to be allowed back to work and start the recovery. We should all be invested in British companies’ success.The better they do, the more jobs they create, the more they can pay, the better le is. Yes, there is a risk to getting the young back to work.But witness the orderly queues outside supermarkets and the pavement shuffle dance that we have all perfected to give each other space.The public, young and old, understand the threat of this virus.We invented all these video apps everyone is now socialising on. We are more than happy to use them for a little while longer.As for employers, they have built everything from thriving construction businesses to high-tech apps.It is not going to be beyond them to install plastic screens in the office, and nor are Lisa in marketing and Phil in accounts going to make like Professor Pantsdown in the filing cupboard.Are we prepared to trust our fellow Brits, take that risk and allow the next generation a better chance to succeed Even some of those in the highest at-risk groups will acknowledge we cannot live in economic shutdown forever.Even the boffins at Oxford know a vaccine will take months,not years.AndTikTok-ing millennials are not exactly winning much sympathy, what about the parents of young kids Anybody looking after children at home right now knows full well their productivity is close to zero.They need schools and nurseries open, too.Britain’s most dynamic cities and companies are being driven by the young, from the video game industry in Dundee to the start-up hubs of Shoreditch.They have had a decade of flatlining wages, a housing crisis and now the corona crash. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Those who could not serve overseas volunteered on farms to help feed our nations.And in unprecedented numbers, women stepped up to serve in field hospitals, factories, fire departments, and civil defence stations.Commitment, innovation, and self-sacrice are what made that first VE Day possible.And that is exactly what we are seeing again today.Medical workers, supermarket workers, and bus drivers are stepping up in service to others to defend against Covid-.People are observing social distancing in order to keep others safe.Neighbours are taking care of neighbours. We are also seeing the same tremendous innovation we saw during WWII.Scientists are racing against the clock to develop therapies and vaccines. Hospitals are being built in record time.Schools are finding new ways to continue to educate our young people remotely.We are even seeing the modernof the Victory Gardens, as families across our countries plant fresh fruit and vegetables in gardens and window boxes.And, someday soon we will all meet again, and raise a glass to the heroes of today, and the heroes of WWII.That greatest of generations will remain our guiding inspiration – not only on account of their heroism and sacrice during the war, but also their resilience and resolve after it.When countries across the world lay in ruins after the war, with industries and economies on their knees, they rolled up their sleeves and they got to work to rebuild and re-emerge stronger than before.That is exactly what we will do as soon as the lockdown is over.Just this week, our governments kicked off the formal process to start negotiating a huge US-UK trade deal.Trade is at the heart of our shared prosperity on which our shared security is built.Working side by side, as we always do, there is no limit to the opportunities and prosperity our countries will create.So on a day when we celebrate the heroes and victories of the past, we are also looking forward to the future and laying the groundwork for a new era of success in the Special Relationship.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Everyone knows that construction was not complete.Kims reemergence appears not to be business as usual as North Korea suggests, but a carefully crafted publicity stunt for the dictator.South Korea has insisted all is well with Kim, but questions and theories loom over his health - such as a mysterious needle mark on his arm and credible reports China sent a medical team to advise on him.Flurries of reports emerged from the US, Japan, South Korea and China - all of them saying the same thing, something is wrong with Kim.Kim healths is not believed to be good, reportedly being a prolic binge eater, heavy drinker and chain smoker with a history of heart problems in his family.He has also reportedly only made  public appearances this year, as opposed to  in .Wilder theories have speculated the Kim who appeared on May  is actually just a body double standing in for him.Meanwhile, North Korea is believed to be constructing a new missile base able to house  of his nuclear-capable Hwasong- weapons.And Kim went missing again this week when he didnt appear at a ceremony in which Russia awarded him a medal in Pyongyang as part of anniversary celebrations for the defeat of Nazi Germany.Mintaro Oba, a former US official who worked on North Korea, told ABC: The blunt truth is that we can speculate all we want about where Kim Jong-un was and why he disappeared, but we simply dont know.It could be for health reasons, it could be for tactical reasons, we just dont know with any certainty and probably wont.Professor John Blaxland, from the Australian National University, added: We cant even be sure when these were taken, there is the question ofits even him as he has a body double but I dont give much credence to that theory.Theres certainly the question of whether or not this is even a real event.The academic said Kims unexplained lack of appearance on The Day of The Sun is the big question, while Mr Oba said experts are looking very closely at the pictures.Professor Blaxland suggested his disappearance may have been a carefully arranged piece of political theatre, designed to flush out any dissenters among his inner circle.And with South Korea claiming Kim was hiding from the coronavirus, that raises more questions as North Korea continues to boast it has zero cases of the infection.Meanwhile, days after he reappeared North and South Korea exchanged fire over the heavily fortied DMZ that separates the two nations - driving home the fact the region remains on a kne edge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But a fellow young soldier was running to catch up, so they pulled him in and he sat opposite my grandpa, who askedhe was OK.He replied “yes”, only for his stomach and guts to fall out all over the floor. He was dead within minutes.Because my grandpa was a professional soldier, he wasn’t demobilised and sent home after the war, but was billeted with the family of a German soldier of equal rank as he became part of the occupation forces in the British-run sector of what would become West Germany.Just imagine how hard that must have been: Living with someone who a few weeks earlier you were trying to kill.But my grandpa said: “They were just like us, fighting for their country.”Without wanting to disparage the generations that have followed — mine included — it’s hard to imagine a member of Generation X or a millennial turning such trauma into a positive way of living.But,  years on, there’s very good reason why our leaders today have regularly invoked the unsurpassed generation who came of age during World War Two throughout the current coronavirus crisis.It’s no coincidence this group of fine folk includes the Queen, Sir David Attenborough and Captain Tom Moore, who have all provided the nation with so much inspiration at a time when celebrities, experts and politicians have often looked so deeply inadequate.That gives me some hope that out of our current trauma will come a new great generation of young leaders to shepherd us through the next  years.Maybe I’m naive, but I think the current pain and uncertainty surrounding lockdown could strengthen the character of young people, who have been mollycoddled by teachers and parents for so long.This is the only time since the last world war where the entire globe is engaged in a conflict that has upended le as we know it.We are again surrounded by tragedy, uncertainty and genuine fear.Adults can no longer provide easy assurances or answers to children about when they will be able toto normal le, be it visiting grandparents, going on holiday, shopping for clothes or attending school.While this is a situation no one would ever have wished for, I have a growing optimism that we are never going to take any of those seemingly everyday pursuits for granted again.What’s so striking about the generation who lived through World War Two is their total rejection of unnecessary consumerism. The Queen is a great example of this.She has all the money and privilege in the world, but feels no need to replace her rotary-dial telephone from  at Windsor Castle or wallpaper that dates back to Queen Victoria at Balmoral.I guess anyone who worried about surviving the London Blitz or lived in terror over whether relatives and friends wouldfrom the front line understands that hyper- consumerism is largely unimportant.Grandpa Bill’s future we, Catherine Taylor, my beloved grandma, was  years old and living in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, when World War Two broke out.My great-grandfather, a World War One veteran and coal miner, had resolved to send her to Canada on the SS Athenia.Thank God he changed his mind at the last minute it was the first British ship lost after war was declared.She was instead evacuated to Cockermouth in the Lake District to live with another family, but ed home just as German bombers started targeting the Tyneside shipyards and suburbs of Newcastle.My proud Geordie grandma Rua, as I called her, spent night after night in a not-at-all-sturdy brick shelter in their back garden, listening to the bombs drop nearby, on one occasion on her actual street.It was no le for a teenager. She carried her gas mask everywhere, knitted for airmen, joined bucket lines to put out fires and grieved for the  people of Newcastle lost in the bombings.Then there was the daily fear of the “telegram boy” arriving with messages of relatives killed in combat.But determined to help the war effort further, she dropped out of school and in  joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service — the women’s branch of the British Army during the war.This week I listened back to an oral history I recorded with my late grandma in the Nineties where she recounted her experiences of the time in her typically stoic and understated manner.I noticed that any time I tried to guide her towards talking about the emotional cost of her teenage years being overtaken by tragedy, she batted it away.“We didn’t talk much about nasty things,” she said softly. “I hated the bombing and I was terried. Looking back, I think we got through it with lots of prayers.“The war taught you about tragedy in people’s lives but you just battled on regardless.”In fact, grandma said the positives included being “united as a nation” and “people caring for one another”.Was she ever depressed “Le was entirely dferent then. We did sort of lose our teenage years in a way because they weren’t happy go lucky.“Teenagers in England now have the chance to go on the Continent and travel around at a very small cost.We couldn’t do anything like that. You just carried on. You had to.”There is very little comparison to what we are going through at the moment with the six years of death and destruction in World War Two.But it’s impossible to deny that the travel, socialising and happy-go- lucky approach to le we had become accustomed to has been stolen from us, for now at least.Youngsters previously so obsessed with how many people watched their latest dance video on TikTok are starting to think twice about what really matters.They’re volunteering.

The scheme was designed to find work for jobless Brits.Mr Darling told Radio : The one thing we should learn about this is that the Government is not only the lender of last resort, it is also the insurer of last resort, it has got a duty to ensure that as far as we possibly can, people who lose their jobs are helped to get back into dferent employmentthat is necessary.He added: But for those people who are not going to be able to get back to work or will see signicant income reductions then only at the end of the day the Government can step in - that is what it is for.Airport and ground handling companies have called for a tapered end to the Governments job retention schemein a bid to avoid job losses.Organisations including Airlines UK, the Airport Operators Association, Swissport and Menzies Aviation have written to the Prime Minister to stress the absolute necessity of a flexible end to the scheme amid expectations of an easing to the economic lockdown.Between the airports, airlines and ground handling businesses, tens of thousands of staff are furloughed under the scheme.The industry is warning it will not be in a position tothem all to work at the current end date next month and is likely to make a signicant number of the redundancies the JRS was designed to avoid.Without a flexible or tapered end to the scheme, the industry will not be able to support the economic recovery, the letter warns.FSB boss Mike Cherry said: “Today’s figures are a stark reminder that millions of jobs are stake in the weeks ahead. As we look to recovery, small firms must be allowed to get back on their feet one step at a time –  million jobs depend on it.“Our members are telling us in no uncertain terms that part-time furloughing is the way forward - allowing staff toto work for a few days a week while remaining furloughed for days when they’re not required.“The economy is not suddenly going to start firing on all cylinders overnight. Adjustments to the job retention scheme need to reflect that fact.“Government must avoid applying sector straightjackets that don’t work for small firms. There are far too many businesses that don’t fit neatly into one box, like small companies that mainly supply to hotels, but aren’t classed as hospitality firms.“We need to see these changes made from the beginning of June as small businesses begin to restart. Orders are going unfulfilled because a few hours work doesn’t justy bringing somebody off furlough.Businesses can’t even quote for jobs to be completed once restrictions are eased. Time is of the essence.”Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies said Sunak should look at offering dferent furlough rates to workers in sectors of the economy which can begin reopening as part of the coronavirus recovery plan.He said there was an incredibly dficult and fine judgment to be made as some sectors of the economy were unlikely to ever fully recover.The respected think tank boss said: One of the big questions for Government in moving away from furlough policy is the extent to which it is able to do that dferentially by sector.You might think that the current system of really quite generous payments is appropriate for those sectors that have to remain locked down - so supposing you work in a bar or a restaurant you might think thats reasonable.The IFS also presented new research that revealed Britains lowest paid workers are in jobs that are least able to do remotely - exposing how the coronavirus lockdown has hit the poorest the hardest.The think tanks Rob Joyce said it is easier to work at home in higher paid occupations such as corporate managers, business managers, scientists, engineers, business associates and customer services.But lower paid jobs such as hospitality jobs, farming, sales, leisure and travel jobs are much harder to do from home, making “a lockdown especially problematic for lower earners on average”.Meanwhile new figures from the Office for National Statistics gave a rare positive boost, showing more than three quarers of firms in the UK were still trading despite the lockdown.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But a Boris Johnson ally has warned that just baby steps will be announced by the Prime Minister and the public should expect some measures to continue for months. The Covid- lockdown was formally extended on Thursday for another three weeks following a review, and parts of it could be lted every two weeks. When the Prime Minister addresses the nation on Sunday night, he is expected to announce his roadmap for easing restrictions while still trying to prevent infections. But the lockdown is set to remain in place until at least June as outbreaks in care homes and hospitals have made large-scale changes before then too dangerous.to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at mirror email -after the press conference every evening. The lockdown is facing a major test from a long weekend of warm weather and concerns of mixed messaging ahead of Mr Johnsonaposs announcement, as Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales weigh whether and when to make changes of their own. The Prime Minister has been urged to reveal a timeline and identy specic dates when certain measures will be lted amid fears for the economy and businesses, although ministers have warned that only modest or limited moves are likely. The UK is past its peak and the number of confirmed cases and deaths trending down. However, it has the highest death toll in Europe - more than , - and the second highest in the world behind only the US. There are fears a second wave could eruptthe restrictions are eased too soon and Britons donapost follow social distancing rules. The Mirror reported this week that the Government has a five-stage exit strategy staggered over the next six months, and a -page blueprint has been drawn up to get the country back to normal. Here are the changes that are expected from Monday. Monday Mr Johnson is expected to set out a rough timetable for lting key restrictions such as reopening schools and shops, but will stress that tough milestones must be reached before that can happen. He is likely to announce that people will be allowed unlimited exercise from Monday, ending the once-a-day restriction that has been in place since the unprecedented lockdown came into effect on March . The blueprint called for employees to be encouraged toto workplaces that have stayed open during the lockdownsafe.  Guidance for adapting workplaces to make them safer could be introduced. The Government could also allow places of worship, including churches and mosques, to open for private prayer but not for gatherings of groups. It is possible that garden centres will be given the OK to partially reopen, at least, although this is said to be one of the most contentious issues within cabinet. There may be further guidance on the use of outdoor spaces including open-air markets, high streets and cemeteries. Walesapos First Minister Mark Drakeford said lockdown restrictions in the country would continue for a further three weeks, with three modest adjustments from Monday.  People will be allowed to exercise more than once a day but they must not travel to do so, with the exercise beginning and ending at home. The second change is to allow garden centres to reopenthey can observe social distancing rules. Local authorities will also be able to begin planning how to open libraries and municipal recycling centres. Mr Drakeford said on Friday: These very cautious changes will apply to everyone other than the , people in the shielding group. We continue to urge people who are over , or who have an underlying health condition, or who are pregnant, to continue to take extra care. May   Rail services are set to increase to about % of the normal timetable later this month as part of the gradual easing of the lockdown, it is reported.\u2028 Sources told PA there will be a gradual increase from May . Rail unions have been involved in talks about the safety of workers and passengers when more trains run.\u2028 Some areas might see aof similar services to a Saturday. Rail bosses and Government sources told the BBC that services will be increased to about % of the normal timetable - from about % - to ensure the railways are able to cope with a rise in passengers as peopleto work. End of May start of June  The blueprint outlines a phasedof primary schools in England from the start of June, starting with Year . Families, shared homes and people living alone could be allowed to expand their household bubble and mix with others. End of June According to the five-stage plan, a phasedof secondary schools in England would begin before the summer holidays. Small team sports such as five-a-side football could be allowed, along with outdoor gatherings of fewer than  people.  Cafes with outdoor seating could reopen while outdoor sports such as golf, tennis and fishing might resume. Premier League football matches could be played behind closed doors. End of August start of September Pubs, bars and restaurants could gradually reopen near the end of summer, although customers would be expected to follow strict social distancing rules. Greene King chief executive Nick Mackenzie has said beer gardens will most likely be the first areas to reopen in pubs due to social distancing rules. October This is when fans could be allowed to attend football matches again. Gyms could be allowed to reopen. But any further lting of restrictions to get back to normal le would be in doubt amid fears of a second wave of coronavirus or an outbreak of seasonal flu. aposItaposs a bit of a shamblesapos The plans are due to be finalised over the weekend before Mr Johnson makes his televised address at pm on Sunday. Earlier this week, a Government source told the Mirror: “It’s a bit of a shambles. “Nobody can quite agree what to do and when to do it. Somebody comes up with a bright idea, but the practicalities get in the way.  We’re not South Korea.” Mr Johnson will keep Britain in lockdown until at least June after he was warned that it is too dangerous to make any signicant changes due to outbreaks in care homes and hospitals. He told his cabinet that he would proceed with “maximum caution” and modest changes before the end of May. It is possible that he could tighten other restrictions, such as tougher border controls, and reimpose restrictionsnecessary. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said the stay-at-home order for . million of the most vulnerable people may have to be extended beyond  weeks. A Government source told the Times: “It is baby steps taken slowly and only when it’s clear they can be taken. Plans to allow households to mix in a social bubble have slipped down the order of priorities because more work is needed, a source said, adding: “How do you enforce it  It could easily lead to a spike in transmissionit goes wrong. The Prime Minister could lt parts of the lockdown every two weeks under plans being discussed by ministers, thereported.  It said he is expected to give Britons a rough timetable for reopening schools and shops, but will describe tough milestones must be reached first. He is not currently planning to allow garden centres to fully reopen from Monday despite pressure from the industry, and bars, restaurants and indoor events are expected to be among the last things on the list. After each step, Mr Johnson will assess the impacts before risking further easing, as experts say it will take two weeks to produce reliable data. A Government source told the : “It means we could lt restrictions once a fortnight rather than reviewing the lockdown every three weeks, as is currently the case.

It probably did not feel like victory: it was a year until he could go home, and when he did he met for the first time a daughter who was almost  years old, and a we as changed by the war as he was.John was a furniture salesman who had been conscripted in . He landed in France just after D-Day. His best mate was blown up beside him while they fought through the orchards of Normandy. He drove a Bofors gun through France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, liberated a satellite camp of Bn, crossed the Seine, the Elbe and the Rhine, took members of the SS prisoner, and after ing home barely mentioned any of it. But months after VE Day he and his we, Gladys, thanked Winston Churchill for his leadership and backed his opponent, who promised sweeping change. They voted to create the NHS, to expand the welfare state, to be at peace with Europe. John was my Grandad. He spent most of his le in Dover, where he could see France on a clear day. He never went there again, on the grounds heaposd been once and it was horrible. He died nearly  years ago. His experiences went with him, apart from the few bits he shared with us. He never wore his medals the whole war, for him, was hell. He and many others reflected on those  years and opted to build a better, fairer world. Whether they really grasped the momentous nature of their decisions I donapost know, but the peaceful, prosperous nation all our families have enjoyed was the result. My grandparents were born into a world where women had no vote, wives could be raped by their husbands, and any employer could sack or harm a worker with impunity. Sixty years later, I was born in a true democracy with citizens protected equally by law, educated by the state, and cared for by the taxpayers. VE Day matters not just because it marks the end of something vile, but because it was the start of something great. And  years on, it is slipping from our grasp.  Commentators call the NHS a cult. Wealth-generators funnel their taxes overseas. Parents take their children out of schools turning them into citizens of the future, and take them on package holidays where they become the next batch of cancer patients instead.We fight, furiously, for the right to poison ourselves with additives, pollution and junk food. We demand the right to be fat. A third of us are obese, another third overweight. We are the most bloated country in western Europe, and now we have the coronavirus death rate to match. We show our appreciation to the medics working to save us from this pandemic by sending them doughnuts, not PPE. We give £m to a -year-old man plodding up and down his garden to help the NHS, but reject any suggestion of adding .p to our income tax rate to provide an equal amount, because it does not include the same dystopian entertainment.We vote, not for a better world, but for lower taxes, higher house prices, fewer people of a type we do not approve of.

After six years of toil, sweat and adversity a nation bruised by war had reason to celebrate. We stood together in the face of tyranny and aggression. Our survival was never certain. In the words of that other famous war leader, the Duke of Wellington, it was a “damn close run thing”. A generation of Britons were tested to their limits. To survive the war and emerge victorious required guts, stamina and heroism. This great collective endeavour was led by our pilots, sailors and troops. Yet it also needed the dedication of factory workers, Bevin Boys in the mines and Bletchley Park code breakers. And it rested on the spirit of the Blitz and the solidarity of our allies in the Commonwealth and beyond. Resilience If not for the coronavirus we would be paying tribute to this great national effort with pageants, processions and parties. But at the moment we should be commemorating the resilience of a previous generation our generation has been presented with its own era-defining challenge. Our present situation is not directly comparable to the sacrice of those who lost their lives in the war but we can be inspired from this proud chapter in our history. Then, as now, the nation has responded by coming together for the national good. Then, as now, we are being asked to make sacrices we never expected to make. And then, as now, we have discovered how the bonds that unite us can be strengthened in the face of adversity. The struggle against the coronavirus is far from won.

Tearful Caryn Joyner said she could not understand how the government allowed people to visit BQ but not their critically ill children in hospital. Her son Shay Joyner, , was cycling to pick up some pain relief for a sore tooth on Saturday night when he was struck by a car. The young dad, who has a five-year-old son, was rushed to intensive care and is now in a coma. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.       On Monday, doctors said his condition had worsenedl. But despite his injuries Caryn, from Basildon, Essex, has not been able to visit him due to the current coronavirus restrictions. The mum-of-three said: I’ve been told I could only visitit was end of le, but he is critical and can become fatal at anytime, so I’m only allowed to see himhe dies. I am in a state of shock. I totally understand not being able to visit because of the pandemic but he hasn’t just come into AE, he is in a coma. He is my son, my world. I just want to be able to send him a video that can be played to him telling him I love him, or see him through a window.  Shay was initially taken to Basildon Hospital on Saturday following the incident at around .pm. Caryn got a call from officers telling her what had happened and that she should go to Basildon Hospital where her son was. But because of the hospital’s lockdown measures, she wasn’t allowed to see Shay, except briefly as he was being moved to intensive care.  Caryn had barely enough time to kiss her son on the head and tell him she loved him. Shay was then moved to Queen’s Hospital, Romford, on Sunday - and Caryn said she received an update to say he was stable. But  hours on, Caryn received a call explaining how Shay’s condition had worsened. Caryn believes next-of-kin should be able to see non-covid  patients who are in a critical condition. She said: They can open BQ and The Range but I can’t see my son in a coma  His five-year-old son is also wondering why his daddy hasn’t been in touch.

The two young princesses, Elizabeth and Margaret Rose, had known for some time that this moment was coming and that victory in Europe was assured. But, as they joined the King and Queen on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on VE Day in , the sheltered young royals were unprepared for the electric atmosphere and sense of release bubbling from the crowds. They were desperate to be part of it. A few hours later, Lilibet, , and her -year-old sister sneaked out of the palace with the blessing of their parents, who agreed “the poor darlings” deserved a little fun at last. Then, going almost unrecognised, they found themselves dancing with strangers, joining a rowdy conga and cheering up at their waving parents as they appeared again on the balcony. “I think it was one of the most memorable moments of my le,” the Queen would recall in a rare and candid TV interview in . “I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief.” The Queen will share her memories in a VE Day th anniversary address at pm today – the same time her father spoke to the nation in .  Earlier in the day, Prince Charles will read extracts from his grandfather George VI’s diary. King George VI and Queen Elizabeth had steadfastly refused to leave London during the war, despite an extremely near miss when the Luftwaffe pulverised the Buckingham Palace Chapel in September . The princesses remained at Windsor Castle and their parents joined them a few days before, knowing victory was imminent. The King had been working on his victory address with voice coach Lionel Logue, who had helped him overcome his stammerOn Monday, May , the royals ed to Buckingham Palace as it was announced that Tuesday and Wednesday would be VE Day public holidays.  Huge crowds began descending on London overnight, awaiting Prime Minister Winston Churchill’s announcement the following afternoon. The King wrote in his diary: “The day we have been longing for has arrived at last and we can look back with thankfulness to God that our tribulation is over.” Loudspeakers and floodlights were being erected in The Mall and the palace balcony – newly strengthened after the bombings – was decorated with crimson and gold drapes. Princess Elizabeth, a mechanic and driver in the Auxiliary Territorial Service, dressed in her unorm while Princess Margaret wore a light-coloured jacket and skirt. Then, after a morning of tense anticipation, the royals listened to Mr Churchill’s pm speech from Downing Street.  They could hear the crowds going wild outside as Churchill ended with the words: “Advance Britannia! Long live the cause of freedom! God Save the King!” And then they made the first of many balcony appearances that day, including one with Churchill himself. Lionel Logue and his we, Myrtle, arrived at the palace to dine with the royals before Logue gave the King’s speech a final run-through. By now the princesses were pleading with their parents to be allowed to join the party. Finally, they agreed to let them leave in a group of , including some guards officers, the Queen’s cousin, the Hon Margaret Rhodes, and lady-in-waiting Jean Woodroffe. They were also joined by Lord “Porchy” Porchester, who later become the Queen’s racing manager, and Peter Townsend, the king’s equerry who sparked a national crisis a decade later when, though a orced man, he won Princess Margaret’s heart.  Speaking in , Margaret Rhodes revealed: “We crossed the forecourt at Buckingham Palace and got to the railings and there were these masses and masses of people. There was a general thing of, ‘We want the King and Queen!’ which we all frantically joined in with. “We were amazed when, five or  minutes later, the windows opened and they came out on to the balcony. “It was like a wonderful escape for the girls. I don’t think they’d ever been out among millions of people.” In  the Queen herself revealed: “We were terried of being recognised, so I pulled my unorm cap well down over my eyes. “But a Grenadier officer among our party... said he refused to be seen in the company of another officer improperly dressed – so I had to put my cap on normally.” The Queen was recognised by at least one eagle-eyed member of the crowd though – a teenage lad who stole a dance.  Ronald Thomas’s story only emerged in  when the partially fictionalised movie A Royal Night Out featured a similar incident Ronald, then , from Harrow, had travelled to London with a pal. In Trafalgar Square, he recognised Elizabeth. His grandson Thomas, , explained: “They danced together for a few minutes – just a merry dance. “She denied her identity at first but he was so sure, he said, ‘I’d recognise your face anywhere!’ “Eventually she admitted it but told him to keep it quiet. “He felt a strong sense of civic duty to the future monarch, which is why he didn’t expose her then, and why he has been very bashful about it since. “There were several big blokes with her, chaperoning, and after a few minutes they all moved on.

Luke fell ill on December  last year and was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis, the most dangerous strain of the disease.It has a fatality rate of up to  per cent and can often lead to sepsis.Survivors may suffer lasting long-term effects and many have to have limbs amputated due to gangrene caused by blood poisoning. He was initially taken to Airedale Hospital but was transferred to Sheffield by the Embrace team, a mobile ambulance unit who transport seriously ill children across Yorkshire.  Luke was placed in an induced coma and was dependent on a ventilator and dialysis machine. Family, friends and their colleagues at Skipton RUFC - where Luke played - have collected more than £, for the Mortimer family through fundraising efforts. The money will enable them to adapt their home for Lukeaposs disabilities and buy specialist medical equipment. It will also cover living expenses as Adam, a self-employed builder, has been unable to work while caring for Luke.

The country took to the streets to celebrate the end of years of fighting, bombings and death. Those who were there share their special memories of VE Day. Marion Parry, , of Aberdare, Wales Marion lived with her parents, Ethel and Ernest. Her dad joined up as a gunnery soldier with a Royal Artillery anti-aircraft regiment defending naval bases in Scotland, near the Orkney Islands. This family photo was taken when he ed to Wales, in June , to meet baby Marion. Marion, far right, honours May ,  in verse... A bonfire stands upon the hill for everyone to see, The daily news reads, “Peace at last! We’ve won the victory.” Flags are flying, people singing, children start to shout. But I am only four years old, I don’t know what it’s all about. Soldiers in their khaki suits, relief spread on their faces. Shake hands, join arms with “ GI Joes” of many dferent races. “We’re going home at last!” shouts Bill. “New York, here I come!” “Oh! What will we do now ” moans Dai. “Who’ll give us chewing gum ” My Mickey Mouse gas mask will finally be put away, In the hope that it may never again see the light of day. The air raid shelters will soon come down, As peace s to our small town. The village band plays a Glenn Miller tune to set feet tapping with a swing. And pit hooters sound throughout the hills, while church bells start to ring. A radio plays Vera Lynn, as she begins to croon, “There’ll be bluebirds over the white clfs of Dover,” That ever-popular tune. It’s time at last, the torch is lit and the bonfire starts to burn. Crackling wood and soaring flames light up each face in turn. A new tomorrow will soon dawn and war will fade away, But we must never forget the price that we all had to pay For freedom and the right to live in peace at last. However many years go by, we remember the past. Now,  years on, we’ll remember, and celebrate with tea. There’ll be plenty to eat and plenty to drink, more than enough for you and me. But we will still stop and wonder how we survived each day, Of rationing and coupon books and queues along the way. Yes, the time has long since passed but it seems no time ago, That I still remember VE Day, When I was only four.” Gillian Holding, , Sheffield I was nine and living on Firth Park Road on VE Day and we couldn’t have a street party as the road was too busy with trams, buses and tanks. The houses all had Union Flags outside. My family had a very tatty flag which had been used for the  celebration.  Opposite our house was a Chinese laundry and I remember the anticipation of seeing which flag they would hang out – it was the Union Jack! As there was no street party, my aunt gave us some money and coupons to help arrange a party on a green, open space nearby. We had sandwiches and cake but I was very upset that the younger children had jelly too – it would have been such a treat.My father went on the train to London and had an amazing time with everyone smiling, laughing anddancing.Pamela Broadhurst, , Dorset This is a photo taken on VE Day. I was five and my brother was eight but I still remember the day. In the evening there was a party in a marquee for the adults – but us kids stayed up anyway. All our friends and neighbours from Eric Avenue in Padgate, Warrington, were there. It was such a happy time, though growing up during the war meant I really didn’t know any other way of le. You’d hear the air raids and knew it was time to run home. It was just what we did. But the first time we could have sweets, it was amazing – the queues used to go round the block. There were few men there. My father had been in the Army from the beginning and was still away. I now live in Dorset with my husband Colin, , and we will soon celebrate our th wedding anniversary. Sheila Doughton, , Wolverhampton  I was aged six when the war started. On VE Day we had a big street party. One of the neighbours, Mr Emery, brought his piano out into the street and his we played it. All the surrounding streets had lorries driving round with the children on the back who were all dressed up. Each truck had a theme, ours was The Victory Queen. Claire, being the eldest of us, was the Victory Queen... we were all dressed in red, white and blue. The lorries were driven round the surrounding streets and through the hospital grounds. We children were so excited and we all really enjoyed the day.  We had a small shelter in our back garden at home and some nights we used it and other nights we stayed in the pantry under the stairs. Our ARP Warden, Mr Courtney, used to come down our entry during the air raids and shout at Mum through the pantry window: “Are you all all right, Mrs Bate ” In my mind I can still hear the German planes flying over us – the hum, hum, hum sound that they made. You could tell they were loaded. We used to hear the whistle bombs being dropped and us children would go out the next day to pick up the bits of shrapnel that had fallen. Thomas Spittle, , Gamesley, Derbyshire  Thomas was the first baby born in Manchester on VE Day – and his middle names, Victor and Edward, are a reminder of his special birthday. Here, he reveals what sharing such a famous date means to him... I am extremely proud of being born on VE Day. My mum, Margaret, told me she went into labour the day before, when everyone was preparing for a party outside the house. I was born one or two minutes after midnight on the day itself, I just made it! I weighed lb oz. I was so big the nurse said Hitler must have known I was coming! Mum held me in her arms as she watched the bonfires and the dancing in the streets with my older sisters.  We lived on Wendover Road, in Urmston, Greater Manchester. My parents had a five-bedroom house with a big cellar where they used to go when the sirens went.I remember bunk beds there when I was growing up. My dad Jack worked as an ambulance driver in Kent during the war but he made it back up for my birth.My mum and sisters said he’d bring up boxes of fruit for them. They used to share them around kids on our street. I now have six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren and I’ve talked to them about the meaning of my name. It’s important not to forget. VE Day meant a lot to a lot of people. The war should never have happened, it caused a lot of hardship all over the world but at least we won. Five years ago we had bunting and flags out, and all the family here to celebrate the th anniversary of VE Day as well as my birthday.This year I’ll be  but the celebrations will be more muted as we are facing a dferent battle today. Val Nuttall, , Stockport, Cheshire  My mother, Hannah Kathleen Davies, was in the Auxiliary Territorial Service as a PT instructor when war broke out. My father, Thomas George Beaumont, was a Lieutenant in an artillery regiment. They met when they were stationed together at a camp near Derby before he was posted abroad. I was born on VE Day. At the time, my mother was living with his family at the corner shop they owned. When Mum went into labour, Dad’s sister was sent to the phone box to ring for a taxi to take her to the nursing home where she was to give birth. My aunt had been looking forward to going to celebrate victory but spent the day and night running between the shop and phone box, checking the progress of the labour, relating it to Grandma. Luckily, she didn’t hold it against me that she missed out on the fun and became my godmother. The s and s brought challenges of growing up but I was lucky to be born when resilience and optimism were a huge part of the national character. This is a photo of myself and my parents, in about June . Dad’s still in unorm, my mother looks gorgeous... and I was too young to spoil it! Joy Lennick, , who now lives in Alicante, Spain  Joy wrote a memoir called My Gentle War about being an evacuee. The eldest of three kids, her dad was in the RAF. She recalls: “When peace was finally declared, Dad was still serving, Mum was working as a welder and we children were evacuated to our third place. I had another brother, named Royce, as Dad was stationed nearer to home. “We were overjoyed to be reunited as a whole family, while mourning the loss of Dad’s youngest brother Bernard.  “I can recall the feeling of euphoria which swept the country when the war ended. “Our parents took us on the train to London. There were bonfires, like beacons of hope, blazing in back gardens and flags waving everywhere.We watched, entranced, a huge firework display from Westminster Bridge, and giggled as sailors climbed lampposts and kissed as many girls as they could catch! “Goodness knows what time we arrived home, tired but so happy.” Joyce Hughes, , Hale, Liverpool  During the war I lived in a terraced house in Vale Road, Woolton, with my parents Teresa and Jack Langley, and six brothers and sisters. Dad and Mum worked in a components factory. I remember sirens and air raids. We used to go to a family with a shelter or to one in Gladstone Street. We were only children, so it seemed like a big adventure. We were still going to school but had to carry little gas masks with us. Once, in  when I was , we came out and a bomb had dropped on the next street. It only demolished one house but when we went back to ours, Dad went to put the key in the front door and it just fell backwards into the house.The windows had gone. There was soot everywhere but our little dog lived through it. On the day the war ended there was a big bonfire at the bottom of the road, someone had pushed a piano out and everyone was singing and dancing. A few days later we had a street party in the afternoon. I have no idea where the food came from but there was plenty to go around. Rex Wellard, , Chigwell, Essex  Rex was evacuated to three dferent places in six years and has written a book called Don’t Forget Your Gasmask about his experiences. He says: “I had been home with my family for about five weeks when at daybreak one Monday, we were woken up by a cacophony of noise coming from the river.The boats moored on the Thames were sounding their steam horns and many gave hoots emulating the Vin Morse code. ‘That’s it!’ my dad said. ‘The war’s over.’ “My friend and I caught a train to London and squeezed down The Mall to join thousands in front of Buckingham Palace.The crowd were chanting for the Royal Family, who came on to the balcony with Churchill. The loud cheering and flag-waving was years of tension being released. “In Shaftesbury Avenue, an American Forces club had its windows open wide and a gramophone blared out music. Soldiers leaned out calling to girls as a long conga line snaked about. “They threw fire-crackers down, too. A middle-aged couple got a shock when one went down the man’s sweater and exploded, blowing a hole in it. He was unharmed but his we was most annoyed.” Bill Bennett, , of Kidderminster  He joined the Merchant Navy at  but was seconded to the Royal Navy. He worked on Plutoto allow petrol to be pumped from the UK to France and was mentioned in Dispatches for his bravery for helping a wounded colleague. There were a lot of shells and e-bombers and I wasn’t allowed to carry a gun as I was from the Merchant Navy. But I was too busy getting on with the job to be scared. I just remember tremendous noise, as well as hundreds of planes, and the smell of cordite. We sailed back to Folkestone on May  but got back into the harbour late so stayed aboard the ship. Next morning as I went on deck, there was a buzz of excitement. A group of men on the quay were talking and looking at a paper. I shouted “What’s happening ” They said the war was over in Europe and the Germans had surrendered. Looking around you could see people shouting and talking to one another and the excitement and buzz was unbelievable. After five years of tension, there was such relief for all. The next two days were spent celebrating on land. We felt a great lt. But our war was far from over.Bill, a Royal British Legion member, was involved in the Japanese campaigns and was finally demobbed in November .Don Sheppard, , Royal Engineers and stDivision  My ision was involved in the last big battle on May , , in Bremervorde, north-west Germany – known as the final surrender.As the attack was progressing, many of the enemy surrendered to our troops, which was the beginningof the final capitulation of all of Germany’s armed forces on VE Day. My thoughts at the time, after surviving five years of war, was relief that nobody was shooting at us any more. I’m sure the German soldiers felt the same.  Then, of course, I celebrated the event with a tipple or two. But I found myself thinking, what a futile way of le, killing one another.There was a sadness of all those comrades who would never be going home, like I was longing to do. The casualty figures from my ision alone from D-Day to VE Day was , killed, wounded and missing. Let us remember with thanksgiving and honour all those who gave their lives in the pursuit of freedom. Sergeant Fred Foster, who died in  aged , by his son Steve Foster, , author of The Soldier Who Came Back  Dad joined the Army in May  and saw action in Norway in .Over five days of fighting in deep snow in the village of Tretten, the British were subjected to continuous mortar and machine-gun fire which they had no answer to. Armed only with rles, they were eventually overrun as tanks passed through them.Hand-to-hand fighting took place in order to hold the village but it was finally taken when most of the brigade were killed, wounded or captured. Fred was imprisoned in Stalag XXA, Thorn, Poland, where in , he and a friend undertook an escape to the Swiss border. At the border they were recaptured, harshly interrogated and eventually ed to the camp. From there, Fred was moved to Stalag  in Hohenfels, Baia, where he was finally liberated by American forces on May , . However, there were , allied PoWs released in Germany in May  and most would not get home by VE Day. The pure logistics of feeding, clothing and transporting them was a huge challenge. Documents show that Fred was given a day pass from his camp on May , so he was effectively still a prisoner but held by British authorities and he did not get home until May . He and his friends, who had spent more than five years as prisoners, were still in PoW camps in Germany on VE day and not out on the streets in their home towns celebrating. This is perhaps a little-known fact. Walter Taylor, , of Waterlooville, Hants, served as a private with the Tank Corps from . A D-Day veteran, he was awarded the Legion d’Honneur in   He says: “I volunteered at  because I hated my job in a Lancashire shoe factory. On D-Day we landed on Gold Beach and I saw some terrible sights. That night one of our drivers was sleeping under his tank when the Luftwaffe hit it. “He was the first of our casualties but not the last. I lost some great colleagues as we made our way through Europe, including Geordie, who looked after me like a second father. “We pushed on to the Rhine and I started to get the feeling we might be getting to the end – youthful optimism, perhaps. “Then, in May , we were in a wood near Luneburg Heath in Germany. There were lots of vehicles moving around – and I now know that was because the Germans were surrendering. At about midday on the th, our Sergeant Major came out and said: ‘That’s it, it’s all over.’  “We were told it was VE Day and were very pleased, obviously. But we didn’t have any booze to celebrate with so I just had a cup of tea. One of my mates was fed up and made a sign saying ‘VE Day and NO BEER’ and hung it on a tank. “So I’ve promised myself I am going to have a bottle of beer on Friday to mark this th anniversary. I’m going to toast all the lads who never came home.“ Walter was demobbed in , ing to join the police force. He married Vera and the couple had three children. He adds: “Before the coronavirus lockdown I was meant to be coming to London to lay a wreath on the Cenotaph. “But I’m hoping I’ll be able to do that on Remembrance Sunday in November instead.” Barbara Hurman, , from Aylesbury, Bucks, joined the Army at  and became a teleprinter operator in the Royal Corps of Signals  Following D-Day I volunteered to go abroad and joined the Central Mediterranean Forces. I was in southern Italy when news of the end of the war came but I never had a chance to celebrate. My unit was in transit, waiting to be posted to our next billet, so we weren’t allowed out. It was only afterwards I realised I had spent VE Day confined to barracks! As a member of the Royal British Legion, I was looking forward to taking part in the VE Day events in London this year. But now I will be celebrating at home as I didn’t get the opportunity to all those years ago. You don’t tend to hear so much about the work that women did to help win the Second World War. Women played a valuable role – at home and abroad – and that should be acknowledged more. Bernard Morgan, , from Crewe, Cheshire, was a codebreaker who found out about the German surrender via a telex two days earlier than most. He still has the original message  I landed on Gold Beach at .pm on D-Day – the youngest RAF sergeant to land in Normandy.I can still vividly remember seeing dead bodies scattered all over the beach as I came ashore, and that is a sight that will stay with me for ever. By May, , I was stationed in Schneverdingen in Germany – where I got advance warning that VE Day was coming. I got a telex to let me know that the war was ending and that the German surrender was imminent. I still feel very privileged.  I remember VE Day very well, the drinks just appeared from nowhere and we lit a bonfire, and had a massive party. It’s so important that we make the most of these opportunities to remember what happened – not just to celebrate the achievement but also to ensure that such horrors never happen again. Secret agent Odette Hallowes, by her granddaughters Sophie Parker and Nicole Miller-Hard Our French-born grandmother Odette was recruited by the British Government to join the Special Operations Executive and work undercover in occupied countries. After training, she joined SOE agent Peter Churchill in France but, in April , they were both betrayed, captured, and imprisoned. Odette was brutally tortured for information about her fellow agents but refused to say anything, saving their lives and enabling them to carry on their vital work.During her confinement in the notorious Ravensbruck bunker she did all she could to try to keep her mind and body active and retain her dignity. In the spring of , as the Allies were closing in, Odette, emaciated and extremely ill, was taken from Ravensbruck by the prison commandant, who had been instrumental in the extermination of , women.They went in his own car and she was told, ominously, that it would not be necessary to bring her things. She was sure her end had come and he would drag her into the woods and shoot her.  But it was not to be. On May , just days from the German surrender, the prison commandant handed her over to the American military base and her relief must have been immeasurable. We are sure that arriving home in England after two years of incarceration and knowing she was at last going to be reunited with her daughters must have been monumental for Odette. The sight of London’s streets hung with the glorious flags of military victory, and the joyous sounds of the VE celebrations would have affirmed that her hopes and dreams had finally become a reality. Odette was awarded the George Cross, an MBE and the Legion D’Honneur. Alec Borrie, , Slade Green, Kent  I was the youngest member of the st SAS and was with them for two years during the war. On VE Day I was in a transit camp in Chesterfield and the news came at about midday. I can sum up VE Day in two words: Getting drunk.  We went to a pub and I spent quite some time trying to strike up a conversation with another man from st SAS, until I realised I was actually looking at myself in a large mirror. Eileen Storey, , Norfolk  Every time I hear the lovely Vera Lynn sing The White Clfs of Dover, I am transported back to the day when I joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service at the age of . I became a very proud gunner.  We were positioned on the white clfs of Dover at the time when the V and V rockets, doodlebugs, were beginning to attack. Most of the crews were young girls. I still have lovely memories of friendships formed during the war. John Stuart Chapman, by daughter Jan Stewart, , London  My father was an Able Seaman in the Royal Navy and turned  on VE Day. His ship sailed into Plymouth harbour as the church bells were ringing out for the end of the war. But to him, it felt like everyone could have been celebrating his st. Dad, who had done some bell ringing, found a nearby church and rang a peal of bells himself. Dad, who was only  when he was called up, operated depth charges on destroyers. He didn’t really talk about the horrors he must have seen but he told us two stories. He thought he had been blinded when a depth charge exploded near him – but found he could see when his eyelashes, which had been stuck together, were trimmed. And one night in the Atlantic, a huge wave washed him overboard, but the next wave washed him back on, which he said was a miracle. Dad, who worked for BT after the war, died at  in . Lillian Cox and Doris Hobday , of Tipton, West Mids, are the oldest identical twins in the UK  The end of the war was announced on the radio, which our parents rented because we had hardly any money. At first we were so relieved but everyone was worried in case it started again or another war broke out. We lived in the Black Country, and worked in a factory. Even during the war we went to work each day, carrying our gas masks and ID cards. Everything was rationed.We had coupons for food, clothes, furniture. Times were hard but we got through it. When we came home from work we would hear the sirens and had to go straight to the shelter in our garden.  We used to sit there frightened while we heard the loud planes overhead. Our father was a firefighter looking after the streets to make sure everyone was safe. Doris had recently got married and her husband, Ray, was called up – he was a private in the Army and away for two years and eight months. When he went away he had a full head of hair. He came back bald and it never grew back. Towards the end of the war, a bomb went off just behind where we lived. It shook all the houses. Our mam was shouting: “Arrrrh, my bloody mantle is broken!” But we later learned that bomb killed three children and a doctor. When we heard the war had finally ended we were able to relax a little and start living our lives.

She joined the land army in , aged , and was sent from London to Cornwall.On VE Day, she was cutting cabbages to be sent on the train at midday, when the housekeeper called: “The war is over!”Needless to say, the cabbages were thrown into the air and they had a cabbage fight. They danced and sang “the cabbages never saw the railway truck”. Marie Scott, , New Malden, Surrey I was in Fort Southwick on D-Day and transmitted messages to and from the beaches. I went to London for VE Day with my friend Betty, aiming to walk down the Mall to Buckingham Palace. But most of London was determined to do the same thing. We met a human tide and were hugged and kissed by soldiers, sailors and airmen! People were delirious with joy. Marie is supported by The Taxi Charity for Military Veterans, taxicharity.orgEdith Pleasance, , from Wymondham, Norfolk, was on a delayed honeymoon For most of the war I worked in a factory making aircraft parts. One day a voice announced “Mrs Pleasance, please report to the main gate”. A friend was waiting for me with a telegram. My husband Jim had been captured by the Germans  months earlier at Anzio and incarcerated in a Stalag in Eastern Germany, so I was pretty certain he would have been on the much-publicised Death March.  I tore open the envelope and didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as I read: “ARRIVED SAFELY. SEE YOU SOON. JIM.” Jim and I had married on his first leave in  but we had no honeymoon. So after he arrived home – at am on April ,  – we decided to go to Plymouth. We were there on VE Day when we heard Churchill on the tannoy. Then it was announced that celebrations for all would be organised on Plymouth Hoe. The party was like six New Year’s Eves rolled into one. Si Liberman was a -year-old US airman stationed at Attlebridge airfield, near Norwich  The explosion of joy had not yet erupted. But there, in the heart of London, darkness was strangely absent on one city street.A stream of light illuminated almost an entire city block. Some happy soul had raised a blackout shade.And for the first time in nearly six years, it was done without fear of inviting an air raid warden’s citation or German bombs. That marvellous lighted scene, foretelling the end of Europe’s deadliest period, has stayed with me all these years. The date was May , . I was  then and a B- bomber radio gunner on a three-day pass from my air base outside Norwich, a five-hour train ride away.On an Underground train en route to Piccadilly Circus, I kind of got the picture after spotting a newspaper headline. “Unconditional Surrender Imminent,” it screamed. By pm the next day, it was official.  Standing on the War Ministry balcony above Whitehall at that hour, a beaming Winston Churchill flashed his usual V sign. This time, though, his V for victory was no symbolic promise. Hostilities with Nazi Germany were over. “This is your victory,” he told a huge crowd that had gathered. Cheers grew into one helluva party. People poured into the streets, shouting, dancing, embracing. They mounted double-decker buses and utility poles, waved flags, started bonfires and danced the hokey pokey around a statue of Queen Victoria. Sirens blared, car horns honked and church bells pealed. I found myself drawn to Buckingham Palace. A roar from the crowd and wild applause greeted the appearance of people on the balcony.  From where I stood among a mass of humanity, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, their princess daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret, and Prime Minister Churchill were a distant blur. That night floodlights illuminated Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament for the first time since the Battle of Britain began in . And Big Ben’s toll, signalling the official end of the war in Europe, was greeted by exploding fireworks and screaming sirens. The celebration went on for two days.

Lauren McLean, , was flying back from a Tenere to Birmingham when an hour into the flight she felt like she needed to push. An announcement asking for help was answered by a complete stranger - midwe Angela Chamberlain who was also ing home from her holiday. She became Laurenaposs saviour, helping her avoid giving birth until the flight was erted to Faro in Portugal and she would have access to a hospital, reports Birmingham Live.As Lauren lay on the floor of the plane, Angela took her weight as the craft landed to avoid adding to her discomfort. Little Oscar Jacob Wall was born only a few minutes later, weighing lb oz. But Lauren wants to warn other mums-to-be of the need for full insurance and the dangers of flying - even when, as in her case, they were medically cleared to do so.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email Lauren, from Marston Green in the Midlands, said Angela, a midwe at Walsall Manor Hospital, was her saviour. It was like a Hollywood movie, Angela said.I had to pin Lauren to the floor while trying to straddle her. An air hostess was looking out of the window so she could tell me the the exact moment we would land so we would brace ourselves and I could take the weight on my hands on the floor. You can watch Lauren talking about her experience on the above video and Angela is in a video further below. Both Angela and Lauren are big fans of BBCaposs Le and Birth series, which was recorded in Birmingham. The fourth episode at pm on Tuesday May  will feature posthumous footage of Birmingham Womenaposs Hospital and Childrenaposs Hospital neonatologist Dr Vishna Rasiah whose death from coronavirus was announced on April .  How the drama unfolded Trying hard not to give birth at , feet was the last thing administrator Lauren expected when she boarded aflight from Tenere to head back to Birmingham. Within five minutes of the jet landing in Portugal, she was in an emergency ambulance. And ten minutes later Oscar was born. The boy had only been in the country for  minutes but now qualies for a Portuguese passport. Proud dad Jake is hoping itaposs a sign Oscar could be the next Ronaldo. But because Oscar had to spend the first six weeks of his le in Faro Hospital on the Algarve, Lauren said she had a more serious agenda.  The holiday plan Laurenaposs end-of-winter holiday had been booked as a Christmas present when nobody had heard of Covid-. The dates were from February  to March . Having had medical clearance first - and knowing a friend had once flown back from Australia  weeks into her pregnancy - sheaposd never considered herself to be at risk from four-hour flights to and from the Canaries. But, having taken mother Adie on holiday to Tenere with sister Jordan and their respective partners, Lauren later began to feel unwell. A doctor in Tenere thought she had a urine infection and prescribed antibiotics. With ten weeks left before her due date, Lauren was looking forward to flying home and being back in her own bed. Angela was on the same flight home with husband Russ - having booked a late winter break for the two of them at short notice. She had never met Lauren before.  The need for tests As the end of her own holiday drew near, Lauren began to realise something wasnapost quite right. Iaposd had no contractions and no waters breaking, she recalled. I just had bad pains in my lower back, hips and thighs on Wednesday. We saw a doctor before our flight who confirmed a water infection and said we would be safe to fly on Thursday. I just wanted to get home and check it out there. The flight back Once on board, Lauren said she needed to start going to the loo regularly. An hour after take off I turned to my mum and said: aposI need to push!apos You just donapost realise how much pressure there is inside a plane. Ryanair staff put out a call for anyone with medical training and Laurenaposs sister Jordan overheard some passengers thinking there was a Covid- patient on board. There was a midwe on the flight and Lauren was adamant she saved her sonaposs le. I owe everything to Angela, she said. She was our saviour. Angela could feel the babyaposs head and said I was fully dilated. Angela told me I would not be having this child on the plane I needed to wait until the hospital, with him being ten weeks early. I was having no pain relief but Angela taught me how to breathe through the contractions.  Trying not to give birth Angela - who knows some of the midwives featuring in the hit BBC series Le and Birth filmed last summer at three city hospitals - didnapost respond to the medical call at first as she thought she might not be qualied. But when it became apparent there was no doctor on board, Angela told cabin crew she was a midwe and met Lauren in the toilet at the front of the plane. With all of the other passengers looking in their direction, Angela moved Lauren to the back of the plane and two doors were opened from the rear loos to provide a degree of screening privacy. She encouraged Lauren to lie down to try to tilt her pelvis backwards so gravity might help to keep the baby in. Lauren was then able to put one leg up on a chair normally used by cabin crew while mother Adie held her other leg up. Meanwhile, the plane was being erted to Faro. I was so trying not to give birth, said Lauren. The next half-hour was a blur of me breathing my le away and screaming that I needed to push, while breaking Jake and mumaposs hands. The midweaposs view Angela had to think counter-intuitively to try to stop Lauren from giving birth. I knew thatthe baby was born in the air at  weeks that would dangerous for the baby and possibly Lauren, too, she said. With no oxygen and not being able guarantee keeping him warm, he might not have been able to breathe on his own for long. I encouraged Lauren not to push. A mother-of-three, including two stepsons and a -year-old boy of her own, Angela has been a qualied midwe since  after previously managing a care home. Because she had booked a short-notice flight with Russ for an end-of-winter break alone in Tenere, the couple werenapost even sitting next to each other when Laurenaposs drama began. Russ didnapost even know what was happening, said Angela.  Lauren was experiencing a lot of pain and pressure and where she was sitting there was a danger the baby could have been born down the toilet. I had to spend a few minutes to get my working head on and decided to take her to the back of the plane where I asked her to lie down so I could examine her with all of the passengers facing away from us. The labour was well-established and I could see babyaposs head. But the only mask available would have been bigger than the babyaposs head and, had Lauren given birth, the only thing I might have been able to do would have been mouth-to-mouth. The stewardesses were outstanding and had two fleeces ready in case he was born. At this stage there were still three-and-a-half-hours of the flight left so they contacted the captain who found somewhere to make an emergency landing. I did the best I could do at the time and, on reflection, I donapost think I would have done anything dferently. But I do thinkLauren had had a full medical examination before leaving for the airport she would probably have been told not to fly.  The bumpy landing Having been holding Laurenaposs hands, Jake - a bricklayer - and mum Adie were told to sit down and put seat belts on. The plane made a safe, emergency landing at Faro - but at great risk to Lauren, baby and Angela since they could not be strapped in. Angela says: The plane wasnapost full because of the coronavirus, and everybody  was moved forwards so there were not as many people at the back. A stewardess told us when we were going to land. It wasnapost the best landing - I was kind of straddling Lauren and I put my hands on the floor to take the impact. Looking back, Lauren said: Within five minutes I was in an ambulance and ten minutes after that Oscar Jacob Wall arrived into our world at .pm. As soon as I got in the hospital they said I could push - and Oscar arrived after just three pushes! The journey home Being born in a foreign hospital on March  wasnapost the end of Oscaraposs debut drama. Given that he only weighed lb oz, medics wanted mum to recover and to see him grow before allowing them to fly home to Birmingham. But within days of his birth, the whole of Europe was going into Covid- lockdown. Spain and Portugal went into lockdown on March  and  respectively - before Britain followed suit on March . Even after six weeks of consistently putting on weight, doctors didnapost want Oscar to fly home with members of the public because of the Covid- risk. During Oscaraposs stay in neo-natal care in Faro Hospital, only one parent a day was allowed to visit him between am and pm due to Covid-. That was the hardest of times for us, but the nurses were incredible, said Lauren. Thankfully, Lauren was fully covered for her holiday. An air ambulance was then arranged through her travel insurance for Lauren, Jake and Oscar to fly back to Birmingham with a nurse, doctor and two pilots - leaving Adie to make her own way home via flights to Lisbon and then Stansted. Once back at Birmingham Airport on Wednesday, April , Lauren and Oscar had a five-minute ambulance ride tohome to Marston Green.

Parts of the country are set to hit C this afternoon, hotter than top tourist destinations including Monaco and Corfu. And Saturday could just shade it by reaching C and matching the highs felt on April  in Cornwall - the hottest day of , Met Office forecaster Greg Dewhurst told the .  However, stormy showers across East Anglia, southern England, south Midlands and Wales over both days could hamper the mood slightly.Regardless of the heat, many beaches and open spaces are likely to be largely empty as people stay at home due to the coronavirus lockdown.The south-east will be the warmest area today and could see C in London while Scotland will reach highs of C.  Northern Ireland will see the mercury rising to C, and northern England and Wales could each see peaks of C. Met Office forecaster Oli Claydo said: It will be a bright and warm day for most on Friday. “There will be some early morning fog in the Midlands and west of England, and scattered showers in Scotland, but that should clear by mid-morning. By the afternoon it is likely to be clear and pleasant for all, and could be pretty hot for most. “But this will start to change on Saturday as a cold front will move from Scotland, bringing scattered showers in parts. The temperature could drop as much as C by Sunday as Arctic air sweeps in from the north of the UK to bring rain and colder temperatures, with possible wintry showers in northern Scotland. Mr Claydon added: There is expected to be a drastic drop in temperature on Sunday, falling as low as C in London, and there could even be a chance of snow in hilly areas of Scotland, but it is unlikely to set.

Of course, people were going to get killed but the aim was to keep the numbers to the barest minimum with a strategy known as “steel not flesh”. Britain aimed to use its vast global reach, technology, science, and ­mechanisation in an effort to limit the number of men at the coal face of war. This meant creating huge air fleets, incredible material support for ­frontline troops and developing new means of communication. Never was there to be a greater period of scientic and technological invention. Even after the fall of France and the realisation that Britain now needed to create a much bigger army, it was agreed it should be  isions in size and no more – compared with the hundreds of the Germans and Soviet Union, for example. Unlike Germany, considerable manpower was to be kept in the ­factories rather than stripping them out for the front – so much so that until the autumn of , the priority for manpower in Britain was not any of the armed services, but rather, the Ministry of Aircraft Production. Only the US would produce more aircraft in the war. Britain went on to build a staggering , by . Having seen off the invasion threat in , Britain’s prime focus was to hurriedly rebuild the Army and to secure the Atlantic. The battle across this huge ocean was rightly identied as the most important theatre of the entire conflict because, for an island nation like Britain, almost everything reached its shores through these waters, whether from the US or from India or Australia. Fortunately, the Germans had pointlessly focussed on building a surface fleet before the war, even though it could never hope to rival those of the leading maritime powers, rather than building a sizeable U-boat force. By January , only six U-boats were operating in the Atlantic and the high tonnage of ships being sunk had fallen. During the invasion scare the previous summer and autumn, convoys had been crossing the Atlantic largely without protection but now convoys of merchant ships were once again being increasingly heavily escorted by destroyers and other anti-submarine warships. The Royal Canadian navy was also rapidly growing – and manned entirely by volunteers as were all its armed services. It was a contribution that rarely gets the credit it deserves. Prioritising scientic research and development also helped win this battle. One of the key inventions was the cavity magnetron, developed in , which allowed for greater detection of smaller objects by much smaller radar antennae. Instead of having huge ft high masts, radar could now be placed on to an aircraft or ship. It was a game-changing invention and one neither the Germans nor the Japanese ever knew we had developed. At the same time, further developments were being made in improving high frequency-direction finding – known as ‘huff-duff’ – as well as developments in the global tracking of shipping and anti-submarine weaponry. In March , two of Germany’s most successful U-boat commanders, Günther Prien and Joachim Schepke, were killed and, a third, Otto Kretschmer, was captured. Because the U-boat Arm was so small, these were big losses. Then, in May, an Enigma signal coding machine was captured with its codebooks and one of Germany’s two largest battleships, the Bismarck, was sunk, forcing the Kriegsmarine’s surface fleet to skulk back to port where it largely stayed for the rest of the war. Britain still had a long way to go before the U-boat threat was destroyed but by May , it had reached a point where it was no longer going to lose the Battle of the Atlantic. That was no small achievement and by early , with aircraft now ­operating with the cavity magnetron aboard from Iceland, northern Canada and Northern Ireland, the U-boats had been pushed further into the middle of the Atlantic, which took them longer to reach and made them less effective. It was true some convoys were still being hammered, but more than % were getting through unscathed. Meanwhile, Britain’s growing army was, with the help of Commonwealth forces from Australia, India, New Zealand, South Africa and Rhodesia, fighting German and Italian forces in the Mediterranean and Middle East. Italy had declared war on June , , and its forces invaded Egypt in September that year. In December, the small ,-strong Western Desert Force had counter-attacked and smashed two Italian armies – some , Italians had been captured by February . The British had also attacked Italian-held Abyssinia in East Africa and had pretty much won the day there by May . Germany had struck up an alliance with Italy so that the latter would expand and protect the southern flank of the Reich, but Mussolini’s forces were insufficiently trained and equipped for modern warfare. Smashed by the British, they were also given a bloody nose by the Greeks when they invaded there in October . Hitler felt he had no choice but to intervene. General Erwin Rommel was sent to North Africa with two and then a third ision while German forces also swept into the Balkans and then Greece. Honouring an earlier offer to the Greeks, Britain erted troops from North Africa across the Mediterranean but had neither the air support nor heavy equipment needed to see off the Germans. Most were evacuated from Greece in late April. It was a defeat for both Greece and Britain – as was Crete that followed – but it wasn’t all bad news and these losses need to be seen in their wider context. Crete cost the Germans terribly in terms of half their highly trained paratroopers and most of their transport aircraft – resources they would desperately need in the mammoth clash of arms in the Soviet Union, to be launched a month on in June , . A month later, Britain secured Syria, and rebellions in Iraq and Iran were put down. Later in the year, Rommel’s German-Italian forces in Libya were pushed back again. The Middle East, though important, was not a major oil-producer at the time and its supplies fuelled the British war effort there and in North Africa and no more.  Rather, the leading oil producers in the world – by a country mile – were the US and Venezuela, out of reach for the enemy and the right side of the world for Britain. Fuel was rationed at home but we still used four times as much domestically per year as Germany did in entirety. The biggest setback for Britain was Japan’s entry into the war and the losses of Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaya and Burma. Britain was simply under-prepared in the Far East – its hands were rather full in the west. On the other hand, Japan was unable to reach the jewel in the crown, India, while during the retreat Britain set alight the Burmese oil wells and denied their use to the Japanese.

A few months earlier, in June , the British had been smashed near Tobruk and sent packing. It was the lowest point of British generalship in the entire war: a needless defeat caused by bad command decisions and faulty tactics. That the Eighth Army avoided annihilation was largely due to the Desert Air Force, who had developed exciting new tactics for close air support – tactics that would be further honed by the end of the war. General Harold Alexander, Britain’s most experienced commander, and Montgomery were brought in, steadied the ship, then struck back, and this time decisively, sending Rommel’s forces speeding back across Egypt, Libya and into Tunisia. Meanwhile, a joint Anglo-US force landed in pro-Axis French Algeria and Morocco and moved in a pincer movement from the west. By this time, Britain had worked out its way of war, which was to use immense firepower, brought about by a marriage of air, land and sea power. It had realised that German troops always counter-attacked. The moment they did, the Allies would emerge from their foxholes and camouflaged positions and the full weight of their firepower would then rain down upon the Germans – immense artillery, low-level bombers and fighter aircraft, and,close enough, off-shore naval guns too. It meant using a stick to goad them in the first place, which was why being a British infantryman or part of a tank crew was so incredibly dangerous, but it did mean these troops were comparatively few in number. Only around % of the Army were infantry and % were in tanks. Some %, on the other hand, were service troops, maintaining and supplying those at the coal face with food, ammunition, new tanks, trucks, spare parts and medical supplies and so on. Tunisia fell in May , the same month U-boats were largely withdrawn from the Atlantic, which meant the British and Americans could plan operations more effectively as they knew pretty much exactly what supplies were likely to reach them whether in the Mediterranean or in Britain, where preparations had begun for the cross-Channel invasion of France in . In the meantime, British and American troops launched the largest-ever amphibious operation – in terms of numbers of men landed – against Sicily on July , . This was a phenomenally dficult operation logistically, but in a sign of growing confidence, air, land and naval forces worked together to conquer the island in  days, hastening the overthrow of Mussolini. The Allies then invaded southern Italy whilst also building up for Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy, which took place on June , , two days after Rome fell. Despite the Americanisation of D-Day, largely thanks to Hollywood, D-Day itself was a predominantly British show. All three service chiefs were British,  of the , warships were British, , of the , landing craft were British, two thirds of the aircraft were British and two thirds of the troops landed were British and Canadian. It is true that American industrial muscle was truly exceptional and yes, the United States did, in many ways, become the Arsenal of Democracy. It was, however, British cash that kick-started this process in  and  and lend-lease ­actually cut both ways: some % of all US supplies in the European Theatre of Operations were provided by us. The Liberty ship, the prefabricated ,-ton merchant vessels churned out by US shipyards, was designed by a Brit, Cyril Thompson, and the initial shipyards on the east and west coasts of the States built with British money. D-Day was, of course, a success, and British forces continued to play a key part in the war in Italy and north-west Europe until the end of the war. Air power remained key to British strategy, and while initially, bombing was inaccurate and underwhelming, by March , when Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris launched his all-out bombing offensive, Britain had pioneered new navigational aids such as Gee, Oboe, and the first ground-mapping radar, HS, and bombing accuracy improved enormously. The levels of destruction by the RAF’s night bombers were incredible, but regardless of the debates about the morality, it unquestionably had a profoundly detrimental effect on Germany’s ability to wage war. It also saved British lives. The Lancaster bomber and Mosquito were also two incredible designs that played big roles in the air war. What’s more, by the middle of , RAF Bomber Command was able to strike – with unequalled accuracy – not least  Squadron, who earlier on May  and  carried out the successful raid against the German dams. Britain’s approach to war never stood still. In the Far East, the demands were even greater. There were few places in the world more challenging in which to fight. Disease was re, infrastructure almost nonexistent, and the first attempts to re-invade Burma in late  and early  met with failure. Then came monsoon season and a pause for a reappraisal of approach. Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten became Supreme Allied Commander of South East Asia and appointed General Bill Slim as his Army commander. Slim reorganised his supply chains, created new forward units for treating malaria – a disease that struck  men for every one battle casualty – gave every single man jungle combat training, and insisted the RAF win air superiority, which they swtly did with the arrival of superior Spitfires in the autumn of . He dramatically improved morale and his men first withstood a Japanese attack at the Admin Box in the Arakan in north-west Burma in February , then fought a fighting retreat to Imphal in north-east India, before counter-attacking at Kohima and destroying the Japanese Fteenth Army. Part of Slim’s success was his continued harnessing of air power. By commanding the skies, the RAF was able to transport two isions to Imphal as well as make numerous supply drops. Slim pushed the Japanese back into Burma and in spring , he brilliantly caught them out at Meiktila. Mandalay and Rangoon fell soon after and Burma was once again back in British hands. Britain had formed the Pacic Fleet in August  and helped the Americans in the Pacic, not least at Okinawa, in April and May . British scientists also played a vital role in the development of the atom bomb. At home, meanwhile, another agricultural revolution had been going on. In , Britain had produced only % of its own food, but by , that figure was %. This enabled shipping that before the war had been used for food to carry arms and war material instead. Rationing was nothing like as bad as where on the continent. The main purpose was to ensure everyone got a fair and balanced diet. This in turn meant they were fitter and healthier and productivity increased as a result. Britain deserves to feel very proud of the contribution it made in the Second World War and its “steel not flesh” policy.

It celebrates the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany to the Allied forces and the end of World War Two in Europe.Millions of Brits celebrated the news on May  . Prime Minister Winston Churchill led the way with a radio broadcast, a speech to crowds gathered in London and an appearance on the Buckingham Palace balcony alongside the Royal Family. To mark the th anniversary, the traditional May Day bank holiday on the first Monday of the month has been moved to Friday May  for - what was supposed to be three days of celebrations. The end of WW in Europe By April  the Nazi regime was crumbling, with Allied and Soviet forces overrunning Germany from the west and east respectively. Nazi leader Adolf Hitler knew the end was close, and had heard what had happened to Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. Mussolini had been captured by Italian partisans on April . Three days later he was shot and his body hung upside down. The Fuhrer was eager to avoid a similar fate, and on April  killed his dog, his new we Eva Braun and himself in his Berlin bunker. German soldiers started to surrender first in Berlin, then in other parts of Germany and Europe. At .am on May , Nazi high command sent to Reims in France signed the unconditional surrender of German forces.  At first General Alfred Jodl, representing Nazi high command, wanted to surrender to Allied forces on the Western Front. However the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, refused and insisted that the Nazis on the Eastern Front must surrender to the Soviet Union, otherwise heaposd end negotiations. The Nazis agreed, and the total surrender was to come into effect the following day, May . VE Day celebrations Celebrations erupted once news reached Britain. It’s estimated that more than a million people celebrated on streets across the UK. Some of the largest crowds gathered in London, with people filling the roads from Trafalgar Square and Whitehall, up The Mall and to Buckingham Palace. In a rousing speech, Churchill told the amassed crowd: “God bless you all. This is your victory! It is the victory of the cause of freedom in every land. In all our long history we have never seen a greater day than this. Everyone, man or woman, has done their best. Everyone has tried. “My dear friends, this is your hour. This is not victory of a party or of any class. Itaposs a victory of the great British nation as a whole. The Prime Minister also appeared on the Buckingham Palace balcony alongside King George VI and Queen Elizabethas well as Princesses Elizabethand Margaret. The young princesses were also allowed to slip out of the palace and join the cheering crowds.  US President Harry Truman celebrated his st birthday on VE Day, and dedicated the victory to his predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt. He had died of a cerebral hemorrhage less than a month before VE Day on April . Russia celebrates the end of World War Two in Europe on May . Despite the euphoria, both Churchill and Truman were keen to stress that the war was still going.

My dad has a lung illness so I had been going out to get the shopping in.

I was also in the .% of people likely to be badly affected by coronavirus so how could this be so. I really didnapost expect it but it shows that anyone can get coronavirus. Lilyaposs ordeal began on April  when she began feeling shooting pains in her stomach and had her temperature soar to . degrees. Initially medics thought she had a kidney infection and sent home with tablets. But at am the next morning she was woke up with severe pain and vomiting. She said: I woke up and I was being violently sick. We went to A and E at the hospital and they still thought it was a kidney infection.  They performed so many tests, ultrasounds and CT scans, and they tested for coronavirus but it came back negative. The next day I was feeling much better and thought I had gotten over whatever it was. On Wednesday I was up and about on FaceTime to my family, walking round my bedroom, feeling much better then at pm my world flipped and I got another test result back to say that I did in fact have coronavirus and I was going to have to be taken to Raigmore in an ambulance. There was a room filled with doctors and nurses to see me and that was scary. I donapost remember anything after that. Lily was placed on a ventilator under sedation on April . The coronavirus had lodged in her stomach and Lilyaposs organs, including her heart, had began to swell up. But by April , Lily says a miracle happened and the ventilator could be removed as she was breathing by herself.

By pm I was on FaceTime to my family I have never been so thankful to see them in my le and by all the crying and “oh my gods” I know they felt the same. It didnapost really realise everything that had happened until I got home and saw all the messages I had missed on my phone.

The compound called liquiritin was found to have prevented the rapid replication of the virus strain in monkey cells, according to reports. In China, liquiritin is commonly used in traditional medicine and found in herbal liquorice tablets, although many scientists remain unconvinced of its benefits, local media reports. Liquorice extract is usually used for gastrointestinal and respiratory problems as well as a sweetener in food or drink.to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at mirror email -after the press conference every evening. The extract from liquorice, a flowering plant native to Asia, has proved effective in trials, according to a local media report. The Beijing research team has been using articial intelligenceto carry out its tests and speed up the process. The study has not yet been peer-reviewed. The research is being carried out by medical experts from Peking University and the Academy of Military Science. The team said in a statement: “We recommend liquiritin as a competitive candidate for treating Covid-.” Since the pandemic started, many patients have been treated with known antiviral drugs, but none have proved sufficiently effective against the new strain of coronavirus, which emerged in the city of Wuhan late last year.The new study said that it can also work as an antioxidant as well as having antidepressant, anti-inflammatory and therapeutic effects on heart disease patients.

Hopefully, when the time#s right and everybody is safe, we need to make sure we are ready to go.”Dundee have been heavily linked with afor striker Simon Murray, who is a free agent after leaving South African side Bidvest Wits last month, while a permanent move for St Johnstone midfielder Ross Callachan could also be on the cards.His loan spell at Dens was ended prematurely with a broken leg but impressed in his short time there and is out of contract in the summer.McPake has also never hidden his desire to see Hearts forward Craig Wighton back with the Dark Blues.The current concern for teams like Dundee in the lower isions, however, is how next campaign might look.The SPFL have begun a league reconstruction task force led by Hearts chair Ann Budge and Hamilton chief Les Gray to revamp the setup for the new campaign.Dens Park managing director John Nelms is part of the -strong reconstruction group but McPake admits he’ll be happy with whatever future is decided, as long as it benefits the game as a whole.He added: “My preferred option is that we just find a way to get something that works.“Look, we need to make sure everything is safe first.“Do I have a preferred option  I would love to be in the Premiership but we had a chance to do that ourselves this season and we failed.“If we had won the league, it would have been a given.“Butreconstruction happens, whatever way, I just hope they do it so that it suits the game going forward.“Would our input as managers help  But do we then ask players as well “It is a tough one. Do I want to be involved  No, I am happy to leave it to the powers-that-be and just concentrate on my job getting our squad ready so that when we do get the green light to go ahead we can do that.“I just want football back, I think society wants football back andreconstruction comes in then great.“But there are people out there risking their lives to save lives so they are the real important ones.” months free access to our web and ePaper pack including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53258072-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53258072-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53258072-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53258072-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"subscriber special this commemorative tele supplement marks 75 years since ve day articleisfree","story":"Today, May , sees the country commemorate the th anniversary of VE Day and The Tele is bringing you special coverage to mark this historic event.We have produced a special -page supplement looking back  years to when Germany surrendered after five years of bloody war.The supplement, available to Tele subscribers only, includes:And that’s not all – on Saturday we will also publish a special replica edition from the Tele on VE Day itself, available to our subscribers only.This special edition is a must-read as it captures the historic moment as it happened with reporting direct from the scene as the country took in the news of the victory that would bring the conflict to an end. months free access to our web and ePaper pack including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-woman-discovered-first-human-coronavirus","story":" June Almeida, who discovered the first human coronavirus, was the daughter of a bus driver from Glasgow.

to the Hoops in .Although members of the Red Army who weren#t even born by  will have likely seen Theo Snelders# shoot-out save from Anton Rogan before Brian Irvine fired himself and the   squad # bossed by Alex Smith and Jocky Scott # into the history books, there will be some who don#t know the full story of the Dons# run in the competition that year.The League Cup-winning Dons started their Scottish Cup quest away to eventual First Division mid-tablers Partick in what would turn out to be goal bonanza.There was no Willie Miller, Theo Snelders, Hans Gillhaus or David Robertson due to injury, while midfield maestro Jim Bett was suspended, meaning the likes of Michael Watt, Ian Robertson and Willem van der Ark all started.Callum Campbell scored for the Jags after two minutes, after the ball squirmed under Watt, before big Dutchman Van der Ark levelled from Alex McLeish#s low cross.In what was an underwhelming start to a thrilling cup campaign, centre-back Irvine # Miller#s heir apparent # then chopped down Campbell to give away a penalty, and Chic Charnley put the home side back in front.However, an angled finish from Brian Grant before the break made it - and seemed to extinguish any Thistle fire.In the second half, Van der Ark lashed home another, Jim Kerr headed Paul Mason#s cross into his own net, before Skol Cup hero Mason made it - # despite being brought down in the build-up to his lofted finish # and Van der Ark completed his hat-trick with a perfectly-placed low effort from the edge of the area.Smith and Scott#s charges got off to a shocking start at rain-soaked Pittodrie in this one, gting the First Division strugglersan opener from a free-kick hoofed from half-way which Tommy Turner turned past Bobby Mimms.Both sides hit the woodwork chasing the second goal of the game, with Charlie Nicholas also seeing a one-on-one effort saved.The Dons must have been given a rollicking in the Pittodrie dressing room at half-time, though. Hans Gillhaus headed the equaliser from Mason#s cross soon after the break, and # after a few close calls # Nicholas eventually smashed home from close range after the ball was poked through to him by Bobby Connor. Phew.Long-time skipper Willie Miller was again missing for this last-eight clash, during what was a frustrating season for the great one, and didn#t play again in Aberdeen#s Scottish Cup run. He had suffered a knee injury on Scotland duty against Norway in November , which would ultimately end his career.Still, the Dons # in what would become a procession to the final # made light work of the Jambos.Midfield dynamo Jim Bett scored the opener, cutting in off the left and sending an early shot past Henry Smith. The Reds were in charge, but John Colquhoun would later equalise after a stramash at a corner.After the break Aberdeen ran away with it, Stewart McKimmie, Nicholas and Gillhaus combining for their second, before final hero Irvine lashed home to make it -.The fourth saw Gillhaus nutmeg Walter Kidd out wide, before repaying the favour with a cutback for Nicholas to finish.Smith and Scott surprised everyone by including full-back David Robertson in their line-up for the last-four meeting at Tynecastle. He#d been out for months with a serious foot injury.Keeper Snelders also ed from a knee complaint. These s and sense of things coming together were perhaps, in hindsight, a sign Aberdeen#s glory day at Hampden was meant to be.In what turned out to be a rout, final hero Irvine opened the scoring when he turned home Nicholas# cross from close range after Alan Main had saved his first effort.Just before half-time, future Don Mixu Paatelainen headed a high ball into the Tangerines# area past his own goalkeeper to make it -.The Reds# third was another nightmare for United, when Freddy van der Hoorn # under  a little bit of pressure from Mason # comically hoofed the ball over Main from the edge of the area.There was no fortune about the goal to make it -, however, Dutch wizard Gillhaus taking down a long ball on the left of the box and thumping it low beyond the United goalie. Aberdeen were in the final at a canter.The part of story even the Dons fans who weren#t around to see it know.After a goalless  minutes, there was no other way to settle the Hampden showpiece other than penalty kicks. Dariusz Wdowczyk missed the Hoops# opener, before Grant failed to score with penalty number four for the Dons.Aberdeen#s Nicholas # set to join Celtic after the summer # was notably successful with his effort to level things at - and send the shoot-out to sudden death.On the unbearable tension of the moment from that point onwards, captain and penalty-taker number six McLeish told the Evening Express in January: “God, aye.the penalty, the penalty I had to take.“It wasn’t the winning penalty, but it was a pretty important one. It was number six.“Celtic had taken five, we had taken five and one player from each team had missed.“I rememberJocky Scott saying ‘who’s taking the next one ’ and I said ‘I’ll take it’.“He asked ‘are you confident you’re going to score ’ and I said ‘not really, but I don’t see anyone  volunteering’.“So I took the long walk up, decided to stick to my favourite position, hitting to the goalkeeper’s left as hard and accurate as I could. If I did that I knew he wouldn’t save it.“I scored. But I didn’t jump up and celebrate. I walked back thinking ‘thank … goodness’.”Eventually, Rogan#s penalty was saved by Snelders, before Irvine blasted the winner to secure the trophy.McLeish added: “By the time we got to - and Brian won it, the goalies were ing the wrong way and people were mis-kicking it and it was going in.“We thought it was never going to end.“Then Theo Snelders, as he said at his hall of fame induction, said he knew it was coming close to him taking one, so knew he had to save one – that was Anton Rogan.“It was a great, great save. Theo timed it really well.” months free access to our web and ePaper pack including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering key workers in inveraray","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsInveraray#s war memorial was lit up blue this week in tribute to the work being done by NHS staff and other key workers during the coronavirus crisis.The tribute was organised by Inveraray#s branch of the Royal British Legion Scotland.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs.

What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall.

But I have lost my job and can’t afford to feed my kids right now.’ You could tell that he was absolutely mortied and so humble. So many people have lost their jobs.“We have told pensioners not to answer their door when we deliver, but one old lady insisted. We told her she shouldn’t be doing that, but she replied: I just want to say thank you’.“The older generation are so apologetic when asking for help, they all say: I’m sorry to bother you’.”Christian charity Via Wings is offering food deliveries and befriending to anyone who is self-isolating, elderly, vulnerable, an NHS employee, key workers, or those financially impacted by Covid-.Volunteers observe social distancing guidelines and food is carefully wiped down before being packed. Food and toiletry donations can be made at Eurospar, Supervalu and Vivo in Dromore and Tescosand Lidl in Banbridge.Via Wings works with local schools and churches, social workers, care workers and other agencies.“Working in unity is what our grandparents used to do, and that is what we need to get back to doing, caring for each other,” Gail added.“There is no ownership, we are just working together.”CASE STUDYNEIL MUSGROVEPicture# NEIL MUSGROVE SUBMITTED BY LEEDS CARESAN ULTRA-MARATHON runner is putting his best foot forward after several running events planned for this year had to be cancelled or postponed.Last year Neil Musgrove ran seven ultra-marathons and with none looking likely for this year he is running one in his back garden.He is doing a mile a day in his back garden according to his running watch and is hoping to reach his goal of the  mile starting distance for an ultra marathon by the end of April.For every mile completed, Neil is donating £ to Leeds Cares and hopes that friends and family will join in with the challenge at their own homes and donate after every mile completed.He said: “With no ultra-marathons to run I thought I’ll run one of my own. Any experience I’ve had with Leeds Hospitals in the past has been positive, I want to support all of our amazing NHS staff who are currently under huge pressure and working in extremely tough circumstances.“It is quite a few laps. All being well this takes me to a  mile ultra marathon distance. Yes it might get a little tedious but I am thinking of it as an ultra with a checkpoint, food and drink at every mile.“My young niece and nephew have already got involved and I’m hoping to get my own kids involved too. I’m sharing the challenge with my colleagues and running club team-mates so hopefully lots of us will get involved. Make it as interesting as you like. I am thinking about obstacles, singing, dancing, whatever. I would love itpeople joined in. The only rules are it has to be a minimum of one mile. It has to be fully within your own property boundary. If you don’t have a garden, special dispensation is given to use your street but remember the two metre rule.”All funds raised through Neil’s challenge will go towards Leeds Cares’ Support Your NHS Hospitals Appeal and provide vital support to frontline staff at Leeds Teaching Hospitals.This includes, paying for care packages, assistance with travel and accommodation where needed, as well as helping to fund other health and wellbeing initiatives to boost morale across the wards.

Since then, the number of volunteers has hit  although extra help remains welcome.Government guidelines mean the volunteers can leave their homes to help a vulnerable person and, with almost every volunteer already assigned to an inidual, more support is likely to be needed in the weeks ahead.The idea has been well received by those who live in the Stenhousemuir and Larbert areas and beyond, so much so organisers opted to branch out and ease the strain on mums and dads by collecting and distributing school lunches purchased by Larbert High School to youngsters stuck at home.Pupils from Larbert High and its cluster primaries are benefitting from the move.On just one day last month, volunteers delivered more than  meals to schoolchildren.Stenny chairman Iain McMenemy, who helped to organise the initiative, said: “We put out a few requests for further volunteers and the response to each has been really encouraging.“We’re doing one-to-one tasks for people like dog walking and shopping and we’re putting in calls to make sure they’re okay.“The advice was clear:you’re going out for your own shopping,you have to go to work,you’re going out for one bit of exercise oryou’re helping a vulnerable person you’re able to go out, particularly because some people have got nobody .“We have even had members of family from farther afield saying they have a relative in the area and they want to give you a call.“We’re still looking for volunteers as we’re only in week three and the smart money is probably on this being extended for three months. We’ve also expanded out to do school meal deliveries for a number of the schools. Carron Bathrooms got in touch and offered two vans so we now have three. On top of that, we’re doing deliveries for Falkirk Foodbank.”Though Stenny officials admitted concerns over the impact COVID- would have on the club itself, their focus has always been on the “health and well-being” of the community.When the community help initiative was first announced, Mr McMenemy wrote in a statement: “With the continuing spread of the coronavirus, Scottish football faces an uncertain future.“It is quite clear that there will be a signicant impact on football operations and finances and Stenhousemuir Football Club will no doubt be affected by this.“However, there are other, more important matters to think about. The coronavirus is a very serious disease that will affect thousands within our communities.“The health and well-being of friends, neighbours and members of our community should be our top priority.”CASE STUDYHARRY RAGLESSSTAR MAN: Steve in his dramatic outfit.A BOY with spina bida and his father are both doing their bit for the community # but in completely dferent ways.Harry Ragless usually spends  per cent of his time in a wheelchair due to his condition, which means his spine did not form properly in the womb and he has neurological damage to his legs and back and cannot feel his feet.But inspired by the efforts of -year-old war veteran Captain Tom Moore, which have seen him raise around £million for the NHS, Harry decided to raise money by walking with his frame and leg supports.The determined six-year-old from Oaksheath Gardens in Durrington, near Worthing, has raised £, and rising within days of his parents launching a fundraising page for his efforts # smashing his £ target.He said: “I feel really good. I was shocked.”His proud mother Selina Ragless said: “He has shocked us all. Because of his condition he tires easily but the other day he walked from our house to Vancouver Road, which is really far for him. We couldn’t believe it.”As word of his exploits spread, Selina said people were coming out of their homes to applaud Harry, who attends West Park School in Marlborough Road, Goring, when he went out for a walk.She said: “I feel overwhelmed to be honest. We owe the NHS so much they have been there for him since he was born and will be there for him for the rest of his le. If we can give something back, that is all we want.”In fact, Harry’s exploits grabbed the attention of Captain Tom himself # and his picture was featured on the Second World War veteran’s Instagram page.Harry is not the only person in his family who is raising a smile in the community.By day, his dad Steve is a warehouse manager # but during his daily walk, he dons his Stars Wars outfit to bring a bit of fun to the neighbourhood. The -year-old said: “I love it. From my own experience, I remember the first Comic-Con I went to in Birmingham and I saw all these stormtroopers standing outside, and I went into full fanboy mode.”The opportunity for him to get his own suit arose when a friend was selling theirs.He said: “When I finally put it on, I just felt amazing in it. I love seeing the looks and smiles, and people tooting their car horns and waving. It brings a few smiles in these very strange times.”Selina came up with the idea for him to wear it after they were put in lockdown, and during their walks around the estate Steve has posed for ‘socially-distant’ photos with some of the children who have come out to see him.In his spare time, Steve has donned the costume to a iety of events, including birthday parties, weddings and charity events.When the Connaught Cinema has done showings of Star Wars films, Steve has turned up in his gear to raise money for Sussex Association for Spina Bida and Hydrocephalus, a charity which has helped Harry.When askedthere was anything he wanted to say to the people who have donated so far to his campaign, Harry said: “Thank you.”To donate, visit justgiving. com fundraising selina-ragless.Nominate a community heroDo YOU know a volunteer who deserves to be recognised for making a change in their community The Prime Minister recognises one person a day with a Point of Light award.Read more or nominate someone at www.pointsoflight.gov.uk "},{"url":null,"title":"sad ending for ardfern","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPuffer enthusiast and reader David Wright, who grew up in Bellanoch and now lives in Largs, sent in this photograph of the #Ardfern# puffer taken in the early s.Ardfern sank entering the canal locks at Crinan.

illegally withholding refunds which should be paid to customers within  days.Instead, most customers have been offered vouchers or credit notes, with many complaining that they have been unable to claim a refund online, or get through to customer services on the phone to ask for their money back.Should I ask my bank for a refund Customers who have been refused a refund by travel firms and paid for their trip using a credit card can claim the money back from their provider under Section  of the Consumer Rights Act.Credit card providers are jointly liable with the retailer or trader for any breach of contract for misrepresentation, providing the value is more than pound and less than pound,.However, Which  has warned that some credit card customers have been told by their provider that theyre not eligible for a refund through the scheme.Others have been informed that their claim wonrsquot be processed until they have tried to claim the cash from the travel firm first, even though this is not a legal requirement.Customers are also able to claim through a process known as chargeback, which allows a transaction to be reversedyou are unable to resolve a dispute, including services not delivered.This covers all card payments and is a process agreed between financial institutions and the relevant card scheme, such as Mastercard and Visa.What are Mastercard and Visarsquos chargeback rights Mastercard said there is a chargeback right where firms have cancelled goods or services, even where this is due to government restrictions, insolvency or other exceptional circumstances.It is also validthe cardholder doesnrsquot wish to accept the firmrsquos offer to rebook or claim a voucher, but the issue should first be attempted to be resolved with the firm.Visarsquos guidance also states that firms should process a refund promptlycustomers decline a credit note or voucher, and cardholders do have a right to complain when goods or services are not provided.However, Visa does make an exception where firms have failed to provide a service due to a government-imposed travel ban, stating that this ldquosupersedes Visa rules on dispute rights.For this reason, Mastercard customers are likely to be more successful when making chargeback claims for coronavirus-related cancellations.If flights are cancelled due to closed borders, customers will still have a dispute right under both Mastercard and Visa, as EU-wide rules around refunds override the government travel ban, according to Which .Which banks will refund under Section  and chargeback Banks have said that they will assess each case inidually when it comes to refunds from firms only offering credit notes or rebooking a cancelled trip.This is what the major banks told Which  about issuing refunds:Where a provider has not met their legal obligations to the customer, Barclays will consider both chargeback and Section  claims, provided the relevant criteria are met.HSBC, including First Directand MS Bank, will allow a chargeback or Section  claim to be made for goods or services not received, but customers are encouraged to contact their airline first.Lloyds Group, including Halaxand Bank of Scotlandsay thata refund is not offered by the travel firm and a customer has proof of this, the bank can pursue a disputed transaction claim under scheme rules.Bankrsquos position is that every chargeback and dispute is dferent, and each claim will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis with the customer to work out the best solution.Nationwidealso says each case will be looked at on a case-by-case basis because it depends on the type of good services being purchased and what the terms of the agreement are with the merchant.Similarly, RBS, including Natwestand Ulster Bank, said cases would be considered on an inidual basis.If a claim made with the merchant in the first instance is not satisfactory, customers can contact Santanderto raise a claim.,params: .pushWhere the merchant has offered the chance to rebook for free and or provide vouchers and the customer is not satisfied with this then Starling Banksays it would initiate a chargeback.If a merchant is not offering a refund, or are asking customers to contact their card issuers to process a refund, Tesco Bankcustomers can raise a dispute.The Co-operative Banksays thatcustomers tried to resolve the issue with the merchant first but there was no refund or resolution, the bank would look at each case inidually to verya dispute chargeback right existed. If a chargeback right existed but the cardholder accepted a credit voucher, this would not affect the cardholderrsquos original dispute rights. The bank would also not reject a Section  claim outright in these circumstances.If customers are offered a voucher or a chance to rebook, TSBwould typically accept the claims and each case will be considered inidually.If the customer is unhappy with the solution offered by the merchant, Virgin Moneywould consider the terms and conditions. If the alternative arrangements are not covered, a chargeback would normally be successful. Section  claims will be considered on a case-by-case basis."},{"url":null,"title":"5g-mast-proposed-galashiels-council-land","story":"PLANS for a G mast in Galashiels have been lodged with Scottish Borders Council .The applicationwould see the .-metresteel pole placed on the verge of the townrsquos King Street, on land owned by the council.Residents are now able to submit their views on the proposal, put forward by Harlequin Group on behalf of EE Ltd.Galashielscouncillor Euan Jardine said: \"I believe it is important for our local economy that we are on level terms with other towns throughout the country in regards to G provision.\"It will also have some positive aspects for recreational usage and help to usher in advancements in technology that will change a lot of how we go about our daily lives.\"Mr Jardine added that he had not been approached by any residents about the application.Meanwhile, his ward colleagueHarry Scott told the Border he was not aware of the plans.Mr Scott said: \"I would need to study the application and the circumstances around it before coming to any conclusions.\"The application, ref   C, can be viewed on the council website."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-homes-can-book-virtual-visit-auctioneer-bonhams","story":"BORDERS residents have the chance to invite a world-famous auctioneer to look round their homes this week.Bonhams is delivering a free valuation service through video conferencing apps.And this week, households in the Borders are under the spotlight, with residents being asked to dig out paintings, jewellery, furniture and collectables.Bonhams Scotland managing director Charles Graham-Campbell said: \"Wersquore trying to adapt and do these valuations in a way thatrsquos safe for everybody.Appointments are available from Tuesday until Thursday , am to pm.Items that can be assessed include paintings, silver, jewellery, ceramics, glass, clocks, works of art, furniture, Asian items, and collectables such as whisky.Mr Graham-Campbell, , said: ldquoWersquove always provided valuations where people have sent in photographs but we havenrsquot actually done a Zoom, Teams or WhatsApp virtual meeting ndash a video going round a house looking at objects.ldquoSo this is something new, itrsquos the antique world adapting to the situation we currently find ourselves in.

The residential units are shown to be laid out in such a way that adheres to the normally accepted privacy and amenity criteria on overlooking and overshadowing, whilst affording the future occupants of the residential units an appropriate level of privacy and residential amenity.Access to the new development would come from Fall Avenue and James Kirk Way.A design and access statement included within the planning application notes meetings had taken place with ious local authority departments in a bid to address ious design requirements.It concludes: ldquoOverall, it is considered that the final design creates a well-considered, proportionate design that responds to the site constraints and the nearby area to create a positive design solution.ldquoThe result is a development that will make a positive contribution socially, economically and aesthetically to the area and enhance the amenity of existing and future residents within this area.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council stressed they ldquowelcomed comments from community councils.She said: ldquoIn this case, we consulted the community council back in December, and they submitted a response detailing a number of concerns.ldquoThese included concerns over house type and layout, increased vehicle movement and parking space provision.ldquoWhilst we understand that consultees may be frustrated when planning authorities do not always agree with their comments, we must balance these comments against the other material considerations of each case.ldquoIn the case of the Hallhill application, our conclusion was that, subject to the imposition of conditions, the proposed development was acceptable.Thank you for reading this story.

A report is expected by mid-May.Pub chain Wetherspoonrsquos has said it plans to reopen its bars and hotels in June and said that due to it having larger than average pubs social distancing measures could be applied.RetailMinisters are thought to be considering allowing some non-essential businesses to open, such as garden centres and car showrooms, provided social-distancing could be maintained.Lobby group the British Retail Consortium has produced guidelines on how stores could prepare for the easing of restrictions.The guidance draws on lessons learned from supermarkets in recent weeks to ensure the re-opening of non-essential firms can be done safely.Advice coverslimiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed.The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores.SportIt is understood Culture Secretary Olive Dowden has been working on a plan for major sports to be played behind closed doors when some social-distancing rules are eased.Weekly meetings are to be held between the Government, Public Health England and medical officials from sports bodies, with the issue due to be on the table when ministers review current measures next month.Key questions that need to be tackled include testing requirements, burdens on emergency services and the possible impact on fan behaviour ndash such as impromptu gatherings outside grounds.Sporting bodies are understood to be keen to resume full training safely as soon as possible.TravelLast week, low-cost European carrier Wizz Air announced plans to resume some flights from Luton Airport on May .Cabin crew will be required to wear masks and gloves on all flights and will distribute sanitising wipes for passengers, while new distancing measures will also be introduced during boarding.Mr Raab has indicated that officials are looking at possible checks at air and sea ports, with passengers arriving in the UK required to quarantine for  days.Meanwhile, the Rail, Maritime and Transportunion warned there was ldquozero chance of ramping up transport services soon, amid speculation of an increase on May  or May  when a new rail timetable is due.Last week, industry sources said no dates have yet been agreed or announced."},{"url":null,"title":"community-resilience-can-turn-help","story":"From collecting shopping and vital prescriptions to dog walking and simply being there for people, the volunteers are there for residents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Here, we look at five of the groups who are giving up their own time to help out.Cockenzie and Port SetonTHE resilience effort in Cockenzie and Port Seton has been helping launch a Fair Share hub at the Port Seton Centre this past week.The charity Fair Share delivers surplus food from supermarkets to the centre every Friday.The hub will cover the whole of East Lothian and support the centrersquos existing work to provide hot meals and food packs to families in need and children who would usually receive free school meals.Bryan Hickman, chairman of the local community council, which is leading the resilience effort, said: ldquoWe are still delivering food to those who need it but the Fair Share hub has been set up.ldquoWe receive food like coffee, cereal, milk and biscuits but this could change every week.ldquoItrsquos really good news that we have set this up as it will help us give other types of food.

Suddenly, people have realised why there are borders and what governments are there for: it is to look after their own. It is all about safety. When it comes down to it, other countries cannot make le and death decisions for you.It was the principle applied by Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand when she decided that, actually, globalisation sucks and its better to look after your own people, eventhis means closing the borders to foreigners. Yesterday she said the borders would not be reopened ldquofor a long time.It applies especially to small countries because they are generally forgotten when the chips are down. However, in Scotland, there has been a widespread belief that the reverse has been the case and that the pandemic has ldquotorpedoed Scottish nationalism as a Scotsman headline put it recently.Commentators insist that the United Kingdom has been reunited, as in wartime. ldquoThe British family has come together to look after each other, opined a romantic unionist in the New Statesman. Im not sure theres much evidence for this.The pandemic could equally be said to have demonstrated the opposite: that it is irresponsible in a crisis to remain tied to the United Kingdom, and to the politics of British Conservatism which this country has consistently rejected. Scots are certainly not enthused by Boris Johnsons record so far. Yet three quarters believe Nicola Sturgeon has done a good job, according to the latest opinion poll.Personally, I am extremely uncomfortable with all the talk of borders, but I cant ignore the argument that, had it been in control of them, a Scottish government could have attempted the elimination strategy so effectively deployed in New Zealand. Instead, the UK government kept the borders open and some , travellers a day continued to enter Scotland with scarcely any checks.Opinion: Teddy Jamieson: Government needs to deliver more than gesturesThe influential Devi Sridhar, professor of Global Health at Edinburgh University, believes thatScotland had implemented border controls early a policy of intensive testing might well have worked here. The Scottish death rate has been around half the UK figure, and Prof Sridhar thinks it could have been halted altogether. Yet, in line with the UK, the Scottish Government abandoned community testing and contact tracing in mid-March.Now, I dont subscribe to the view that Boris Johnson has allowed thousands to die in order to save his billionaire Brexit chums. The UK government behaved reasonably, according to its lights, muddling through as always. But many mistakes were made and there is certainly an argument that Scotland could have handled the crisis better on its own.There still seems to be an assumption in the UK media that big countries are better at handling crises like coronavirus than smaller ones. Precisely the reverse appears to be the case ndash the biggest countries like America, UK, Italy, have had a dismal record in managing the pandemic so far.It is not only remote antipodean nations like New Zealand that seem to have fared better. The country with the lowest number of deaths per million in the EU is Slovakia, which has a population similar to Scotlands. The wearing of masks was made compulsory there early in the infection.Slovenia, which borders on Italy, has also emerged largely unscathed. Most small states like Norway and Denmark seem to have managed the disease effectively. The outlier is Belgium which has had the worst headline death rate so far, partly because of its population density, and perhaps because the country which houses the European Commission has been the most open and ldquoborder-free.The true death rate league table, as the risk guru Sir David Spiegelhalter has pointed out, cannot be known until the pandemic is over. But there is pretty strong evidence that smaller countries do well. They seem able to move and adapt more quickly. They also tend to be more united and able to reach a rapid consensus.Of course, unionists have always insisted that, Covid aside, an independent Scotland would be too poor and dependent on UK subsidies to survive. It would certainly start le with a budget deficit. Butthe pandemic has shown anything it is that large deficits can be managed. Theyll have to be, because every country is now in the same boat.There was never any sound economic reason why Scotland should be any less able to manage its affairs than countries like Denmark or Norway. Nationalism is about security not economics.Anyway, in the bounce-back, assuming that it happens, Scotland will again find itself tied to policies that it doesnt choose, which may include another wave of Conservative austerity. The Westminster government will naturally look to London and the North of England, where its votes lie. They will be first in the queue for investment.This isnt out of malice, but simply because Scotland is another country. It seems blindingly obvious that we are entering an age in which voters and their governments are more nation-conscious than ever. Not in a spirit of xenophobic exceptionalism but out of practical necessity. They are nearer to the people and to their pain.Of course, independence is not coming tomorrow or the next day. There wont be a referendum in the near future, for obvious reasons. But after Covid, Scotland will continue to demand greater control over its own affairs. It will increasingly behave as an independent country, even though it is bound economically to the UK. If and when the next phase of Covid arrives, Scotland will not be following a policy dictated by Westminster.I think the voters are actually ahead of the politicians on this, and ahead perhaps of Nicola Sturgeon, who has been reluctant to appear to exploit this crisis for political ends. That is to be commended. There would always have to be cooperation between Scotland and England. But far from reviving the United Kingdom as a going concern, this pandemic could be the final nail in its coffin.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

He has started our encounter four goals down but he wonrsquot be defeated.This is Greenock Central, which was ranked top of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivationearlier this year. This table measures income, health, employment, education, housing, crime and access to services. It took the title from Ferguslie Park in Paisley which was named third most deprived this time. The statistics are well-intentioned and designed to inform all the concerned agencies about spending decisions and service priorities across , small postcode areas called \"data zones\". Yet, every four years when the latest winners and losers are revealed the names at the top and bottom remain largely the same.Mere statistics, though, can never form a complete picture of a neighbourhoodrsquos worth and needs. We all form pictures of what a community rated Scotlandrsquos most deprived ought to look like and this part of Greenock doesnrsquot really fit. Councillor McEleny says: ldquoWersquove got a high population of pensioners here, and many of them have been living in poor health for maybe the last  years or so of their lives.He points to a homeless centre standing between the town and the water. ldquoThis place lies at the heart of the data zone and contributes to the statistics. You donrsquot see places like this in Stockbridge or Bearsden. Yoursquove got people in there whose needs are numbered in multiple strands of deprivation. They get into patterns of behaviour at a very early age when they leave school and find there are no jobs. That place is a monument to the failure of society. You canrsquot just keep throwing pound after pound at fire-fighting. You have to have early intervention and prevention. In many of these cases though, the time for early intervention has probably come and gone.Councillor McEleny is a well-kent figure on these streets and our walk is punctuated by local people stopping to chat and say hello. Soon, we reach the glass-roofed shopping centre that sits at the heart of the town and the councillor becomes animated in his disdain for it. ldquoThis whole area was a handsome and open place with green spaces. As a child I walked through here on my way to the other side of town or down to the waterfront.ldquoSadly, the stock solution favoured by planners in places struggling with de-industrialisation and de-population was to get more retail spaces under one big roof. Itrsquos a  economy. Many of the units were quickly occupied by chain-stores and coffee-shop franchises which replaced local shops, unable to compete with their prices. Thus, money was sucked away from the town and into the pockets of distant shareholders.ldquoThis is why Irsquom passionate about politics: this is where support comes from. We have a budget of poundm in Inverclyde but people want their good roads and their leisure facilities. When they see you spending money on things that only seem to benefit a minority they get disgruntled. This is the test of a decent society: how much are we willing to help those on the bottom rung Alan Coyle is the principal teacher in Pastoral Support at St Matthewrsquos Academy in Greenock and observes the challenges encountered by his pupils and their little victories each day of his working le. He says. ldquoItrsquos easy to be negative and hark back to the old days of busy shipyards and full employment. I think itrsquos remarkable that the area of the town which has emerged as the most deprived is pretty much its commercial centre. This is testament, I think, to the way this area has been decimated due to poor governance.ldquoBut local people are very protective of it and proud of its heritage, but they are also very aware of the challenges it faces. However, you canrsquot discuss Greenock without placing it in the context of Inverclyde as a whole. When I taught Modern Studies we used to talk about the paradox of Drumchapel and Bearsden separated by only a few hundred metres. Here, we have an equally striking dichotomy between Kilmacolm and the east end of Greenock. The gap between the most and least affluent in Inverclyde is the same as it is in any number of towns across central Scotland.:Giovanna Eusebi shares memories of cooking with her grandmother in lockdown recipe seriesldquoOnce, we had the great industrial actions of the s and s and the Lee Jeans work-in.

But I dont think that feeling is there anymore.A DISTANCE of  miles separates Greenock from the stately arrondissement of Stockbridge, north of Edinburgh city centre, but it may as well be a dferent planet. This opulent little village was rated the least deprived corner of Scotland in the SIMD table, although it seems bizarre to include a word like lsquodeprivedrsquo anywhere near this neighbourhood.Those who donrsquot know Edinburgh are inclined to describe it as a posh city, but itrsquos not really. Refined: maybe reserved: perhaps, but Edinburgh too has its edgy places. Stockbridge though, is a Brigadoon version of Edinburgh that you happen upon after a long walk down from Princes Street, not noticing it until yoursquore actually in it. Here, the pace of le seems to slow and yoursquore invited to leave your baggage at the side of the Water of Leith. Itrsquos an enchanting place that beckons you to linger a little and chill for a while. Running alongside it is an aptly-named district called Comely Bank.In public buildings and dwelling places are the obvious dferences between affluence and penury but you sense these too in the way that people carry themselves. In poor streets there is a sense of people needing to be somewhere soon ever-alert for some invisible threat. In places like Stockbridge they move with the languor thatrsquos the preserve of those who measure their plans in years not days.Today, I encounter Stockbridge in the middle of coronavirus lockdown but you canrsquot help wonderingmuch has changed with the social restrictions. The usual middle class caprices of cobbled streets and the neighbourhood watch are here. Not for the first time I wonder why such genteel vigilantism is only seen in those communities that least require it.Where there are betting shops in Greenock here there are little shrines to interior design selling bespoke kitchens and luxury lights. Next door to a bakerycalled Pattiserie Florentin there is a shop which sells something called a ldquoSublime Replenishing Night Masque, which in Greenock might equate to a facial. Across the road stands an ample shop-front calls itself a lsquoFloatariumrsquo which I initially took to mean a shop specialising in inflatable paddling pools. On closer inspection though, there was a dizzying and esoteric assortment of treatments some of which, like manicures and pedicures Irsquod heard of and others such as a Lash Bar and the eponymous Floatarium that toyed with my imagination. You could go your holidays here.Judging by the number of charity shops here Stockbridge seems to have a big heart too. These though wouldnrsquot be called charity shops anywhere  but luxury goods emporiums. The estate agents advertise properties in the poundk to poundk price range in Greenock Central there are decent two-bedroom flats available for poundk. Just over there is a gallery called lsquoDoubtfirersquo. Only in a place such as this would such a name not be considered comically ironic. In the Water of Leith underneath the old bridge stands one of Anthony Gormleyrsquos sculptures. In the streets around it I counted eight interiors shops and five art-shops. They donrsquot just have delicatessens here they have epicures, which are not to be confused with the products on offer at the Floatarium.A lady with a Jane Austen accent calls to me across the road. ldquoItrsquos all very weird, she shouts, smiling. ldquoBut the wine-shop is open and Irsquove managed to get a chocolate brownie. These are essential items in a Stockbridge residentrsquos shopping basket.Maggie Lennon, director of the Bridges Programme charity and now resident of Glasgow, recalls her years living in Stockbridge fondly. ldquoThere was always something thrilling yet comforting walking down those steep hills from the new town to Stockbridge, she says. Itrsquos where, she says, the regimented streets and thoroughfares of the New Town succumbed to the anarchy of the twisted and meandering lanes of the village. ldquoI always considered Stockbridge to be hip.ldquoAnd I loved the restaurants, bistros, wholefoods and wine bars. Maison Hector was famous for the wall of running water cascading down the wall in the gentsrsquo loo. This was a design feature. We even had a cricket ground to which the Lord Taverners turned up once a year for a charity match and a ball. If you got tickets for this you knew you had made something of yourself.BACK IN GREENOCK they choose not to be resentful at such apparent inequality in the space of an hourrsquos drive in an affluent country. Councillor McEleny points to the townrsquos own handsome places. Just a few hundred metres separate the benighted town centre from the redeveloped waterfront seafront and the splendid Beacon Arts Centre. A tennis club, a private school and a fancy hotel sit just a few streets away from the corner that houses five betting shops. ldquoFrom a planning perspective, says Councillor McEleny, ldquoyou have to ask how we allowed a system that allowed the town centre to be hollowed out and then filled with franchises and chains and the practice of permitting the bookies to take up all the empty shop spaces.:Coronavirus in Scotland: Giovanna Eusebis lockdown family feast recipes for you to tryYet, he refuses to dwell on the glories of Greenockrsquos shipbuilding past and the well-paid jobs that made this place thrum with productivity and economic health. Instead he points to missed opportunities at a local level and a chronic lack of imagination and aversion to risk at a national level.ldquoWhen the shipyards began to close and the jobs began to disappear there was little thought given to what should happen next, he said. ldquoUnfortunately, Greenock encountered a perfect storm of circumstances all converging at the same time. Councils and governments were desperate for jobs and, in their panic, they invited the multinational supermarkets in with open arms.ldquoThe local producers all disappeared to be replaced by low-paid jobs contributing [less] to the long-term health of the local economy. Choices made nationally have also had an effect. Therersquos no thinking outside the box.ldquoCities have the tools to meet economic challenges. They will always attract finance and have a lucrative retail and night-time economy. The power of the public sector should have been better used in areas like this. Scotlandrsquos new Social Security hubs in Glasgow and Dundee are providing  jobs. Most of these are relatively high-paying, skilled jobs and would have made much more of a dference in Greenock than in Glasgow city centre.

Cities must accept thatwe want thriving towns which feed the cities then wersquove got to start doing things dferently or these communities and ones like Bute and the Western Isles are just going to keep depopulating.For those of us who live in and around cities itrsquos easy to forget that smaller and more far-flung places all need the same level of services: the bins still need to be picked up education and policing still has to be provided. But with fewer people yoursquove got less taxation to pay for it. The economic model is broken but it could be fixed with a little imagination.ldquoAny time a developer wants to build new houses therersquos supposed to be a mix to promote social cohesion.

Inverclyde now has the highest death rate in the country due to the disease according to the latest National Records of Scotland statistics.

This works out at around % of the total Scottish workforce losing their jobs.Their survey of more than  employers,  of them Scottish, also found the majority back calls to extend the programme and make it more flexible to allow short-term working. More than half of those asked wanted an extension until September.It comes after the Chancellor said the scheme would be scaled back from July, prompting concern from employers and opposition politicians that it could lead to the economy ldquofalling off a clf-edge.Lee Ann Panglea, Head of CIPD Scotland and Northern Ireland, said: ldquoThis survey very clearly shows the importance of the Governmentrsquos intervention, with over , redundancies prevented as a direct result of the Job Retention Scheme.ldquoThat being said, to prevent permanent redundancies the UK, the Government needs to look ahead and consider changes to the support it is providing to businesses. Our survey shows Scottish employers back both an extension to the Job Retention Scheme and increased flexibility to allow some short-time working, enabling organisations to bring back workers from furlough gradually while rebuilding their business.ldquoThis will become increasingly important as we look towards the next phase of this crisis, and will help avoid the current scheme simply becoming a waiting room for unemployment.Peter Cheese, head of the CIPD wrote to Mr Sunak three weeks ago warning thathe did not adapt the scheme, it could act as a ldquowaiting room for unemployment.Kate Forbes, Scottish Finance Secretary and Fiona Hyslop, Economy Secretary, wrote a joint letter to Mr Sunak today calling for assurances that Scottish firms would not be disadvantaged when the scheme ends.They said that while they welcome his assurances ldquo there will not be a clf edge to this support ending....we share the concerns raised about the uncertainty this brings.ldquoThe JRS is an essential leline for employers and employees, alongside the other schemes that have been put in place by both the UK Government and the Scottish Government. We understand that the support will need to be scaled back over time, but it is imperative that is done in a carefully considered way, and reflects the economic priorities of each of the four nations and the dferent sectors of our economies. The ability to stagger the closure of the scheme may be beneficial in considering how we safely exit the restrictions currently in place.Meanwhile the Scottish Conservatives said the survey was evidence that the Chancellorrsquos plan was a success.Jackson Carlaw, leader of the party, said: ldquoWe needed a major UK-wide response to this crisis to save our economy and protect jobs.ldquoThis survey shows the Chancellor delivered exactly that.ldquoWe all appreciate that this is a public health crisis, which has cost thousands of people their lives and left many more bereft.ldquoBut itrsquos also an economic emergency...Thankfully, the UK Government stepped in when workers needed it the most."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-sparks-calls-car-use-public-transport","story":"Busy roads in places such as Glasgow, Greenock and Fort William have all seen nitrogen dioxide levels more than halved.It comes amid calls for radical rethink of public transport and car use after the restrictions are lted.Plans to introduce low-emission zonesin four of Scotlandrsquos cities have been put on hold because of the outbreak.The new data was published by Edinburgh Universityrsquos Professor Paul Palmer and Dr Douglas Finch in a blog post for the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.They said: ldquoThis period of enforced traffic reduction has given us an opportunity to see what our cities would be like with reduced emissions. How air quality changes over Scotland and the rest of the world as the lockdown continues will be extremely interesting and no doubt the subject of many research projects.Combustion engines emit nitrogen dioxide , volatile organic compoundsand particulate matteramong other pollutants.All of these are known to have adverse effect on the respiratory system, including reduced immunity to lung infections, which the academics said ldquois particularly relevant to the Covid- virus.To track changes, they used air pollution measurements from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairsrsquo Automatic Urban and Rural Network .They said there are  sites operating in Scotland, scattered among urban and rural locations.The academics said: ldquoIf we look at a typical week of nitrogen dioxide concentrations in Glasgow, we can see the lockdown has led to a stark decrease in emissions.ldquoDuring a normal, pre-lockdown week, iations in nitrogen dioxide concentrations reflect traffic patterns, with a daily cycle peaking at morning rush hour and a smaller peak for the evening rush hour.ldquoThere are lower concentrations at the weekend due to less traffic on the roads.ldquoDuring the lockdown, there is still a morning rush hour but nitrogen dioxide levels are substantially lower for every day of the week, lower than values we normally expect on a Sunday.They said a similar pattern could be seen across cities in Scotland, as well as the rest of the UK.However, analysis of other pollutants paints a more complicated picture.The level of PM. , for example, has not shown ldquoa clear directional change ndash and even increased early in the lockdown.The academics said: ldquoOne potential explanation for this is the influence wind has on particulate matter. A new weather system arrived over the UK at the same time as the lockdown came into force and caused a change in wind direction over much of the country.ldquoThis meant air was being brought from the eastthat may have been more polluted than air blown in from the west.They said another explanation could be ldquoan increase in barbecues and garden bonfires occurring due to the warmer weather and people staying at home, although this is dficult to confirm.The experts said the analysis showed ldquotraffic is not the only consideration when cleaning up our air.They added: ldquoVariations in PM. concentrations have highlighted that changes in local emissions do not exclusively control local pollution levels.ldquoAs emissions from newer vehicle fleets get progressively cleaner we will likely need to sht our focus on to other pollutants. For instance particulate matter smaller than one millionth of a metre that can penetrate further into the human body.ldquoBy adopting cleaner travel options, such as more electrically powered transport and more cycling and walking infrastructure, then we would see lower levels of nitrogen dioxide.LEZs were due to have been brought in later this year in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee, while the first scheme in Glasgow was expected to be fully implemented, but Transport Secretary Michael Matheson has now said this is ldquono longer practicable.He stressed the Scottish Government is fully committed to tackling the problem of air pollution, but he confirmed the implementation of LEZs has been paused.It followed a decision by members of the Low Emission Zone Leadership Group, which includes Mr Matheson and Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham, as well as representatives of the four councils involved, Public Health Scotland and environmental watchdogs at the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.Ministers hope delaying the implementation of LEZs will give those involved the chance to consider what transport systems could look like after Covid-.Mr Matheson said: ldquoThe Scottish Government is fully committed to tackling air pollution in the quickest time possible.But he added the ldquounprecedented impact of the Covid- outbreak has resulted in necessary changes to priorities across government and across our local authority partners.The Transport Secretary continued: ldquoSimilar to other initiatives across public sector, we have come to the view that introducing low-emission zones across our four biggest cities by the end of  is no longer practicable.He said ministers and councils ldquoremain dedicated to introducing low-emission zones across Scotlandrsquos four biggest cities to improve air quality and protect public health.Environmental group Friends of the Earth Scotland said the Covid- crisis has ldquohighlighted our urgent need to reduce pollution.The grouprsquos air pollution campaigner Gavin Thomson said: ldquoTherersquos a strong evidence base on the links between air pollution and vulnerability to Covid-. Pollution from traffic causes and exacerbates many of the heart and lung conditions that put people at heightened risk from the virus.Joseph Carter, head of Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation Scotland, said he was ldquoshocked and disappointed, adding: ldquoRecent research has demonstrated a link between the levels of urban air pollution and the effects of Covid-, so it is vital now more than ever that we push ahead with LEZs to help protect our nationrsquos lung health."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11347005.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ve-day-75-memories-unite-lockdown-scotland","story":"Also at pm, thousands of people will stand up and raise a toast: ldquoTo those who gave so much, we thank you.It wasnrsquot supposed to be this way though.Camleys Cartoon: VE Day .There were supposed to be church services and public parades and street parties.

He kept a diary in which he recorded his experiences of VE Day and the joy he felt.ldquoI heard Prime Minister Churchill speaking on the wireless at pm, he wrote.ldquoHe announced the war with Germany was over. It was a day of great rejoicing. In Stoneyburn, bonfires were lit in every street and crowds gathered round them and sang into the wee sma hours.There were similar scenes all over Scotland. In Perth, the bells of the churches began to peel immediately after Churchillrsquos broadcast.In Falkirk, a pipe band paraded through the town. And in Greenock, there was singing and dancing in the streets.But the biggest party was in Glasgow. Crowds flowed in and out of George Square from pm until well after midnight. Many danced in front of the City Chambers.Fireworks were let off. Children and soldiers climbed on the statues. The pubs had to close early because there was no more beer left, but the party went on anyway.Reporting on the celebrations, The Glasgow Herald called it a robust and joyful night.ldquoNoise, the sort of gay, grappling, carefree merry making, the sound of which has not been heard of in Glasgow in the s, came back to town, said the report.ldquoYou could hear it half a mile away. It was solid and heartwarming.ldquoA party of able seamen took the notion to ride bareback on one of the equestrian statues in George Square. They contented themselves with hanging on to the stirrups when it was pointed out to them that their combined weight might topple horse and rider from the pedestal. Later they achieved their ambition and got astride the bronze horse.The Herald also reported how a Dutch sailor climbed on top of the statue that would later become famous as a resting place for traffic cones ndash the Duke of Wellington statue in Royal Exchange Square ndash and did an impersonation of Hitler.ldquoAn admiring crowd applauded his buffoonery, said The Herald.ldquoIt was equally responsive when he made a short speech in broken English and thanked ldquothe Scots for the brave part they had played in the liberation of his country.In London, the celebrations were on an even bigger scale. Some , people gathered at Buckingham Palace to see the first of several balcony appearances by the King and Queen and princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. Famously, the princesses later slipped out and mingled anonymously with the people.At pm, pretty much everything stopped for Churchillrsquos speech to the nation and it was a warning just as much as it was a celebration.ldquoWe may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing, he said, ldquobut let us not forget for a moment the toil and efforts that lie ahead. We must now devote all our strength and resources to the completion of our task, both at home and abroad.Historian Derek Patrick, who lectures in history at St Andrews University, says it is important to remember Churchillrsquos words and that in many ways VE Day represented a continuation rather than a change.ldquoRealistically, there was no sea change ndash nothing changed overnight, said Mr Patrick.ldquoYou would start to see POWs ing to the country but it took a long long time to get things back on an even keel and towards normality.ldquoThere was also a level of hostility and resentment ndash a feeling that people were promised a land fit for heroes but it was a  dawn. After years of war, there was perhaps a determination to see this project through and you can attribute a lot of the changes we saw after VE Day, like the NHS, to the war. This is a moment to rejoice ndash Europe has been pulled back from the precipice ndash but this is only one step on the road to victory.Catherine Drummond certainly remembers how tough it was after VE Day. She was a war widow with an eight-month-old daughter and had to work two jobs, in a shop and waiting tables, to make ends meet. She was also still mourning her husband.ldquoIt took me a long time to get over it, she said. ldquoI didnrsquot really give up hope until the POWs came home. I was hoping, you know.Like everyone , Mrs Drummond is now in lockdown, but Poppy Scotland is encouraging people to mark VE Day at home or use the subject as a resource for home schooling.You can also download bunting from Poppy Scotlandrsquos website for a Zoom party, or use their recipes to make some of the food, like potato shortbread, that would have been eaten at street parties  years ago.There are other events today you can take part in even in lockdown. At am there will be a two-minute silence, which will be broadcast on the BBC.At pm people will be encouraged to take part in the Nationrsquos Toast. Then, at pm, the Queen,  years after making her way incognito through the crowds in London, will address the nation.Mr Patrick said it was important to mark VE Day in this way, not just through any sense of celebrating the victory ndash although that is important ndash but also to remember what the country went through.The war had gone on for six years. Scotland had been subjected to  German air raids. Homes and families were destroyed. And widows and widowers were made. The country was exhausted and the political, social and economic repercussions would be felt for many years to come.But perhaps, says Mr Patrick, it is even more important to mark this anniversary than the ones that have gone before ndash for a simple and poignant reason. ldquoThe opportunities to speak to the people who were there, he says, ldquoare slipping away."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-countries-divided-lockdown","story":"In France, more than  mayors in the Paris region have urged President Emmanuel Macron to delay the reopening of schools on Monday.Many mayors around the country have already refused to reopen schools and many parents will keep their children at home even where they are ing again.The mayors called the timing ldquountenable and unrealistic, saying they were put on a ldquoforced march to get schools ready without enough staff or equipment, and complained that the government guidelines were too vague and slow in coming. But governments are also under pressure to reopen faster and kick-start economies that have been plunged into hibernation.Italian regional governors are pressing to open shops and restaurants, just days after the country began easing its two-month lockdown, allowing . million people toto work in offices and factories.Governors are seeking to be allowed to present their own plans for reopening, tailored to the rate of infection and economic needs of their regions.In Germany, whose  state governments are responsible for imposing and loosening lockdowns, some governors have been more impatient than others to open up businesses such as restaurants and hotels.At a meeting on Wednesday with Chancellor Angela Merkel, it was agreed that state leaders would have wide leeway to decide when to open more sectors of the economy.They also will have to reimpose restrictions locallycoronavirus infections rebound.In Russia, where the number of new infections is growing fast, President Vladimir Putin delegated the enforcement of lockdowns and other restrictions to regional governments, leading to wide iations across the country.Mikhail Vinogradov, head of the St Petersburg Politics think tank, told the Vedomosti newspaper that the Moscow government was sending mixed messages that governors find hard to decipher, wanting a victory over the virus while also encouraging easing of the lockdown.Fractures are also evident in the US, where about half of the  states are easing their shutdowns, to the alarm of public health officials.Many states have not put in place the robust testing and contact tracing that experts believe is necessary to detect and contain new outbreaks.And many governors have pressed ahead with reopening before their states have met one of the key benchmarks in the administrationrsquos guidelines for reopening - a -day downward trajectory in new infections.ldquoIf we relax these measures without having the proper public health safeguards in place, we can expect many more cases and, unfortunately, more deaths, said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy with the Kaiser Family Foundation in Washington.Researchers recently doubled their projection of deaths in the US to about , through early August. So far the US has recorded over , deaths and . million confirmed infections.Worldwide, the virus has infected more than . million people and killed over a quarter of a million, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally, which experts agree understates the dimensions of the pandemic because of limited testing, dferences in counting the dead and concealment by some governments.Europe and North America are looking nervously to Asian nations that are well on the way to reopening.China, where the virus emerged late last year, reported just two new cases yesterday both from overseas, and said the whole country now is at low risk of further infections after confirming no new deaths from Covid- in more than three weeks.China also fired back against claims by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that there is ldquoenormous evidence that the coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory. Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying accused Mr Pompeo of ldquomaking up lies and covering up a lie by fabricating more lies.Strict social distancing also appears to have vanquished the outbreak in New Zealand, where Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern outlined plans for further relaxing lockdown rules, with a decision coming perhaps next week.New Zealand would keep its borders shut, restrict gatherings to  people or fewer and hold professional sports events without spectators. Masks and other precautions would be required as restaurants and schools reopen, she said. But Ms Ardern called for vigilance.ldquoWe think of ourselves as halfway down Everest, Ms Ardern said. ldquoI think itrsquos clear that no one wants to hike back up that peak."},{"url":null,"title":"lord-armstrong-archetypal-insider-inspired-yes-minister-character","story":"Born. March , Died. April , Lord Armstrong, who has died aged , was the confidante and adviser to three prime ministers: all with very dferent characters but serving them all with respect and diligence.His tact, diplomacy and patience were, however, often required. He was much involved in many major public events ndash notably, the famous lsquoeconomical with the truthrsquo ndash in a court room in Australia in .A former embittered MI officer, Peter Wright, published his memoirs, Spycatcher, which the UK government alleged leaked confidential secrets.Wrightrsquos cunning defence lawyer, Malcolm Turnbullquizzed Armstrong ruthlessly and when asked the dference between a lie and a misleading impression Armstrong replied, ldquoperhaps being economical with the truth.He immediately pointed out that the phrase was not his ndash but that of the th century philosopher Edmund Burke. The off-hand remark was to haunt Armstrong all his le.In fact, he was known outside Whitehall as the original for the fast talking and manipulative Sir Humphrey Applebey in the BBC drama Yes Minister.Turnbull directly compared Armstrong to Appleby and chose to refer to Armstrong in his summing up, ldquoIf he is an honest man, then he appears rather like a well-educated mushroom. Later Armstrong described the experience as ldquothe most disagreeable time.Robert Temple Armstrong was the only son of Sir Thomas Armstrong a former principal of the Royal Academy of Music. He attended Eton where he was a Kingrsquos Scholar and then read Classics at Christ Church, Oxford. In  he was appointed private secretary to Reginald Maudling, the future chancellor of the exchequer and then served both RA Butler and Roy Jenkins when they were chancellors.Armstrongrsquos quick mind and eye for detail marked him out as a high-flyer in Whitehall. So, it was no surprise when he was appointed principal private secretary to the new prime minister, Edward Heath, in  . His distinguished career saw him at the centre of government serving Harold Wilson from  to  and, as cabinet secretary, to Margaret Thatcher from  and .It is thought he did not remain under Wilson as his secretary, Marcia Williams, wanted more control of the administration in Number . In  Armstrong worked for the reforming Home Secretary Roy Jenkins until . That year he became cabinet secretary and in  head of the civil service under Thatcher.Armstrong was the ultimate behind-the-scene-fixer. He played an important role in Thatcherrsquos bid for peace in Ireland. She entrusted Armstrong with the secret negotiations in which took place in the heated atmosphere of the time and after the hunger strikes. In Charles Moorersquos extensive biography of Thatcher, he calls those Anglo-Irish talks, ldquoArmstrongrsquos greatest legacy ndash that led eventually to the Good Friday Agreement in .Armstrong was involved in many of the high-profile events of the era: he was with Heath throughout the negotiations to enter the EEC in  he was taking the minutes when Michael Heseltine walked out of the Cabinet in high-dudgeon over the Westland affair. The Prime Minister then appointed Armstrong to conduct an inquiry into the sorry affair. Armstrong concluded that the Trade Minister Leon Brittan had leaked a letter damaging to Heseltine, without saying that Thatcher knew about the strategy.Signicantly, Armstrong was adamant that Thatcher should not give a knighthood to Jimmy Savile. His opinion prevailed until after he had retired.Throughout his years as head of the civil service Armstrong passionately believed in the need for total secrecy within Whitehall. Leaking was a complete anathema to him and he took a robust line against anyone who talked to the media. He issued firm guidelines instructing civil servants that they were, ldquoservants of the Crown. For all practical purposes the Crown in this context means, and is represented by, the government of the day.Armstrong was the archetypal Mandarin. Incisive, intelligent and able to weigh up important events and present them with succinct clarity. Under his management meetings were controlled and worked like clockwork. A minister who worked with him has written, ldquoRobert really was a remarkable public servant, one of the best I have dealt with. Firm, honest, tough, but much warmer than most of the others. Armstrong was always very proper in dealing with his prime Ministers. Despite seeing Thatcher two or three times a day he always addressed her as ldquoprime minister and she in turn called him ldquoRobert.Armstrong remained passionate about music all his le. He was secretary of the board of the Royal Opera House and then served on its board. He was a very knowledgeable opera fan and regularly attended performances. His friendship with Edward Heath was firmly founded on their mutual love of the piano: the two often played piano duets at Chequers of an evening with little or no conversation.On retiring Armstrong served in ious capacities and was knighted in  and made a le peer  years later.In  Armstrong married Patricia Carlow, and she survives him along with his two daughters, Jane and Teresa, from his first marriage, to Serena which was dissolved.Alasdair Steven"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-elon-musk-case-much-milk","story":"YESTERDAY we ran a story proving that the messages academics scrawl on walls can be just as smart as anything they write on a blackboard.

More than half of UK farmers have had their milk price cut due to the disruption.“It is good to see the dairy industry taking the initiative here but this does not let our governments off the hook. They need to do more#, the MP said,  #with restaurants closed and orders from vital export markets down, our dairy farmers need help to keep going.#They face challenges that cannot be papered over through programmes of worker support. You cannot furlough a dairy cow. The costs of feeding and milking continue regardless. In other sectors you can put production into hibernation until the markets re-open. You can#t do that for dairy products.#He continued: “The farming minister has just announced new funding to support dairy farmers in England due to the current crisis. I hope that all authorities will act where they can to mitigate the impact. There are roles here for the UK and Scottish Governments and for our local councils. They all need to step up to the plate.“Dairy farmers in Orkney worked hard to establish a brand recognised as being a high-quality product.  If we do not support them during these challenging times then we risk that work being wasted.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Could we get the website sorted so that people get the information that they need, rather than thinking that in order to get a test they have to first get a plane or a ferry ”Responding, the Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock MP, said: “It’s a very important question and I’ll look into the specics of it to make sure that our island communities get the appropriate response in the website. He’ll appreciate that we put the testing website together at a remarkable pace and so in the first iteration weren’t able to make this sort of important nuance for Orkney and island communities, but I’ll take that away and look at it.“He mentioned the answer to this in substance and the answer is to get the home testing kits working for Orkney [and Shetland] and I’m sure there’s a way through.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said:“I am glad that action will be taken to get this issue sorted. If key workers in the isles are not getting the testing that they need because they are getting inaccurate advice from official websites, that puts more people at risk and harms public confidence.“Island communities could benefit greatly from more access to home testing kits for key workers. There were positive words from the Health Secretary on getting these working for the isles.  This doesn#t need to be complicated.  It just needs to be fixed.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It was announced yesterday that the Scottish Government would pass this funding along in full to Scottish councils.Council leaders appealed to the Scottish Government through COSLA, which represents local authorities in Scotland, to give the funding directly to Scottish councils immediately to help them provide essential services at a time when costs are increasing signicantly and income has dropped substantially due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.Speaking following yesterday#s announcement, councillor Stockan said: “The announcement from the Scottish Government has shown the value in council leaders working on a common cause together at a time of crisis to press the Scottish Government to give us the support we so badly need and deserve. The government’s eventual decision to bow to our pressure and pass this money on is a signicant victory for local government.“Much more support is needed for local services from the Scottish Government though. There is more funding that should be available to us and we will continue to fight for that. Local councils are facing unprecedented dficulties.

While guidance to local councils suggested the former, a recent response from the Tourism Secretary, Fergus Ewing to Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart suggested the latter.Mr McArthur wrote to finance secretary, Kate Forbes, seeking clarity and has been told that  days of bookings are required in order to be able to access support. But Orkney’s MSP has pointed to claims by the Association of Scotland’s Self-Caterersthat requiring  days of bookings unfairly excludes most self-caterers who operate in areas where the tourism season is typically shorter, such as rural and island communities.Mr McArthur said: “Getting the eligibility criteria right for these funding schemes was never going to be easy. The Finance Secretary deserves credit, however, for being willing to make changes based on feedback from myself and MSP colleagues, as well as businesses directly.“However, almost two months into the lockdown, and it is clear that many self-catering businesses in Orkney are still falling through the gaps, despite being able to evidence self-catering as a primary source of income.  This not only threatens the future of these inidual businesses but also potentially Orkney’s wider tourism sector.“The situation has not been helped by contradictions in the advice offered by dferent Ministers. The Finance Secretary has now addressed this confusion over eligibility criteria, but at the same time confirmed the sense that the bar has been set very high for applicants in many rural and island areas.“As the ASSC point out, expecting self-caterers in the islands to be able to evidence almost five months of bookings for their property is often unrealistic given that the tourism season is typically shorter here than in other parts of the country.“I have urged the Finance Secretary to look again at the criteria to ensure that they are properly ‘island proofed’ under the terms of the Islands Act.  While there is a need to avoid making scheme rules overly-complex or confusing, it is also important that they achieve fairness for businesses wherever they happen to be based.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Billions of pounds worth of gas from Shetland#s Laggan-Tormore Shetland Gas Plant complex pass through Shetland for consumption, where. It is a monstrous scandal that not a single molecule of that is made available to Shetland homes and businesses.Responsibility lies firmly at the door of the SIC. In the interest of their renewable energy hobby horse, for years, they have done nothing to secure incredibly cheap gas supplies for local people and left no stone unturned in their lobbying for Viking Energy. Of course, cheap gas for power generation, homes and businesses would kill the chances of UK consumers paying £. billion for a subsea transmission link to transport unreliable, expensive renewable energy the + miles to SE England, where demand is located.And the result  The devastation of the Unesco Shetland Global Geopark, lauded for its hitherto pristine environment.I#m a stakeholder # and I welcome the opportunity to be consulted. However I have no idea how I can add my contribution. Ryan can you help me out here and publish the link in the Shetland Times mailto:NTIMailbox@ofgem.gov.ukIt is not unreliablestored. This technology exists. If we simply used the electricity to generate hydrogen, and store it just like the old city gas, we can run all our power needs through hydrogen fuel cells. Simple, cheap and clean. Or we could let global heating destroy our children#s future because nobody wants to see a big windmill near their property. I#m old enough not to care.To give a hand to each.#To leave the oyster-bed.#The sun#s shining here and like the old oyster, I can#t be bothered, either, John. Have a nice evening, do.Love it, thanks JT 🙂No real need for fuel cells. Hydrogen was % of coal gas, can be stored in gasometers and burnt in gas fires and used to power piston engines, gas turbines and most conventional heating systems. A hell of a lot cleaner than burning wood chip. Now forget the windfarms, obsolete technology, use tidal generation and mini modular nuclear.That way we will have a living planet worth saving, not a mass of concrete, steel and fibreglass.I#m not sure windfarms are quite obsolete yet# with the technology that is available at scale onshore wind is the cheapest source of new electricity. Perhaps not on peat bogs though. That#s not to say we can#t do better with other renewables.PS circa Dads Army, I am not that old!!!At  dollars a barrel so called renewables will need to reduce costs by a huge margin to compete with oil. At the current oil price of less that  dollars a barrel wind, tidal and solar no hope.Renewable energy is not produced in barrels. Where did you hear that We continue to burn oil and gas because the infrastructure is there and the investment has been made. But when it comes to investing in new electricity generation, onshore wind is the cheapest. Also # I am not sure how such a low price is beneficial to the oil industry what with their high fixed costs As a patriotic Brit I am all for us standing on our own two feet and generating cheap and reliable energy. Shetland aside, as a nation we are net importers of oil and gas. Why rely on the likes of Russia or our Middle Eastern friends when we can spend that money at home and have jobs for Brits producing clean and plentul energy  Let#s stop living in the s. Let#s have clean, reliable British energy instead.I tend to lean in the direction indicated by John Thomas.For reasons of cheapness , safety and reliability I can’t see why wind and tidal forces should not be the primary options for energy generation. Winds are unlikely to stop blowing and sea tides are unlikely to dry up , so how can they not be major considerations Nuclear power is also in the running provided that the associated risks can be accepted. No matter what the no doubt wellintended may suggest, there ARE risks which do not raise their ugly heads with wind and water. Reliable , sustainable , and non polluting. What more could one ask for in this struggling , changed 🌎 world we occupy for a short time. Now Thorium nuclear is clean, no long half-le isotopes produced and no danger of meltdown.They are also neither cheap or reliable. Back up will also be requiredfor when the sun doesn#t shine or the wind isn#t suitable at more expense. More renewables will inevitably contribute to increased fuel poverty.Michael Moore # Planet of the Humans # a documentaryon the renewable energy scam that the left want banned # who would have thought !The more you look into the problem of energy supply against saving the environment, the more contradictory conclusion one gains. Wind and Solar maybe cleaner, but how much land and natural habitat being destroyedwould be required to power a city of several million##.and this is just  city     What energy source would be required alsothere are days of no sun or no wind. What backup technology would be in place, and would this also be clean energy  It seems ironically disturbing that cleaner energy through wind and solar, would also have a negative impact on the environmentyou take into consideration the polluting processes involved in the manufacturing of such devices.as well as the huge amount of land required , which would also be expanding as the population grows. I would assess cleaner energy via wind and solar would have a larger impact on the natural eco-systems and the environment and would still be reliant on fossil fuels. As far as I can see, disturbing as it may be, the only source for future energy demand is to go nuclear.And no , I am not a pessimistI’m a wary realist.Better than a blinkered optimist.Nuclear Energy does have its dangerous pitfalls, but we are already using this technology to generate electricity. I believe % of our electricity is produced by nuclear power  In France I believe this to be much higher  Although it may be dficult to assess the impact of solar or wind generators on the environment on a large scale, it would have to be balanced between the use of such technology to this of the environmental and eco-systems which maybe affected.I do not know how much land would be required to provide electricity to a city of several million, but I would hazard a guess it would be quite considerable  This use would also have to compete with farming and agriculture not to mention living space for housing etc etc.  from the shore would these wind turbines be  I suspect it would be quite close  Will our seashores be lined up with thousands of wind turbines I would also suspect the cost of such a scenario would be very high in adoption and maintenance.lol Hayden. Disturbing as it may be, I do not think we will have much option but to go nuclear. If it were a case of saving the environment and eco-systems, one may not have any choice We are already using this technology to produce electricity, andit is the case of minimizing our impact on the environment and eco-systems, then nuclear maybe the only way Cleaner energy may be, morally, more suited, but one must also take into consideration the impact on the environment and eco-systems and how this may change towards a negative once we realize the full influence of this compared to the potential benefits I cannot give any answers to what a large scale wind or solar scheme would be to power several millions homes, but I would suspect it would be considerably large in land area  One could use the same land for agriculture and farming and possibly housing  Shetland is suited for wind generating power schemes, but what would be the benefits to this of tourism, bird populations and property values, not to mention the visual impact of those people living near to such schemes and the consistent vibrating noise.Agriculture, farming and housing would not be adversely affected. Bird populations would be safe and tourists would be able to concentrate on spending their money which, after all, is the main reason for encouraging them to visit Shetland!! By the way,I have stood close to wind fed generators of the type we are discussing and never felt vibrations —- just the pleasant swishing sound of the rotating blades. Not too dferent from the soothing sounds of the sea.Haydn, You live in Crickhowell, Wales, nowhere near any large windfarms.The Black Mountains and the Brecon Beacons on your doorstep. Just how close is your home to the #the pleasant swishing sound of the rotating blades  .# I really doubtyou can even see a -meter turbine from your home. On Shetland people would be living under them, they would be about  meters high on high hills  meters or so plus above our heads!!! The plan is for over.Another smaller series of wind turbines is even closer to me and they are sited near Ebbw Vale on The Tops as we in the lower valley area call them. From close first hand experience I still maintain that the swishing sound of the blades is pleasant and certainly not as fierce and noisyas anyof the many gale force winds on Shetland.Or does that apply just to those who are incomers from other places like England for example Where do you hale from Ian  Just wondering !Llanfoist is just a walk from Crickhowell, I walk that distance most days!!! !! As you asked, for what it is worth, I have lived in Shetland  years now, longer than anywhere . Just the relevance of that is a bit beyond me but it seems you wish to know!!Ian, since I don’t live in Crug Hywel , a walk from where I do liveand back would be  miles. In my marathon running days that would have been a decent evening run but those days have gone. A short walk of  miles would be easier now.Ian, you did a Trump special and answered a query I did not make. I did not ask you how long you’ve lived on Shetland. My question was where do you hail from Haydn, I wrote rotor noise, not Chinook engine noise. Do not put words in my mouth. Now close up in a gale the continuous noise compares to engine noise fo a jet engine, I believe Chinooks are turbojet-powered. Now your  Ferndale turbines are tiny compared to the Shetland proposed -meter monsters. Less than half the rotor spread and about one-twentieth the number, not  miles away but on top of us..Isn#t it the case that so-called #infrasound#, noise at frequencies too low to be heard by humans, is what reportedly causes stress and illness in humans and other animals  The sort of thing they use in movies to create feelings of unease, etc. You can often feel it but not hear it.Personally, it is not the sound noise that particularly concerns me but the complete destruction of a unique landscape and rare ecosystem. The peat hills of Shetland are as rare special as the Amazon rain forest. Hectare for hectare the peat stores more carbon than a rainforest, tens of thousands of tons of concrete a hundred miles or so of new roads all over the high hill! Then several dozen hectares of quarrying and thousands of tons of broken rock all taken from a very unique landscape. The breeding ground of the very rarest of birds, animals and SSSIs desecrated all to make a very few people richer. Seven hundred and fty-odd million Pounds on copper and plastic cable alone.

Anything  just risks a spike in cases again.”But Tory MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston insisted the UK government was making decisions “rooted” in a “science-led approach”.“It is entirely understandable that many people are becoming increasingly frustrated being asked to observe lockdown,” he said.Jamie Halcro Johnston“But it has saved lives and no one in Shetland needs reminding of the impact Covid- has had in the islands.“It is therefore crucial that the steps we take as we come out of lockdown are based on robust science, have the confidence of the public and are clear and easy to understand.“That’s why it is reassuring that the UK government has taken, and continues to take, the best scientic evidence available, and their proposals for test, track and trace is rooted in this science-led approach.”He challenged the Scottish government to improve testing capacity and ensure Scotland “doesn’t miss out from being part of the NHS mobile app which could be so important in identying those with exposure to Covid- and reducing the spread of the virus”.“Equally important is that, as restrictions are lted, everyone understands what is required of them in their daily lives. This really is a case of a common approach and a common message saving lives.“Those who promote a dferentiated approach ignore the practical implications of that.#We must avoid mixing messages and any ergence in practice across the UK must be based on clear need, and not on doing things dferently for the sake of it.” raquoHow about getting our councillors back to work so that they can start getting to grips with developing an economic recovery plan to try and mitigate the effects of the impact of a government mandated shutdown.The four pillars of our economy are crumbling..

However, in May  Loch Alsh became a centre of activity for processing German U-boats that had surrendered at the end of the war in Europe.With the objective of ensuring total German naval disarmament, the Royal Navy intended that, at the cessation of hostilities, any German U-boats that surrendered in and around Europe would be moved to the UK prior to their destruction.To this end Admiral Sir Max Horton, Commander-in-Chief Western Approaches, advised the Admiralty that he intended to use Lisahally in Northern Ireland and Loch Ryan in south-west Scotland for laying-up the surrendered U-boats pending joint Allied agreement about their future.’, and on  March  decisions were concentrating on three main strands of action.The first related to the surrender orders to be issued to the U-boats at sea at the time of the expected German capitulation.The second concerned the reception arrangements for the U-boats surrendering from sea, and the third concerned the arrangements for the reception of the U-boats that had surrendered in German and German-controlledports and which were then to be transferred to the UK.Loch Eriboll near Cape Wrath in the far north-west corner of Scotland was designated as a ‘Port for Preliminary Examination’, Loch Alsh on the north-west coast of Scotland, was designated as a ‘Port for Final Examination’ and Lisahally and Loch Ryan were designated as ‘Ports for Laying-Up’.Loch Alsh was selected for the final examinations because it was sheltered, because it could accommodate  U-boats on buoys at any one time, and because it possessed both a resident naval organisation and a railhead.As Loch Ryan did not become operational until after  June, all the U-boats handled in Loch Alsh in May  were destined to be transferred to Lisahally.Loch Alsh’s principal role was to remove the U-boats’ torpedoes, as well as to take the majority of the German crews into captivity, and this was influenced by the fact that it was already a formal, but small naval anchorage.However, although it had a resident Naval Officer-in-Charge, Captain Brian Gourley, who was to be responsible for the overall organisation, it did not have sufficient staff or facilities to process the number of U-boats that were expected to pass through in transit from Loch Eriboll to Lisahally., which was commanded by Commander Bertram W Taylor, was ordered to Loch Alsh to organise this intermediate part of the surrender process,arriving there on  May.In the meantime the general German capitulation came into effect, and this led to the issue of the Admiralty order that all U-boats were to surrender with effect from  hours on  May, and that those still at sea were to head for a number of designated reception ports, the prime one of which was Loch Eriboll.The first U-boat to arrive in Loch Eriboll was U- on the morning of  May and, by  May seventeen more U-boats had arrived in the Loch.None of the U-boats which had surrendered from sea spent long at Loch Eriboll.Instead, after the preliminary examinations, they were moved quickly, and under escort, to Loch Alsh. Escort Groupwhich was based in Loch Eriboll:, which were being moved to Trondheim from Narvik where they had surrendered on  May.Escort Group , but instead of being allowed to continue to Trondheim, the Admiralty directed that the U-boats should be escorted to Loch Eriboll.The  U-boats were therefore escorted across the North Sea to Loch Eriboll by the th EG, and they all arrived off Loch Eriboll at  in the evening of  May where they were met by ships of  EG before moving into the anchorage for initial processing.After that, the ex-Narvik U-boats were quickly transferred to Loch Alsh, sailing in three separate batches of five:, and they were escorted from Loch Eriboll by four ships from  EG on  May. left Loch Eriboll on  May escorted by two ships from  EG and one from the th EG. escorted by three ships from  EG also left Loch Eriboll on  May.It had originally been intended to berth the U-boats singly alongside Loch Alsh’s railway pier where, with the aid of its steam crane, their torpedoes would be disembarked.However, it soon became clear that the rate of arrival of the U-boats from Loch Eriboll, the lack of on-shore accommodation at Loch Alsh and the general shortage of personnel, would result in a very slow turnoverthis plan continued.moored in Loch Alsh awaiting disposal by the Royal Navy.However, these two ships were well suited to the U-boat handling task in every way, particularly as each possessed an electric crane whose lting capabilities were ideal for the task of disembarking torpedoes from the U-boats...The four remaining ships in  EG were employed in providing guards for the U-boats on arrival and for escorting them to Lisahally after they had been processed. arrived from Loch Eriboll, and the final examination process began.This started with the removal of all the German officers and men from each U-boat, except for a steaming party.A Royal Navy submarine inspection party which had been delivered to Loch Alsh on  May then began the formal inspection of each U-boat and, as soon as the torpedo compartments were pronounced clear, the removal of the torpedoes started.Within the first  hours, eight U-boats had been cleared,  torpedoes had been removed, and  German officers and  ratings had been searched and landed as Prisoners-of-War.would be available to be transferred to Lisahally on  May.The prospect of up to eight U-boats being transferred to Lisahally so quickly after the German capitulation provided an ideal opportunity for Admiral Sir Max Horton to stage a public multi-national surrender ceremony to celebrate the successful end of the anti-U-boat war in the North Atlantic.’ which took place on  May.Despite the considerable pressures created by the need for speed, Commander Taylor’s arrangements for the processing of the U-boats at Loch Alsh turned out to be exactlyright in the circumstances, and after clearing the first eight U-boats, the process settled down to run smoothly.Prisoners were cleared every other day, so that there were never more than  men in either depot ship at one time.The later U-boats had few torpedoes, many none at all, so the rate of handling went up to six per day at times. had arrived at Loch Alsh from Loch Eriboll on  May, and aroused considerable interest because of its cargo of strategic materials from the Far East, and it was then sailed for Liverpool on  May.The U-boat arrived in Liverpool on  May for its cargo to be unloaded in the Gladstone Dock. was moved to Barrow-in-Furness on  May for completion of the unloading process.In the meantime, while in Liverpool, the U-boat was inspected by Admiral Horton amid considerable publicity, giving rise to the oft-repeated, but incorrect, story that it had surrendered there.The movement of the remaining U-boats from Loch Alsh to Lisahally went equally smoothly, with the U-boats and their escorts departing regularly:.As warheads were also stored in the lighter, steps had to be taken to keep the fire localised and prevent the heat reaching the explosives.A drter remained alongside all night, prepared to tow the lighter clearnecessary, but the fire was contained and the drama ceased.The fire had occurred in the battery compartment and propelling motor of the torpedo, and was the result of chemical action after acid from the batteries was spilt whist the torpedo was being handled. bound for Lisahally.

And while the Executive at Stormont holds firm about no changes to the current lockdown, you soon get a sense that a gradual release has left the starting blocks a little earlier than the authorities might have liked.It is a bright, sunny early afternoon, and even before you reach the town there are signs that lockdown may be wearing thin. Some people are unpacking a picnic at a table in a lay-by.Hidden away behind Lough Neagh, you will find the people who inhabit rural Mid Ulster often feel they are forgotten about away from the bright lights of Belfast.And examining the statistics around Covid-, you will find the rates of the virus are a lot lower than where.Social distancing is being well observed.Outside the several chemists along the main street queues have formed. People stand two metres apart. Several are wearing masks. Entrance is on a one-in, one-out basis.One thing you do notice is that most of those around the town are older.There are no young families, few teenagers. Most shops remain closed. There is no reason for them to be there, so they are not.Yet Cookstown is billed as the retail capital of Mid Ulster.In a small area you will find Tesco, Asda and an MS Foodhall. Homebase and Halfords are open.Throw into the mix BM Bargains and Poundland and that magnet draws them all to one central location.As more shops have come out of their enforced hibernation, so too have the people.At the snf of a nibble to feed their starved retail need, many are biting.In one convenience store there is an admittance that the number of people out and about is on the rise.There#s definitely been an increasing number of people coming in, I am told.And what we#re seeing is more and more older people, possibly coming back two or three times a day.There are very few younger people and teenagers.Cookstown is a hub for a wide area of townlands dotted around the Sperrins and along the shores of Lough Neagh where people do not have access to chemists and supermarkets.They all gravitate to the main town.And while the younger generation content themselves by staying in touch through social media, that is not the way the older generation do things.The scope for loneliness is much wider in the rural community, but perhaps that environment gives a sense that the population is shielded by the wide open spaces around them.And this is a town without a bypass.Everyone travelling through Mid Ulster has to go along the . miles of the main street. There is no alternative in a quirk of geography and infrastructure.While that might explain the amount of traffic, the sense remains that the community is making a slow and gradual choice to ease back to le as they knew it.On the other side of town, two miles along the road to Omagh, a police car is stationed at the gates of Drum Manor Forest Park - a reminder to everyone that the current advice on non-essential travel still stands.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

While it is true that many unionists - including those in the Assembly - have reservations about how Boris Johnson has handled the crisis, they remain cautious about pursuing any strategy which would see Northern Ireland signicantly out-of-kilter with the rest of the United Kingdom.And Sinn Fein - very keen to play the England#s problem is Ireland#s opportunity card at the moment - doesn#t want Executive strategy to be signicantly out-of-kilter with the rest of Ireland.Issuing joint statements about working together in the Executive is one thing but actually working together, particularlyit#s in a way that seems to favour one national government approach over the other, is another thing entirely.In a letter on April , following Leo Varadkar#s announcement that the Irish Government would begin a unilateral process to ease lockdown restrictions, Mary Lou McDonald wrote: You announced last night that the caretaker government is preparing a plan to lt the public health emergency restrictions, with steps to progress this plan taken every two to three weeks ... A safe exit strategy must be, by definition, all-Ireland. This will require close collaboration and co-ordination with the Executive in Belfast.This all-Ireland mantra has been at the heart of Sinn Fein#s approach to Covid- since the beginning, with many of their key players linking it to the much bigger constitutional project of Irish unity.Understandably, that approach has angered most of unionism, including many inidual unionists who aren#t, in fact, supportive of the UK Government#s sluggish approach to the crisis, or the reality that there have been more Covid- deaths in the UK than in any other European country.There was also anger when Sinn Fein junior minister Declan Kearney wrote in his blog a few weeks ago: Disturbingly, the extension of lockdown in the short term masks an argument which is being encouraged by some right-wing elements in the British Cabinet and also by some unionists in the north of Ireland that the lockdown measures should be relaxed and that economic activity and productivity should be resumed. It is the typical capitalist reflex which puts the market economy first.The problem for Sinn Fein is that Leo Varadkar has now pushed ahead with his own proposals to relax lockdown and encourage the resumption of economic activity and productivity, and has done so without consulting either Sinn Fein or the Northern Ireland Executive Yet, Regina Doherty, the Irish Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, seemed to defend not formally telling the Executive first: At the end of the day, I think the most important thing that we needed to do was to tell the people that we serve the Irish people. And that is what the Taoiseach did at the first opportunity after the cabinet meeting was over.Yet, even though Sinn Fein has expressed anger at Varadkar#s not consulting the Executive and Doherty#s defence of him, the party still feels obliged to support him, rather than any UK-led alternative.There had been hope in some quarters that the nature of the crisis would improve the relationship between the DUP and Sinn Fein. But evidence suggests that the constitutional gulf between them remains as wide and as isive as ever.And while it is true that the number of deaths here is lower than originally predicted , there has been no corresponding indication of cross-party agreement on what needs to be done next. Ironically, the success in keeping the numbers down seems to have exacerbated the policy strategy disagreements between them.Sinn Fein has been pushing for the Executive to publish a plan for easing restrictions, but that seems to be more to do with keeping Northern Ireland in step with the Irish government rather than waiting to hear what Boris Johnson will say on Sunday.Michelle O#Neill wanted the plan published yesterday, but with the UK Government favouring a UK-wide strategy built on conversations with the devolved administrations, I#d be very surprisedthe Executive agreed to jump the gun and publish its own proposals.From the unionist perspective, it#s also a matter of not creating new gulfs with the UK Government, particularly at a time when the Executive and Northern Ireland will need massive economic support from that government for the next few years.That#s not to say that the Executive couldn#t, or won#t, produce a recommendations document which might feed into Johnson#s thinking before Sunday#s speech.The Scottish Governmenthas already made a case for some bespoke arrangements while the nature of the relationship between Northern Ireland and the Republic also favours a bespoke approach in some, very specic, areas.But since the Irish Government has clearly embarked on its own approach to easing lockdown and kick-starting the economy, it would now seem oddthe Northern Ireland Executive decided not to wait for a lead from the UK Government. Indeed, Johnson may already be considering the Varadkar proposals as a potential template.It#s also worth bearing in mind that nobody really knows how the easing of restrictions in some countrieswill work.An awful lot seems to depend on people exercising common sense, avoiding complacency and adhering to social distancing rules and continuing lockdown regulations. There is no guarantee that will happen.And nor is there a guarantee that there won#t be a second wave of Covid-, which could actually be much more devastating than the first wave. For all of us, this is - and will remain - uncharted waters.Northern Ireland is in a very odd position: torn politically constitutionally between London and Dublin and with both the DUP and Sinn Feinseemingly electorally obliged to support competing strategies from Johnson and Varadkar, even when they have dficulties with those strategies.But, as I have noted many, many times down the years, and in relation to a whole host of issues, the dreary steeples outlook will always trump a genuinely collective approach.And even though the Covid- crisis is a unique challenge we have, as ever, ended up in our default position.Am I surprised  Not really. The border continues to eclipse and predominate every other consideration - even a unique crisis of this magnitude - and I don#t see that changing anytime soon.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She spent several months in hospital with a broken hip and wrist and contracted MRSA while when was in there, but we#re all delighted to still have her with us as she reaches  years.Contracting coronavirus was a big concern for us, but thankfully, though she tested positive, her symptoms turned out to be quite mild. Throughout it she was determined to stay in her home. She wasn#t for going to hospital and wanted to be where she felt safe and secure. The care the staff at Bradley Manor gave her helped her stay where she wanted to be. We just can#t thank them enough for all that they have done these past few weeks. Coronavirus still knocked her back a good bit and, given her age, the recovery is slow, but we all take it in turns to FaceTime her every day. She might not be up to date with technology, but the staff in Bradley Manor have been fantastic in helping her. She loves nothing more than seeing her great-grandchildren. All the family have been there for her in whatever way we can.None of us have actually seen her since the home closed to visitors in the middle of March. While we did have plans to celebrate her birthday at Belfast Castle and let her look down over the city she loves so much, we#ve obviously had to put any big family gatherings on hold until the situation changes.But we have been in touch with Bradley Manor and we#re all hoping to be there in the car park next week to see her on her birthday.Though she#s in bed most of the time recovering, the staff are hoping to get her down to reception and wheel her to the door so she can see all of us.Birthday cards can be sent to Ethel, addressed Bradley Manor,  Crumlin Road, BT GEBelfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Unite deputy regional secretary Davy Thompson said: “It is not enough for the minister to recommend the public wear face masks on buses and trains – we need to see them made compulsory. Our drivers’ lives and those of fellow travellers are at stake – we need every possible protection.It is absolutely essential that we get a common approach in both jurisdictions. Davy Thompson, Unite.“We are also concerned thatthere is a dferent approach taken north and south drivers and inspectors on cross-border services could be placed in the invidious position of having to police dferent infection control regimes as the vehicle crosses the frontier. It is absolutely essential that we get a common approach in both jurisdictions on this island.“Facemasks alone are not enough to protect passengers and our members – we need to see social-distancing secured through additional funding of public transport services, Mr Thompson concluded.Nichola Mallon said, as the evidence on face coverings was not conclusive, passengers won’t be turned awaythey are not wearing face masks.She also warned that wearing face coverings should not lead to a  sense of security and that social distancing will still be required on public transport.right thing to do to keep people safe but it does have implications, not only for the financial viability of our services but also the capacity.

The safety of passengers and staff on our public transport network is my priority and with that in mind, I have approved a number of service adjustments.”Ms Mallon said it was also important to cooperate with Irish services on cross-border travel.“Each of us as an inidual also has a part to play, she said.If you can work from home, you should continue to do so. If you must travel, try to plan your journey outside busier periods and for shorter journeys walk or cycleyou can.

Nichola MallonTranslink staff that engage with the public will now be wearing face masks or shields, where it is appropriate.“It is important we recognise that it is only as a result of the efforts and selflessness of all Translink workers that our public transport services continue to run to allow our health and social care and other key workers to access their workplace and services,” the minister said.“I am determined to do all I can to support and protect them and have asked Translink to ensure that all of the necessary procedures and personal protection equipment continue to be in place to ensure the safety of staff.“I would once again ask everyone to continue to stay at home to save lives and ensure that they travel only when it is essential to do so.

At the weekend, the Irish government outlined its roadmap for reopening society and business. The British government is set to publish its plans this Sunday. Speaking at today’s COVID- press conference First Minister Arlene Foster said the NI Executive is working ‘actively’ on its plan and continues to make progress. She said people would be ‘anxious’ to know of NI’s plan but cautioned that social distancing measures are ‘likely to be with us for some time’. The First Minister explained: “In fashioning a plan ministers are being guided by the latest medical and scientic evidence. googletag.cmd.push “We are looking closely at the current rate of infection, the estimated level of transmission, and estimates of future trajectory in this pandemic once relaxation takes place. “Another signicant factor in our planning is assessing the impact on our health and social care system to deal with COVID- cases. “And also of course the resumption of other health services. The Executive is also assessing the wider health, societal and economic implications of the current restrictions to determine which areas will pose the least risk and greatest benefitwe were to relax them. “None of these decisions are easy, as we’ve said before all governments are grappling with the implications of a public health crisis that we never thought would come to pass. googletag.cmd.push “And COVID- has dramatically altered society and will have implications for the way we live for many years to come.” She added that there is a danger of the public becoming distracted and going back to what they did before. The First Minister said the country needs to be on guard and respect social distancing guidelines. She went on to say that people ‘cannot afford to be lax’ and act like coronavirus has been beaten as it still ‘poses a threat to you and those you love’. Restrictions won’t be kept in place any longer than is necessary, she concluded. Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said any approach must be ‘cautious and gradual’ as COVID- is still spreading and taking lives. She asked the public not to take matters into their own hands. The plan will be published as soon as possible, ‘hopefully later this week’. Any plan is ‘not a green light’ for people to do as they choose as the Executive is looking at the safest possible approach, the Deputy First Minister added. She also took the opportunity to welcome Finance Minister Conor Murphys announcement of over pound million of new funding for infrastructure, regeneration, and tourism projects across the north. That includes match funding of poundm forDerry City and Strabanes City Deal Inclusive Future Fund.

Cllr Kathleen McGurk started the GoFundMe campaign to help those struggling to afford day-to-day essentials, with over pound raised to date. The Causeway Coast and Glens councillor said the generosity from the community had been ‘overwhelming’. “Many in our community will have lost their income, seen businesses collapse and are facing increased living costs from being at home all day,” she said. “Families and others in our community will be struggling to put food on the table and pay their bills. I have been overwhelmed by the generosity from our community to help those in need. googletag.cmd.push “Despite the extensive measures put in place by Communities Minister, Deirdre Hargey, these are unprecedented times and there will still be many people who require help.” The funds will help people to purchase essentials such as groceries, sanitary items, electricity top ups and coal. Referrals to the scheme can be made to any of the Community Co-ordinators who are involved in the Community Coronavirus Response. The scheme provides support to those who are isolating at home and has tapped into strong community spirit in the area. Cllr McGurk also reiterated the call from the Executive for local residents to stay in their homes and adhere to the guidelines. googletag.cmd.push She said: “It is imperative that everyone continues to observe the social distancing and lockdown guidance issued by the Executive. “Monday saw the highest COVID- death toll here in the North since the beginning of the Pandemic, and we cannot become complacent. “I understand that it is an extraordinary ask of people to stay at home, particularlyyou are struggling financially and this is why I believe all elected representatives should work as hard as possible to alleviate the stress and strain of the lockdown. “I hope that the money I have helped to raise will be able to help some of my constituents with this.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Paddy Simpson, of Fortuna Enterprises Ltd, owns Brunswick Moviebowl in Pennyburn Industrial Estate as well as two hotels in Belfast. With the British government’s poundbn job-retention scheme running until the end of June, Mr Simpson has said financial support must be ‘tapered’ as businesses begin to reopen at reduced capacity so they can afford to pay staff. Under the scheme - known as furloughing - the government covers % of the wages of workers who are staying at home during the coronavirus pandemic and not working at all, up to a cap of pound, a month. googletag.cmd.push The Moviebowl houses a cinema, restaurant bar, bowling alley, cafeacute and children’s adventure playpark amongst other attractions. Mr Simpson employs around  staff -  in Derry - who have been furloughed during the crisis. At the weekend, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced the Irish government’s roadmap to reopen society and business. The NI Executive is expected to outline its own pathway out of lockdown in the coming days. Once businesses reopen it will be on the basis of reduced capacity and strictly adhering to social distancing guidelines. In line with that guidance, staff will alsoto work in fewer numbers. Staff and customer safety is a matter of utmost importance, Mr Simpson said. googletag.cmd.push When the coronavirus first emerged bars in Derry led the way by announcing closures on March , including The Blackbird, Paedar O’Donnell’s and the Gweedore. The following day Brunswick Moviebowl decided to close its doors while encouraging its employees to use the time wisely to look after the most vulnerable during the pandemic. Brave decisions made by local businesses at that time have been widely praised and are believed to have saved lives. It was not until a full week later, March , that the British government officially ordered businesses to close under law. Mr Simpson said that with all the uncertainty at the time it was a ‘tough’ decision to make but he knew it was the right one. “It was tough, but people were ahead of the government because they just weren’t coming out at that stage. “That Sundaywe were empty. I think we did  lunches that Sunday and we’d normally do about . “It feels like a year ago already,” he said. Initially, the company had to pay staff but the announcement of a furlough scheme came as a relief. “We didn’t know how long it was going to go on. The big worry was how we were going to pay staff, everybody has bills. “But in fairness the furloughing scheme has been brilliant, that can’t be denied. And that took a lot of the pressure off.” ROADMAP The Irish government’s roadmap for reopening society and business sets out five phases with the first beginning on May  and the last on August . The Irish government’s plan states that cafeacutes and restaurants providing on-premises food and beverages can re-open at phase , June . They must comply with social distancing and strict cleaning protocols. Indoor recreational venues are set to reopen on August , where numbers can be limited, cleaning can be maintained, and social distancing can be complied with. The final phase is the one that is most applicable to Mr Simpson and Brunswick Moviebowl as that is when pubs, bowling alleys and cinemas can reopen in the south. Mr Simpson has welcomed the Irish government proposals saying ‘it looks fair enough’ and shows ‘light at the end of the tunnel’. “The biggest worry will be how theyend the furlough. If they suddenly say you can open on the th of August and everybody is off furloughed: with social distancing and other measures you’ll not be fit to bring back all the staff at the one time.” The Irish Government described its plan as a ‘phased flexible roadmap’ and said it has a ‘clear way of deciding’ when it can move from one phase of reopening to the next’ with a focus on minimising the number of people who get the infection, and the number of deaths as a result. In terms of that timeline, Mr Simpson said it will be a ‘numbers game’ and it will depend on how the numbers look at the time. “I think it could end up moving either way, backwards or forward,” he added. FURLOUGH There are concerns amongst restauranteurs that reopening with half the number of customers would not be profitable. Askedthat was a concern for the Moviebowl andhe envisages opening dferent parts of the building at dferent times, Mr Simpson said: “No, I think we would manage that.” He expects that once permitted to do so, the facility will open in its entirety with the exception of the Bananas Adventure Park as it would be impossible to ensure social distancing amongst young children. Mr Simpson is hopeful that the NI Executive will lay out its own roadmap soon as ‘everybody needs a bit of guidance’. “The biggest worry is looking after your staff and customers, and furloughing can’t just stop on a particular date because businesses won’t open up with the same number of staff until things go back to normal. “The furlough scheme needs to be tapered in some way so that it carries on. “We have  staff in Derry and you’re probably going to be opening with  or . And over the weeks and months you’d be taking them back gradually.” He concluded: “The Moviebowl will start out with reduced capacity and we’ll have to see how it goes from there.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Chloe Tinneyhas now set her sights on the real thing with plans to climb an ‘actual mountain’ in future. She managed the epic feat in  days to raise funds for her ‘heroes’ at Foyle Search  Rescue. Mount Everest is earths highest mountain above sea level. With the help of a few calculations Chloe worked out that she had to climb , stairs, , flights of her stairs, at a rate of  flights a day for  days. googletag.cmd.push The -year-old devoted herself to the task by iding her time wisely between her full-time job and conquering the stairs. Her ascent got underway on April  and it has been gruelling climb ever since. She has been hampered by a niggling repetitive strain injury to her knee along the way which was attributed to the left turn in the stairs. This meant she had to use a crutch for the vast majority of the challenge and cut out the turn to avoid aggravating the injury further. An astounding pound, raised so far for Foyle Search  Rescue more than six times her original target. googletag.cmd.push Speaking after reaching the summit yesterday, she said: “My leg injury has been feeling slightly better so I have been able to do the last  days without use of my crutch which is making it so much easier. “I also think my body has adapted to having to walk up stairs for  -  hours a day, every day because I am finding it easier every day. “That being said, I cant say it is something I will keep up,” she joked. “I cant wait to be done and have a little rest, maybe eat a pizza and have a glass of wine to celebrate being done with stairs. “Maybe Ill climb an actual mountain when this is all over  “I am genuinely so taken back and actually quite emotional about the generosity of everyone towards me during this time. From donating money to the amazing FSR, sharing posts, offering encouraging words, and so much more. Thank you just isnt enough. “I know the donation to FSR will mean so much to so many people and will definitely be put to amazing use to help all the folks at FSR continue to be heroes in our city.” Donations will remain open for another three days,you would support her cause visit:https:www.crowdfunder chloe-climbs-mount-everest-from-her-home  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was recently announced that the Department for Communitiesfood box scheme was capped with an overall delivery capacity of , boxes per week across Northern Ireland and will be time bound. In terms of delivery to the Derry City  Strabane District Councilarea, full capacity has been reached and there can be no increase beyond the , of food boxes received. Currently, it is estimated that there is an existing demand of , Food Boxes which is  in excess of the current allocation and consequently a reserve list has been formed. googletag.cmd.push People Before Profit Cllr Shaun Harkin commented: I and many others arealarmed to be notied that the Department for Communities has capped the weekly free food parcel scheme for those shielding and in financial hardship across the North. We are calling for this decision to be reversed immediately. In Derry and Strabane , people have been accepted to receive a food parcel but the number has been articially capped here at ,.  people havebeen placedona reserve list with no guarantee they will receive food help. Its also been announced no further referrals will be accepted even though many people are not aware the scheme exists. This is discrimination and a breakdown in the departments duty of care for those in need. googletag.cmd.push Since the Executives decision to implement Tory welfare reforms our already high levels of deprivation have rocketed across the North. The clearest example of this was the rising dependence by many iniduals, familiesand workers on food banks. The Covid- crisis isputting many more people into financial hardship. Now is not the time to cut off access to the food program - funding should be increased based on need not on an articial figure thatunderestimates food poverty. The Covid- crisis has already forced many more people to apply for meagre welfare benefits. And many more people will be forced to applytheir jobs dont . With more people unemployed and dependent on benefits food poverty will increase further across the North. The Stormont Executive has the responsibility to make sure this is addressed. Political establishment parties are already talking about the need for austerity and hard choices - working people and the vulnerable should not be forced to bear the financial burden of this crisis. On April  the Department for Communities Covid  said its FoodParcelService has been hugely successful in getting immediatefoodand essential supplies to those most in need, with , boxes having been delivered to the  Council distribution centres in the three weeks since the service started. This service is part of the emergency response for those who are in critical need offoodand have no other means of accessing it, either through deliveries, or help from family and friends. A Department for Communities spokesperson said: “The delivery offoodparcelsto those in need was developed as one of the key strands of the Departments emergency response to the current crisis situation. The service has been a major success with a large number of boxes being delivered to those in need via partnership working between Councils and our grass roots Community Organisations. When theschemeopened it was envisaged that approximately ,foodparcelswould be needed, but due to the current situation the Department has delivered thousands more.” “Our current suppliers have now informed us that it not possible at present to go beyond a supply capacity ceiling of ,foodboxes per week. This is due to the sourcing offood, the capacity of suppliers to pack, prepare and distribute at volume – and additional limitations such as the need for social distancing requirements. We will continue to deliver to the thousands already receiving theparcelsand the Minister will be holding urgent meetings with officials to explore all available options.  “This service is one element of our overallfoodsupport programme, aimed at those who are in most critical need. People can also use the helpline to be connected to other means of support, including volunteers who can collect shopping, or community groups andfoodbanks who can provide support. For those people who still require access to such help contact the COVID Community Helpline on    in the first instance.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Michael McMullan tells the story of the Park mans soccer career... *** The weekends were always about football for Gerry McElhinney. Right from the beginning. And as much as he could possibly squeeze in. Gaelic football or soccer, it didnt matter. In January , in his mid-teens, he set off from the family home under the slopes of Sawel mountain. He walked a mile down the Barnes Road. Boots and gear at the ready, hed rest against the wall of the bridge in Park. googletag.cmd.push It was the start of a regular occurrence, waiting on the recently-formed Dungiven Celtic to collect him for the first game of a soccer career that would take him to Celtic, a career in England and the cusp of the  European Championships. “I used to walk down from Dreen, because you would never have found it, it was a little farm,” McElhinney begins. His GAA career would earn him an all-star at the age of  in his first season with Derry seniors in . In  of a family, six boys and five girls, football was always the game of choice in the fields around home, with the neighbours joining in to bolster the numbers. googletag.cmd.push From the rural Moneyhaughan Primary School, he moved on to St Patricks and St Brigids in the nearby village of Claudy. Hughie Doherty was on the teaching staff and passed on his fascination with sport. The schools gym was a haven for youngsters after school. Basketball, Gaelic football or soccer. It didnt matter. Indeed, it was often after six oclock before McElhinney ed home. “Hughie was the guy who got me to Dungiven Celtic. I was  at the time and I played in goals for them,” said McElhinney. Derry City had withdrawn from the Irish league and before they became affiliated with the League of Ireland in the s, they operated in the realms of junior football. It wasnt long before McElhinney joined them. He recalls how hard it was to get around at the time during The Troubles, but he always found time for sport. “I wouldve played football seven days a week,” he said. After an outing for Derry City in the morning, Saturday afternoon would revolve around Dungiven Celtic and before he had played for Banagher on Sunday, McElhinney wouldve fitted in a game with Dungivens Sunday morning league team. He was the oldest in the house and it wasnt he until was  that the family home had electricity. The first game he saw televised was the  FA Cup replay. David Webbs injury time winner for Cha over Leeds and a Cha kit received as a present swayed him towards supporting the blues. Performances at the heart of Derry Citys defence brought him to the attention of the other club he supported – Glasgow Celtic. *** Jock Steins right-hand man in the Celtic dug-out was Sligo man Sean Fallon, who scouted players such as Kenny Dalglish and goalkeeper Packie Bonner, Steins last signing as Parkhead boss. “When I played with Derry City, there were some Celtic scouts watching. They were a brilliant club...Sean was assistant manager, but he knew all about Donegal, he had scouts all around there,” McElhinney recalls. They liked what they saw and their  year-old target was invited for trial and was snapped up on a semi-professional arrangement. McElhinney would fit it in around work and was given time off to spend the summer in Glasgow. He played on and off for a season with the clubs reserves. While he was trying keep trim for the boxing back home under Jim Noonans eye in Draperstown, Stein insisted their new signing needed to put on weight. McElhinney was stuck in the middle. “I stayed in a hotel, near Hampden Park, and I used to travel into training every morning. My diet, every other night, was four pints of Guinness in the hotel,” McElhinney joked, having put on a stone and a half. “By the time I came back from Celtic to play for Derry I had went welterweight to middleweight. Arthurhad something to answer, it was very good protein.” Gerry didnt force himself into the first-team at Parkhead, but rubbed shoulders with many future Hoops legends in the reserves side- names like Bobby Lennox, Peter Latchford and George McCluskey. During nearly two hours on the phone, his level of detail is staggering. He never forgets a name. From the Derry players he played with, the soccer battles he had and right down to those he worked for during his summers in America. “A lot of the time, especially in the bad weather, the Celtic first-teamers would playto keep themselves fit,” he continued. At the time, Billy McNeill had left the club. Roddy McDonald was on the books and they brought in Roy Aitken, who would go on to captain the club and win the league and cup double in . McElhinney was surplus to requirements, but his career was far from finished. It was time to head back home, but his career was only beginning. *** Gerry hit the brakes, but nothing happened. The car skidded on the black ice, careered across the road and over the hedge. “Therell be no Castle the night Jim,” Gerry offered, when the car eventually came to a stop. He was referring to the infamous Dungiven night spot and the Jim was Jim McGroarty. McElhinney was dropping him off in Lettershandoney on their way back from a Finn Harps game. “I had to go and get towed out,” McElhinney remembers. “My da was going mad because it was his car and I was in the bad books for a while.” He was on loan from Parkhead to the Harps. He had one game under his belt in centre midfield against Shamrock Rovers, before regular goalkeeper Gerry Murray got injured. In their hour of need, they turned to McElhinney. “I had played in goals for Dungiven and Patsy McGowankicked a few balls at me under lights in a car park in Ballybofey and reckoned I would be a good goalkeeper.” He was never going to stay in goals. Goalkeeper Packie Bonner used the rough and tumble of the Donegal club GAA scene to toughened him. Coming for crosses was a breeze. McElhinney was dferent. Heplayed a dozen games between the posts for the Harps, but wasnt for him. Boredom set in. He missed the banter of being stuck in the middle of a game. “We did alright, we beat Bohemians on a night when I got man of the match and we had some good times,” he said of this time at the club. This spell came during Gerrys GAA career with Derry and during the summer hed jet off to America for work and play a bit of ball. During his time in Philadelphia, he played with FC Berne and he had trials with Chicago Sting. But as  came to a conclusion, so too did his time in the US. *** When Annie McElhinney answered the phone and a thick Scottish accent filtered down the line, the first thought was that Celtic were back in the hunt for her sons signature. It wasnt, but it was an opportunity to kick-start a soccer career that had been parked. It was the voice of Distillery manager Gibby McKenzie. On hisfrom America, Gerry had written to a few clubs askinghe could get a trial. Distillery were the only club to take notice. “Right big man,you want to come and play for us, you can come and play for us,” McKenzie bellowed down the phone. At the time, they had no ground and shared with Brantwood in Antrim. McElhinney got Kenny Shiels and Eugene Young involved in the club. “At that stage, Distillery pretty much finished bottom of the league every season,” Gerry recalls. “Martin ONeill had gone by the time I got there. I played there for a season and done really well.” McKenzie was replaced as boss by Bertie Neill as manager. He arranged for McElhinney to have a trial with English top-flight club Bristol City, who had Joe Royle on their team. “I played against Vancouver Whitecaps, it was a friendly. We drew - and I thought I did fairly well,” Gerry adds. Manager Alan Dicks was impressed by what he saw, but with the clubs financial situation and so many of the squad on long-term contracts. His hands were tied. “I was that down in the dumps, so I decided to go back to America. I came back again at Christmas and went back to Distillery,” he continues. With a good pre-season under his belt, he was playing well and impressed a Bolton Wanderers scout during a friendly away to Drogheda in July . Within a week, McElhinney and Neill were on a plane over to Bolton.  Gerry in his Bolton kit “I played a friendly against Bury FC. It was - and I done quite well and they more or less signed me straight after the game. “Bolton bought me for a fee that rose to around pound, after I had played a certain amount of games and lined out with Northern Ireland. Distillery moved to their new stadium in Lisburn, got the greyhound track and built that big wall. They reckon my transfer paid for that wall. They were really good to me.” *** Anytime Northern Ireland Billy Bingham came to see Billy Hamilton play for Burnley against Bolton his heart mustve been in his mouth. Gerry McElhinney didnt stand on ceremony. He gave as good as he got. During his first two seasons at Bolton, the international call never came despite being on the standby list for the squad in the build-up to the  World Cup in Spain. “I broke my toe. It had came through my boot and I was injured and wouldve never been fit,” McElhinney admits. Later in his Bolton career, after ing from a -game spell at Rochdale, he forced himself into the first-team and his form earned him an international call-up, with the  European Championships around the corner. Seven games came and went, with McElhinney yet to make an appearance. Their last game was against West Germany, who they had beaten - in Belfast thanks to Ian Stewarts goal earlier in the campaign. With Hamburgs Volksparkstadion filling to an attendance of over ,, Billy Bingham decided to reshuffle his deck and took his Derry contingent to three. Martin ONeill was joined by Paul Ramsay for his second appearance and dropped Chris Nicholl at the expense of Gerry McElhinney for his debut at the age of . Gerry remembers Bingham giving him the news: “Youre playing big man, get yourself sorted out,” he was told. “I didnt think that much about it at the time, it was just a game. You have to understand that I wouldve travelled anywhere for a game of football,” McElhinney said. Just to spice it up, he was up against captain Karl-Heinz Rummenigge who had six goals to his name during the campaign, but the Park mans early tackle laid down a marker. After  minutes, Northern Ireland grew in confidence much to the frustration of the home fans. Early in the second half, Harald Schumacher failed to hold an Ian Stewart effort and when Ramsays shot was blocked, Norman Whiteside fired them into a - lead. McElhinney was part of the back four that thwarted the Germans and on the one occasion they threatened to beat goalkeeper Pat Jennings, Jimmy Nicholl cleared the ball off the line from Lothar Matthaus shot. For four days, Northern Ireland led West Germany by three points in the one qualying spot. “They had a game in hand against Albania to qualy and a win would put them through on score dference,” McElhinney can remember. Their chances were not out of their own hands. The Albanians took an early lead, only for Rummenigge to immediately level the game and with  minutes to go, Gerhard Stracks goal ended their qualication dreams. “After that, I played for Northern Ireland in the Home Championships and we were the last winners of it in ,” McElhinney adds. In the first game, they were - winners over a Scotland side that included Roy Aitken. McElhinney nearly score a third and after the game the Scots manager Jock Stein admitted to McElhinney that he shouldve kept him on at Celtic. *** By Christmas of , Bolton were in the third tier of the league and their bank accounts didnt make for pleasant reading. Aside from a squad of kids, McElhinney and Jeff Chander were the only senior players they could sell to help their plight. “He went to Derby County and I went Plymouth. Bolton got a combined total of pound, and it kept them afloat. Even though they had been relegated from the first ision, they were still getting really good crowds. “They lost a lot of players, with them not being given contracts. Nothing has changed with Bolton, they still have got no money.” During his four years at Plymouth, McElhinney was captain for two seasons as they gained promotion to the old second ision. In his first season,  , he helped tighten up their defence, helping them begin their climb – beginning with a - win over Bolton early in his spell. The following year, Argyle were promoted in second place. ”We beat Bristol City in a mid-week game to seal promotion. Reading won it, we were second and Derby County came third,” McElhinney remembers. His Gaelic career was beginning to take prominence back home and after steering Gortin to the final of the Tyrone senior championship – a game be missed due to Boltons pre-season – he transferred back to Craigbane. “A lot of the guys who sign for Plymouth never leave that area. It is a lovely and Cornwall is on your doorstep,” explains McElhinney, who had the opportunity of following his promotion winning manager to picturesque Torquay. “I was coming home, every now and then, playing Gaelic football on the sly. To come home and play, I had to drive from Plymouth to London to get a flight home. I thought Id move a bit closer, so I moved to Peterborough.” When Peterborough gained promotion in the  season, Gerry was the youth team coach before moving to non-league Corby Town for two seasons at the end of his career. Gerry now lives in Draycott, near Derby where he currently works in construction. He is still fanatical about sport. He is also a guest at Bolton on match-days days and takes part in an open mic question and answer session. “Plymouth get me down too, I am part of the Plymouth Argyle legends and I got my free tie,” he laughs. Gerry McElhinney – a legend on both sides of the pond.

Michael McMullan tells the story of the Park mans soccer career... *** The weekends were always about football for Gerry McElhinney. Right from the beginning. And as much as he could possibly squeeze in. Gaelic football or soccer, it didnt matter. In January , in his mid-teens, he set off from the family home under the slopes of Sawel mountain. He walked a mile down the Barnes Road. Boots and gear at the ready, hed rest against the wall of the bridge in Park. googletag.cmd.push It was the start of a regular occurrence, waiting on the recently-formed Dungiven Celtic to collect him for the first game of a soccer career that would take him to Celtic, a career in England and the cusp of the  European Championships. “I used to walk down from Dreen, because you would never have found it, it was a little farm,” McElhinney begins. His GAA career would earn him an all-star at the age of  in his first season with Derry seniors in . In  of a family, six boys and five girls, football was always the game of choice in the fields around home, with the neighbours joining in to bolster the numbers. googletag.cmd.push From the rural Moneyhaughan Primary School, he moved on to St Patricks and St Brigids in the nearby village of Claudy. Hughie Doherty was on the teaching staff and passed on his fascination with sport. The schools gym was a haven for youngsters after school. Basketball, Gaelic football or soccer. It didnt matter. Indeed, it was often after six oclock before McElhinney ed home. “Hughie was the guy who got me to Dungiven Celtic. I was  at the time and I played in goals for them,” said McElhinney. Derry City had withdrawn from the Irish league and before they became affiliated with the League of Ireland in the s, they operated in the realms of junior football. It wasnt long before McElhinney joined them. He recalls how hard it was to get around at the time during The Troubles, but he always found time for sport. “I wouldve played football seven days a week,” he said. After an outing for Derry City in the morning, Saturday afternoon would revolve around Dungiven Celtic and before he had played for Banagher on Sunday, McElhinney wouldve fitted in a game with Dungivens Sunday morning league team. He was the oldest in the house and it wasnt he until was  that the family home had electricity. The first game he saw televised was the  FA Cup replay. David Webbs injury time winner for Cha over Leeds and a Cha kit received as a present swayed him towards supporting the blues. Performances at the heart of Derry Citys defence brought him to the attention of the other club he supported – Glasgow Celtic. *** Jock Steins right-hand man in the Celtic dug-out was Sligo man Sean Fallon, who scouted players such as Kenny Dalglish and goalkeeper Packie Bonner, Steins last signing as Parkhead boss. “When I played with Derry City, there were some Celtic scouts watching. They were a brilliant club...Sean was assistant manager, but he knew all about Donegal, he had scouts all around there,” McElhinney recalls. They liked what they saw and their  year-old target was invited for trial and was snapped up on a semi-professional arrangement. McElhinney would fit it in around work and was given time off to spend the summer in Glasgow. He played on and off for a season with the clubs reserves. While he was trying keep trim for the boxing back home under Jim Noonans eye in Draperstown, Stein insisted their new signing needed to put on weight. McElhinney was stuck in the middle. “I stayed in a hotel, near Hampden Park, and I used to travel into training every morning. My diet, every other night, was four pints of Guinness in the hotel,” McElhinney joked, having put on a stone and a half. “By the time I came back from Celtic to play for Derry I had went welterweight to middleweight. Arthurhad something to answer, it was very good protein.” Gerry didnt force himself into the first-team at Parkhead, but rubbed shoulders with many future Hoops legends in the reserves side- names like Bobby Lennox, Peter Latchford and George McCluskey. During nearly two hours on the phone, his level of detail is staggering. He never forgets a name. From the Derry players he played with, the soccer battles he had and right down to those he worked for during his summers in America. “A lot of the time, especially in the bad weather, the Celtic first-teamers would playto keep themselves fit,” he continued. At the time, Billy McNeill had left the club. Roddy McDonald was on the books and they brought in Roy Aitken, who would go on to captain the club and win the league and cup double in . McElhinney was surplus to requirements, but his career was far from finished. It was time to head back home, but his career was only beginning. *** Gerry hit the brakes, but nothing happened. The car skidded on the black ice, careered across the road and over the hedge. “Therell be no Castle the night Jim,” Gerry offered, when the car eventually came to a stop. He was referring to the infamous Dungiven night spot and the Jim was Jim McGroarty. McElhinney was dropping him off in Lettershandoney on their way back from a Finn Harps game. “I had to go and get towed out,” McElhinney remembers. “My da was going mad because it was his car and I was in the bad books for a while.” He was on loan from Parkhead to the Harps. He had one game under his belt in centre midfield against Shamrock Rovers, before regular goalkeeper Gerry Murray got injured. In their hour of need, they turned to McElhinney. “I had played in goals for Dungiven and Patsy McGowankicked a few balls at me under lights in a car park in Ballybofey and reckoned I would be a good goalkeeper.” He was never going to stay in goals. Goalkeeper Packie Bonner used the rough and tumble of the Donegal club GAA scene to toughened him. Coming for crosses was a breeze. McElhinney was dferent. Heplayed a dozen games between the posts for the Harps, but wasnt for him. Boredom set in. He missed the banter of being stuck in the middle of a game. “We did alright, we beat Bohemians on a night when I got man of the match and we had some good times,” he said of this time at the club. This spell came during Gerrys GAA career with Derry and during the summer hed jet off to America for work and play a bit of ball. During his time in Philadelphia, he played with FC Berne and he had trials with Chicago Sting. But as  came to a conclusion, so too did his time in the US. *** When Annie McElhinney answered the phone and a thick Scottish accent filtered down the line, the first thought was that Celtic were back in the hunt for her sons signature. It wasnt, but it was an opportunity to kick-start a soccer career that had been parked. It was the voice of Distillery manager Gibby McKenzie. On hisfrom America, Gerry had written to a few clubs askinghe could get a trial. Distillery were the only club to take notice. “Right big man,you want to come and play for us, you can come and play for us,” McKenzie bellowed down the phone. At the time, they had no ground and shared with Brantwood in Antrim. McElhinney got Kenny Shiels and Eugene Young involved in the club. “At that stage, Distillery pretty much finished bottom of the league every season,” Gerry recalls. “Martin ONeill had gone by the time I got there. I played there for a season and done really well.” McKenzie was replaced as boss by Bertie Neill as manager. He arranged for McElhinney to have a trial with English top-flight club Bristol City, who had Joe Royle on their team. “I played against Vancouver Whitecaps, it was a friendly. We drew - and I thought I did fairly well,” Gerry adds. Manager Alan Dicks was impressed by what he saw, but with the clubs financial situation and so many of the squad on long-term contracts. His hands were tied. “I was that down in the dumps, so I decided to go back to America. I came back again at Christmas and went back to Distillery,” he continues. With a good pre-season under his belt, he was playing well and impressed a Bolton Wanderers scout during a friendly away to Drogheda in July . Within a week, McElhinney and Neill were on a plane over to Bolton.  Gerry in his Bolton kit “I played a friendly against Bury FC. It was - and I done quite well and they more or less signed me straight after the game. “Bolton bought me for a fee that rose to around pound, after I had played a certain amount of games and lined out with Northern Ireland. Distillery moved to their new stadium in Lisburn, got the greyhound track and built that big wall. They reckon my transfer paid for that wall. They were really good to me.” *** Anytime Northern Ireland Billy Bingham came to see Billy Hamilton play for Burnley against Bolton his heart mustve been in his mouth. Gerry McElhinney didnt stand on ceremony. He gave as good as he got. During his first two seasons at Bolton, the international call never came despite being on the standby list for the squad in the build-up to the  World Cup in Spain. “I broke my toe. It had came through my boot and I was injured and wouldve never been fit,” McElhinney admits.

Seven games came and went, with McElhinney yet to make an appearance. Their last game was against West Germany, who they had beaten - in Belfast thanks to Ian Stewarts goal earlier in the campaign. With Hamburgs Volksparkstadion filling to an attendance of over ,, Billy Bingham decided to reshuffle his deck and took his Derry contingent to three. Martin ONeill was joined by Paul Ramsay for his second appearance and dropped Chris Nicholl at the expense of Gerry McElhinney for his debut at the age of . Gerry remembers Bingham giving him the news: “Youre playing big man, get yourself sorted out,” he was told. “I didnt think that much about it at the time, it was just a game. You have to understand that I wouldve travelled anywhere for a game of football,” McElhinney said. Just to spice it up, he was up against captain Karl-Heinz Rummenigge who had six goals to his name during the campaign, but the Park mans early tackle laid down a marker. After  minutes, Northern Ireland grew in confidence much to the frustration of the home fans.

Bolton got a combined total of pound, and it kept them afloat. Even though they had been relegated from the first ision, they were still getting really good crowds. “They lost a lot of players, with them not being given contracts.

Hughie Doherty was on the teaching staff and passed on his fascination with sport.The schools gym was a haven for youngsters after school.Basketball, Gaelic football or soccer.It didnt matter.Indeed, it was often after six oclock before McElhinney ed home.“Hughie was the guy who got me to Dungiven Celtic.I was  at the time and I played in goals for them,” said McElhinney.Derry City had withdrawn from the Irish league and before they became affiliated with the League of Ireland in the s, they operated in the realms of junior football.It wasnt long before McElhinney joined them.He recalls how hard it was to get around at the time during The Troubles, but he always found time sport.“I wouldve played football seven days a week,” he said.After an outing for Derry City in the morning, Saturday afternoon would revolved around Dungiven Celtic and before he had played for Banagher on Sunday, McElhinney wouldve fitted in a game with Dungivens Sunday morning league team.He was the oldest in the house and it wasnt he was  that the family home had electricity.The first game he saw televised was the  FA Cup replay.David Webbs injury time winner for Cha over Leeds and a Cha kit received as a present swayed him towards supporting the blues.Performances at the heart of Derry Citys defence brought him to the attention of the other club he supported – Glasgow Celtic.*** DROP CAPITAL ***Jock Steins right-hand man in the Celtic dug-out was Sligo man Sean Fallon, who scouted players such as Kenny Dalglish and goalkeeper Packie Bonner, Steins last signing as Parkhead boss.“When I played with Derry City, there were some Celtic scouts watching.There were a brilliant club...Sean was assistant manager, but he knew all about Donegal, he had scouts all around there,” McElhinney recalls.They liked what they saw and their  year-old target was invited for trial and was snapped up on a semi-professional arrangement.McElhinney would fit it in around work and was given time off to spend the summer in Glasgow.He played on and off for a season with the clubs reserves.While he was trying keep trim for the boxing back home under Jim Noonans eye in Draperstown, Stein insisted their new signing needed to put weight.McElhinney was stuck in the middle.“I stayed in a hotel, near Hampden Park, and I used to travel into training every morning.My diet, every other night, was four pints of Guinness in the hotel,” McElhinney joked, having out on a stone and a half.“By the time I came back from Celtic to play for Derry I had went welterweight to middleweight.Arthurhad something to answer, it was very good protein.”Gerry didnt force himself into the first-team at Parkhead, but rubbed shoulders with many future Hoops legends in the reserves side- names like Bobby Lennox, Peter Latchford and George McCluskey.During nearly two hours on the phone, his level of detail is staggering.He never forgets a name.From the Derry players he played with, the soccer battles he had and right down to those he worked for during his summers in America.“A lot the time, especially in the bad weather, the Celtic first-teamers would play to keep themselves fit,” he continued.At the time, Billy McNeill had left the club.Roddy McDonald was on the books and they brought in Roy Aitken, who would go on to captain the club and win the league and cup double in .McElhinney was surplus to requirements, but his career was far from finished.He was only beginning.*** DROP CAPITAL ***Gerry hit the brakes, but nothing happened.The car skidded on the black ice, careered across the road and over the hedge.“Therell be no Castle the night Jim,” Gerry offered, when the car eventually came to a stop.He was referring to the infamous Dungiven night spot and the Jim was Jim McGroarty.McElhinney was dropping him off in Lettershandoney on their way back from a Finn Harps game.“I had to go and get towed out,” McElhinney remembers.“My da was going mad because it was his car and I was in the bad books for a while.”He was on loan from Parkhead to the Harps.He had one game under his belt in centre midfield against Shamrock Rovers, before regular goalkeeper Gerry Murray got injured. In their hour of need, they turned to McElhinney.“I had played in goals for Dungiven and Patsy McGowankicked a few balls at me under lights in a car park in Ballybofey and reckoned I would be a good goalkeeper.”He was never going to stay.Goalkeeper Packie Bonner had used the rough and tumble of the Donegal club GAA scene to toughened him.Coming for crosses was a breeze.He played a dozen games between the posts, but wasnt for McElhinney though.It bored him.He missed the banter and being stuck in the middle of a game.“We did alight, we beat Bohemians on a night when I got man of the match and we had some good times,” he said of this time at the club.This spell came during Gerrys GAA career with Derry and during the summer hed jet off the America to work and play a bit of ball.During his time in Philadelphia, he played with FC Berne and he had trials with Chicago Sting.But as  came to a conclusion, so too did his time in the US.*** DROP CAPITAL ***When Annie McElhinney answered the phone and a thick Scottish accent filtered down the line, the first thought was that Celtic were back in the hunt for her sons signature.It wasnt, but it was an opportunity to kick-start a soccer career that had been parked.It was the voice of Distillery manager Gibby McKenzie.On hisfrom America, Gerry had written to a few clubs askinghe could get a trial.Distillery were the only club to take notice.“Right big man,you want to come and play for us, you can come and play for us,” McKenzie bellowed down the phone.At the time, they had no ground and shared with Brantwood in Antrim.McElhinney got Kenny Shiels and Eugene Young involved in the club.“At that stage, Distillery pretty much finished bottom of the league every season,” Gerry recalls.“Martin ONeill had gone by the time I got there.I played there for a season and done really well.”McKenzie was replaced as boss by Bertie Neill as manager.He arranged for McElhinney to have a trial with English top-flight club Bristol City, who had Joe Royle on their team.“I played against Vancouver Whitecaps, it was a friendly.We drew - and I thought I did fairly well,” Gerry adds.Manager Alan Dicks was impressed by what he saw, but with the clubs financial situation and so many of the squad on the long-term contracts, his hands were tied.“I was that down in the dumps, so I decided to go back to America.I came back again at Christmas and went back to Distillery,” he continues.With a good pre-season under his belt, he was playing well and impressed a Bolton Wanderers scout during a friendly away to Drogheda in July .Within a week, McElhinney and Neill were on a plane over to Bolton.“I played a friendly against Bury FC.It was - and I done quite well and they more of less signed me straight after the game.“Bolton bought me for a fee that rose to arund pound, after I had played a certain amount of games and lined out with Northern Ireland.Distillery moved to their new stadium in Lisburn, got the greyhound track and built that big wall.They reckon my transfer paid for that wall.They were really good to me.”*** DROP CAPITAL ***Anytime Northern Ireland Billy Bingham came to see Billy Hamilton play for Burnley against Bolton his heart mustve been in his mouth.Gerry McElhinney didnt stand on ceremony.He gave as good as he got.During his first two seasons at Bolton, the international call never came despite being on the standby list for the squad in the build-up to the  World Cup in Spain.“I broke my toe.It had came through my boot and I was injured and wouldve never been fit,” McElhinney admits.Later in his Bolton career, after ing from a -game spell at Rochdale, he forced himself into first-team and his form earned him an international call-up, with the  European Championships around the corner.Seven games came and went, with McElhinney yet to make an appearance.Their last game was against West Germany, who they had beaten - in Belfast thanks to Ian Stewarts goal earlier in the campaign.With Hamburgs Volksparkstadion filling to an attendance of over ,, Billy Bingham decided to reshuffle his deck and took his Derry contingent to three.Martin ONeill was joined by Paul Ramsay for his second appearance and dropped Chris Nicholl at the expense of Gerry McElhinney for his debut at the age of .Gerry remembers Bingham giving him the news: “Youre playing big man, get yourself sorted out,” he was told.“I didnt think that much about it at the time, it was just a game.You have to understand that I wouldve travelled anywhere for a game of football,” McElhinney said.Just to spice it up, he was up against captain Karl-Heinz Rummenigge who had six goals to his name during the campaign, but the Park mans early tackle laid down a marker.After  minutes, Northern Ireland grew in confidence much to the frustration of the home fans.Early in the second half, Harald Schumacher failed to hold an Ian Stewart effort and when Ramsays shot was blocked, Norman Whiteside fired them into a - lead.McElhinney was part of the back four that thwarted the Germans and on the once occasion they threatened to beat goalkeeper Pat Jennings, Jimmy Nicholl cleared the ball off the line from Lothar Matthaus shot.For four days, Northern Ireland led West Germany by three points in the one qualying spot.“They had a game in hand against Albania to qualy and a win would put them through on score dference,” McElhinney can remember.Their chances were not out of their own hands.The Albanians took an early lead, only for Rummenigge to immediately level the game and with  minutes to go, Gerhard Stracks goal ended their qualication dreams.“After that, I played for Northern Ireland in the Home Championships and we were the last winners of it in ,” McElhinney adds.In the first game, they were - winners over Scotland side that included Roy Aitken.McElhinney nearly score a third and after the game the Scots manager Jock Stein admitted to McElhinney that he shouldve kept him on at Celtic.*** DROP CAPITAL ***By Christmas of , Bolton were in the third tier of the league and their bank accounts didnt make for pleasantreading.Aside from a squad of kids, McElhinney and Jeff Chander were the only senior players they could sell to help their plight.“He went to Derby County and I went Plymouth.Bolton got a combined total of pound, and it kept them afloat.Even though they had been relegated from the first ision, they were still getting really good crowds.“They lost a lot of players, with them not been given contracts.Nothing has changed with Bolton, they still have got no money.”During his four years at Plymouth, McElhinney was captain for two seasons as they gained promotion to the old second ision.In his first season,  , he helped tighten up their defence, helping them begin their climb – beginning with a - win over Bolton early in his spell.The following year, Argyle were promoted in second place.”We beat Bristol City in a mid-week game to seal promotion.Reading won it, we were second and Derby County came third,” McElhinney remembers.His Gaelic career was beginning to take prominence back home and after steering Gortin to the final of the Tyrone senior championship – a game be missed due to Boltons pre-season – he transferred back to Craigbane.“A lot of the guys who sign for Plymouth never leave that area.It is a lovely and Cornwall is on your doorstep,” explains McElhinney, who had the opportunity of following his promotion winning manager to picturesque Torquay. “I was coming home, every now and then, playing Gaelic football on the sly.To come home and play, I had to drive from Plymouth to London to get a flight home.I thought Id move a bit closer, so I moved to Peterborough.”When Peterborough gained promotion in the  season, Gerry was the youth team coach before moving to non-league Corby Town for two seasons at the end of his career.Gerry now lives in Draycott, near Derby where he currently works in construction.He is still fanatical about sport.He is also a guest at Bolton on match-days days and takes part in an open mic question and answer session.“Plymouth get me down too, I am part of the Plymouth Argyle legends and I got my free tie,” he laughs.Gerry McElhinney – a legend on both sides of the pond.\"More...

This follows commitments made by ministers over the weekend that the government will meet with the two representativebodies for publicans over course of the coming week.As part of their discussions with the government, the two organisations will be pressing for pubs to reopen at the same time and on the same basis as cafes and restaurants. Recognising the challenge of maintaining social distancing in a hospitality environment, the organisations will also be putting forward radical changes to the normal operations of barsin order to protect public health.These measures include: googletag.cmd.push • Bars will become dispense bars only with no sitting, standing, ordering, payment or drinking at the bar allowed. • Table service will be a requirement with pubs only serving customers seated at tables. • The numbers on the premises would be confined to no more than  per every  square metres. • A maximum of  people would be permitted at any one table. • Customers will be required to use hand sanitiser upon entry. • All customers must remain seated. • Staff will be fully trained in the new procedures. They will also be asked to maintain a safe distance from customers when taking orders and to wash their hands thoroughlyevery  minutes. googletag.cmd.push • The utilisation of outdoor spaces to enhance social distancing. • Procedures implemented to ensure safe use of toilet facilities, which may include limits on the numbers using toilets at any one time. • No live music or DJs. Speaking about the proposed measures, Donall O’Keeffe, Chief Executive of the LVA said, “We fully respect the need to continue to protect the public health. We have repeatedlyproven this commitment, not least in the fact that our sector was the first to close across the country. We also believe thatother venues who serve food and alcohol are allowed toreopen in Phase , then pubs should be granted the same opportunity to trade. We don’t believe it is in any way appropriate that the Government should apply one rule for somehospitality businesses and another rule for others.“We are making a series of radical proposals to how bars should operate for the reopening scenario. Trading will be extremely dficult under these circumstances. There is no doubtthat the pub experience as we know it will have to change dramatically. Many pubs may choose not to reopen as it simply won’t be financially viable under these conditions.However, for those who want to trade, these measures will have the essential impact of protecting the health and wellbeing of staff and customers alike,” Mr. O’Keeffe said.

Plans have been put forward to construct the new footbridge as part of a proposal to extend Derrys popular quayside walk and cycle path. Derry City and Strabane District Council has applied for planning permission to build the footbridge across an inlet close to the Fort George site. This would allow the quayside walkway to be extended into the Bay Road area. There are also plans to create a new three-metre wide cycle walking path along Bay Road to link in to the Bay Road Park. Derrys quay has been revitalised in recent years and the latest proposal looks set to continue the regeneration of the riverside area. googletag.cmd.push The plans for the new footbridge and walkway are now being considered by the local councils planning department. Meanwhile, a new cycling champion role has been created to encourage more people to get on their bikes in Derry. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon this week announced a new walking and cycling champion with a focus on transforming communities and developing creative solutions to support a new way of living during and post COVID-. “Our champion will ensure that we deliver our commitment to increase the percentage of journeys made by walking and cycling. Inspiring our communities, restructuring our spaces, changing forever the way we live – and changing it for the better,” said the Minister. googletag.cmd.push “I want to increase the space available for people who want to walk and cycle by extending pavements, pedestrianising streetsand introducing pop up cycle lanes. I have already identied someparts ofBelfast City Centre and Derry city that can betransformed in this wayand I intend to work with councils to identy more areas across the North as a matter of urgency. Changing how we use our spaces will transform communities right across Northern Ireland – creatively change lives – enable social distancing and encourage health and mental wellbeing. “Thisenvironmental and public healthwork will be done on a collaborative basis, with an action group, formed from both within and outside government. I also want to work in collaboration with communities, including identying and creating ‘Quiet Streets’ where pedestrians, cyclists and play have priority and motor vehicles are guests,” added Ms Mallon. “As the Executive looks this week to review thelockdown – we all need to be looking ahead – out of the darkness of this pandemic and into a better world that we need to build for ourselves. Greener, cleaner, healthier and happier people and places must be our aim as we learn to live with this new normal during and after Covid-.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The full nature of the financial crisis facing the local council was made public for the first time today. In a report by senior council officers brought before a special meeting of the council, it was stated that the council is currently incurring losses of around pound, per month as a result of the closure of facilities and services. The local authority is also having to cope with additional waste management costs and exceptional emergency expenditure as a result of the coronavirus crisis. googletag.cmd.push The council report stated: This will likely be worsened following the first quarter as the impact of the pandemic hits Council’s rate-base and the current rates relief scheme for business comes to an end. Whilst a regional bid is currently being considered by Central Government, this has not yet been confirmed and may only part fund some of the financial loss being incurred. At this point, it is therefore clear that reserves will not be adequate to fund Council services for the year ahead and Council will be in a position of insolvency by September .  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Like all of us, hersquos patiently waiting for when thingsto normal and travel is possible again.ldquoI definitely havenrsquot spent more than at couple of weeks at home since  when my father George died, explains Tim. ldquoItrsquos a real shame that I canlsquot really enjoy everything that Co Down has to offer, but at least home is a good spot. Myself and my mother enjoy going out for a walk along the Quoile river every now and then.The third of four children, Tim has an older sister, Heather, and two brothers, Michael and Pat. Their late father was a highly respected lawyer, who became a county court judge.Ash, the band Tim founded in  at the age of  with fellow Down High School students Mark Hamilton, also from Downpatrick, and Rick McMurray, from Killyleagh, exploded on to the Britpop scene in the mid-s. Known as one of the softer alternative rockpop bands, Ash put Downpatrick well and truly on the music map. Along with the success of the Papenfus brothers, Kenneth and Carl, with their band Relish, and local rockers, The Answer, it was a golden age for music for the town and district.Tim and the band have been recording and touring ever since, having recently embarked on a European tour to support their new specially compiled album, Best of Teenage Wildle ndash  years of Ash. Coming in a combination of vinyl, a special  CD with an  rare track CD, Teenage Wildle has charted well so far, coming top in both the UK and Irish Independent Albums chart and th in the UK Album chart.When President Donald Trump closed the US airports in March, it could not have come at a worst time for the band in promotional terms.Tim explained: ldquoWe were in the middle of European tour in February and everything was just gradually grinding to a standstill. At that time, I did thinkI didnrsquot leave for New York soon there was a chance that I wouldnrsquot get back for two to three months.ldquoBut our UK dates were the following week and they still hadnlsquot been cancelled. I felt that I didnrsquot have a choice so we stayed and we spent three days driving to Hamburg to a gig which got cancelled on the day. We travelled back to the UK and then the tour dates got cancelled the day before the first show was meant to have been held. It was too late for me at that point to get back to the US so I came back to Northern Ireland and stayed at my sisterrsquos place for a week before I went to Downpatrick.While he is enjoying his downtime in Downpatrick, rehoning lyrics to songs he first started several years ago, Tim is naturally concerned about when andhe will get back to New York.ldquoIrsquom technically a temporary resident so Irsquom worried about getting back to the US as Irsquom not a citizen or permanent resident. I was planning to move to London in July as we have a recording studio there with a lease ending soon and we need to move equipment out over the next few months. Thatrsquos all a big question mark now. Irsquove been in New York for  years and would like a chance to say goodbye to everyone.Although the change of pace is dferent at home compared to New York, both are close to Timrsquos heart.ldquoThe number one thing about New York that I love are the people. Itrsquos such an amazing mixof cultures. It has so much energy to the place. The pace is really fast, itrsquos endlessly interesting, he said.ldquoBut Irsquove always been comfortable about coming back to Northern Ireland. We are surrounded by woodland and the Quoile river.

I like going between the two extremes, itrsquos a really good place to be writing, reading and walking around.Tim recently connected with the world of music globally when he broadcast a live performance from his Downpatrick home to raise money for struggling musicians and artists impacted by the coronavirus lockdown. Organised by the Performing Rights Society , which pays royalties to members when their work is performed in whatever , Tim was one of  big names who took part.He started off with a rendition of his hit, Girl From Mars, performed with an acoustic guitar, and played Shining Light, which he won an Ivor Novello award in  for Best Contemporary Pop Song, finishing off with Teenage Kicks by Derry band The Undertones.ldquoThat felt really good and I felt really connected it was good seeing all the comments coming up, said Tim. ldquoBut to be honest, it was nerve-wrecking doing a broadcast from home as the internet is not too good here. Normally on stage you would have fears of your equipment failing but I was just thinking I hope that this internet does not cut out. If the phone rings the home, the internet cuts out. I was praying that no one would ring my mum in the middle of it.ldquoIt just dawned on me while I was singing Shining Light that I had written it in the same room where I was broadcasting from. Irsquove written a lot of good songs in that room.He joked at how long it normally takes him to release new music and how he is still working on songs he wrote several years ago.ldquoThe guys and I have been chatting a lot still and Irsquove been sending them song ideas and discussing things but I really wish we could get into a rehearsal room and jam through the stuff. Maybe we will get to do that in a few weeksrsquo time.ldquoItrsquos going to be interesting to see what new music comes out from artists after the lockdown but Irsquom always on a bit of a lag with new stuff as by the time Irsquove written a new song and wersquore recorded it, itrsquos three years later.

However, more sewers are coming on to help out as word spreads about the initiative.The club put out a call for people to help with the sewing and donations of material and were overwhelmed with the response.Mrs Fowler explained that the group came about after she was approached privately by some peopleshe knew anyone who could provide scrubs.ldquoWe started at the beginning of the month and so far we have made scrubs for four nursing homes, including Barrhall Residential Home in Portaferry, and supplied scrubs to Loughview Medical Centre in Kircubbin and Ballywalter Health Centre.ldquoWe have also supplied scrubs to nurses at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as well to nurses in the Nightingale Hospital in Belfast City Tower Block through my sister-in-lawrsquos niece who is a nurse. We are now filling orders from Positive Futures, a group who visit people with learning disabilities who vulnerable, in their own homes and had absolutely no protective gear.

Only last month, all the hanging baskets produced at the New Model Farm site sold out.Locate at the site are two poly tunnels, flower beds and vegetable patches cocooned into a corner of the housing estate, with the apiary also a big hit with beekeepers who have honed their skills with the help of the Killinchy Beekeepers.Allotment holders and groups using the site regularly produce an array of fresh vegetables, flowers and bedding plants, while the beekeepers are producing their own delicious honey which is in its natural state with no additives.Sean Clarke, who is the chairman of Downpatrick Community Allotments, says there is nothing like working in the great outdoors, filling your lungs with fresh air and clearing your mind.ldquoAll our plots are currently taken but we are looking for new volunteers, he explained.ldquoWhen one of our plots does become available, it is snapped up immediately. Some of the townrsquos residentsrsquo groups have taken plots and we are delighted to have a mix of all abilities working at the site.ldquoThere is great camaraderie and we have our very own gardening guru mdash Stephen Harris.ldquoHe is brilliant to have around the place and has an encyclopaedic knowledge of gardening which is being passed on to the volunteers. Stephen once had his own landscaping business and is more than happy to share is extensive knowledge with us.Downpatrick Community Allotments now has its own Facebook page packed with photos and information about what is happening at the New Model Farm site with the social media page helping generate wide interest in what is going on there.ldquoMany people have come along to learn gardening skills including seed planting, propagation and how to fill hanging baskets and it is clear to see their enthusiasm. It is great to be outdoors and enjoying the benefits of physical exercise and fresh air, Sean continued, revealing that within three days of all the hanging baskets produced going on sale they sold out.Given the focus on greater public health awareness as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, all the equipment at the allotments is sanitised before and after use and social distancing regulations are enforced across the site, both at the allotments, in the poly tunnels and apiary.ldquoEveryone is always two metres apart and due to the size of the allotments, three people can work comfortably at the same time, while adhering to the social distancing guidelines.Sean is a great believer in how working at the Model Farm site is good for mental health and said there are many studies which back up his assertion.ldquoPeople really get a lot out of seeing the flowers and vegetables they plant growing and there is always a great buzz about the place. The allotments can certainly help people destress, especially in the current climate.It was planned to bring along a chef to the allotments so the volunteers can learn ious ways they can cook their fresh vegetables and while this has had to be put on hold, it is something Sean is keen to see happening when the pandemic is brought under control and the current lockdown regulations are relaxed.He added: ldquoWe are hoping that we may be able get a chef in around September, but that will depend on the current restrictions being eased.For further information on Downpatrick Community Allotments pay a visit to the grouprsquos Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Council.jpg","title":"Council has no plans to lay off current staff  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has this week insisted that it has no current plans to lay off staff.The confirmation comes after Antrim and Newtownabbey Council confirmed last week that it was planning to make a number of employees redundant, with  jobs affected.However, officials subsequently deferred a decision on  positions, but  agency staff are to be let go due to funding pressures during the coronavirus pandemic.Defending its decision to cut jobs, the council said it had faced an ldquounprecedented financial challenge due to signicantly reduced revenues following the closure of public facilities.It also confirmed there has been ldquono confirmation of any additional funding being provided to councils from government and the UK-wide furlough scheme is not expected to be used by local authorities.While the planned job losses are subject to negotiations with trade unions, Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey made it clear that she will not support actions of councilsthey do not respect and protect workersrsquo rights.The minister said that each of Northern Irelandrsquos  councils mdash including Newry, Mourne and Down.ldquoI call on councils and other employers to do all in their power to safeguard jobs so that when the current restrictions are lted, those very workers can contribute to the economic recovery that we will so badly need, she remarked.The Northern Ireland Local Government Associationmdash the umbrella body for the provincersquos  councils mdash said councils were facing ldquoshort and long-term financial pressures like never before.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that no decision has been taken in relation to reducing staff number ldquoat this time.Former NILGA president and Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos announcement.ldquoThese are unprecedented times and the local authority has lost a signicant amount of income given the closure of leisure and community facilities across the district, he said.ldquoVarious staff have been redeployed across the organisation and at these terribly dficult times, they are working to maintain services with others playing key roles in helping to deliver food packages to residents across the district.Cllr Curran said he would not want to see anyone losing their job and hopes the local council will continue to work hard to make sure this does happen anywhere within the organisation.ldquoNo one could have predicted the situation we now find ourselves in, he continued. ldquoItrsquos important that the public plays its part, stays at homeit all possible and when out, exercise social distancing to help protect the HNS and save lives.ldquoMany people have lost their jobs through no fault of their own and I hope that in the not too distant future, lockdown measures will start to be eased to help rebuild the local economy and people can get back to work.He added: ldquoThis will not happen overnight, but the more we obey public health advice now, the sooner the lockdown can be eased..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Evan.jpg","title":"Evan and mum raising dough for charity during virus lockdown  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE woman and her little son have been busy baking tasty treats on social media to help raise money for a local mental health charity since the lockdown began.When Pauline Smyth was forced to close the doors of the Blue Bay Cafe in Dundrum due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus, she and two year-old Evan took to baking some of their favourite recipes.For almost four weeks, the pair have stirred, sted and simmered their way through a mountain of ingredients, making everything from pizza pin wheels to Portuguese custard tarts and posting snap shots of their combined efforts on the Blue Bay Cafe  Bakery Facebook page, along with the recipes.Pauline says Evan loves to help out, especially when it comes to making doughnuts.

second week of serious assaults which left one local man requiring hospital treatment for sustained severe head injuries, inflicted during a vicious attack at the Bishopsbrae area.Mr McGuigan has also highlighted an incident when a family were forced to flee their Leaside Gardens home in the Flying Horse estate after a malicious blaze.In addition, two other young men were bundled into a car and taken to the Steamboat Quay area at the Quoile River where they were assaulted.Two weeks ago, an ongoing feud between two Downpatrick families was blamed for a shooting incident at the Vianstown Park area in the town and an assault on a woman in Church Street.Mr McGuigan says he is concerned at the number of recent events, which include a local family having to be rehoused in emergency accommodation, and claims they paint a very wrong picture of the county town.The police chief said the sequence of recent events does nothing to enhance Downpatrickrsquos reputation and said people who live in a civilised community must accept the rule oflaw.DUNDRUM ndash A Dundrum man confronted a skinhead burglar in his home during the early hours of Monday morning and forced him to flee the

The county was a footballing powerhouse once more, landing two All-Ireland titles in the space of three years and the players secured their place in GAA folklore.An immovable force was their goalkeeper Neil Collins. He thwarted Meath in the  and in  memorably saved a penalty from Dublin danger man Charlie Coleman.Now a youthful , Neil began his football career with Ballymartin and then with Drumaness. But he is best known for his association with Carryduff. He broke into the Down senior  in  and remained in the squad for ten years.He remained a dedicated servant of Down long after his playing career ended. He managed the county U- team for three years, was goalkeeping coach of the senior team for six years and also a selector for three years when the team was managed by his All-Ireland-winning colleague, the late and much missed Eamonn Burns.Neil hasnrsquot included himself in his  greatest Down players, but for the others donrsquot look much further than his team-mates from the early Nineties.ldquoThese were the players I grew up with, so I have to stick with them. Irsquom too young to remember the Sixties, he says.ldquoI had a great time with Down. Obviously the highlights were winning the two All-Irelandrsquos, but I have wonderful memories of the people I played with and all the friendships.ldquoThanks to WhatsApp I am in contact with them every day. We had the th reunion of the  team in Dublin last year and we also got together to remember the th anniversary of the Loughinisland tragedy.ldquoThey are a great bunch of lads, but you canrsquot put a foot wrong, otherwise you would be pulled up very quickly. Pat DonnanPat was goalkeeper for the Down minors which won the All-Ireland title in  and was goalkeeper for the senior team for many years. He was a great keeper and became a mentor to me. He took me under his wing and made me a better player. He was also generous with time and advice. A great goalkeeper and an even greater man. Miceal MagillThis is the most dficult pick. It was between Miceal and Brendan McKernan, but I have gone for Miceal, largely because of his performance in the  final which won him the Ulster Bank Man of the Match award. He had a fantastic game and never let Charlie Redmond get away from him. He was always comfortable with the ball and could read a game well. Conor DeeganConor was a tremendous athlete and he could take on the oppositionrsquos biggest players. He always seemed to get on top of his opponents and I never once saw him roasted. He had terric hands and he could read a game as well as anyone. He always encouraged those around him. He was a true team player. Paul HigginsPaul was as hard as nails and he was also the quickest player in the squad, even faster than Mickey Linden. He dominated and bullied his opponents and he had great strength of character. John KellyMy Carryduff clubmate and a ruthless, nasty player in the best possible way. He was the sort of player nobody wanted to mark, whether in a match or in training. He would put his head where others feared to put their feet. Barry BreenAnother double All-Ireland winner. I first played with him at the Red High. Barry always seemed to have time on the ball. He played at a dferent level to everyone . What set him apart though was that he could play with his head up and see what was going on. He was always looking for someone off the ball. DJ KaneOur captain in  and an inspirational leader. DJ was one of the most competitive players I have seen in my le. He would not lie down and did not know what it meant to be beaten. It was win at all costs and he was someone you needed when things got bad. Gregory McCartanA massive character both on and off the pitch. Gregory kept the craic going in the changing room and in the bar afterwards. But he was also a tremendous footballer. He could take a free with either foot. He put money on himself to get the first score in the  final, which he did. Eamonn BurnsAn absolute gentleman, but a warrior on the pitch. He was quiet and unassuming, but had everything you wanted in a player. He scored two sublime points in the , which we won by two points, so he played a huge part in getting us over the line. His death came as a great shock. He is a much missed colleague. Ross CarrA Rolls Royce footballer. He had a wonderful left foot and was one of our two main free takers. Ross had a massive amount of inward drive and challenged us all to perform to the same high standards which he set for himself. Greg Blaney . Quite simply the best player I ever played with. He had it all. He was a brilliant ball player who made the forward line tick. He was always looking to play in James McCartan or Mickey Linden and wasnrsquot worried about scoring himself. An absolute team player. Gary MasonA superb free taker, particularly when under pressure. He never failed us. In June  he played for Down against Monaghan. It was the day after the Loughinisland tragedy. He must have been under enormous mental pressure and anguish, but he put on a massive exhibition and was man of the match. Mickey LindenWhat can you say about Mickey  He was an absolute flying machine and totally dedicated to Down football. He was still playing county football at the age of . A player of exceptional ability and one of the nicest men you could meet off the pitch. Peter WithnellA big, strong one-man wrecking ball. He would hit opponents very hard and early on. Peter brought something dferent to the team and his game fitted in well with the players Down manager Peter McGrath put around him. Many of their scores came about because of him. James McCartanConfident and aggressive with the ability to find space where he had no right to. Every time James got the ball, there was a buzz in the crowd. He was man of the match in the  All-Ireland final. He went on to manage Down and took them to the  final.Substitutes: Brendan McKernan , Aidan Farrell , Liam Austin , Ambrose Rogers Sr , Ciaran McCabe ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Heather.jpg","title":"Heather coaching the kids  ","story":"A COMBER soccer coach is keeping local children on the ball mdash despite the coronavirus shutdown.Heather Kerr normally coaches primary school children, but now she is passing on her skills online and on social media.Heather, a player and coach with Comber Ladies and an Irish FA staff member, admits it can be a challenge keeping children active and entertained in the current lockdown, but she believes she has the answers.Heather is also a key member of the IFArsquos Electric Ireland Shooting Stars programme aimed at young girls and she says keeping it fun is the key to keeping kids engaged with their extra-curricular activities.ldquoItrsquos all about making sure that they are having fun while learning something new, she says.ldquoEven though your little ones arenrsquot getting out on the pitch they can still be trying out new skills at home.Heather has been involved in football since an early age and was inspired by her dad, who was a coach.ldquoI started volunteering with the youth section of my local club, Comber Rec when I was , and Irsquove been involved in some sort of coaching ever since, she explained.ldquoI completed a weekrsquos work experience with the Irish FA around this time too and I really got a taste of all the dferent aspects of what is involved in football development.ldquoOver the years I worked through my coaching badges and recently completed my A Licence.ldquoI have been coaching in primary schools for the Irish FA since .

I havenrsquot been running for a few years now but I was persuaded to get up off my rear end and try to mark the th anniversary of the postponed London marathon due to be held on the very appropriate th April by running or walking or generally moving over a distance of  or . miles or kilometres.And having sorted out a route around my garden, estimated to be  metres long, I worked out that  laps per mile would be achievable over the five days specied mdash i.e. I could walk  laps to count as . miles.

My biggestfear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part.Double runshave always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon. Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to be running the Belfast Marathon this weekend, but your chance to do so will come around again in the future. Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness. More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months.Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.ldquoYes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training . So we have to love the training too.Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey.ldquoTo those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.Club updateThese words echo the sentiment of all of us and we commend all key workers who have been put in the front line in the course of their work. We have many EDAC members who are in that position and we send them our best wishes.So what of the last six weeks  The clubrooms were closed with immediate effect and the committee advised all members of the governmental advice to stay home and stay safe. The only good news was that there was no ban on exercising so long as training was done solo or in household groups.It may seem crass to be concerned about the ability to train when there are much bigger issues at stake, but it is well known that sticking to some routine is beneficial in keeping mental health in good order and anything which allows us to be positive will help us to cope with the situation that has evolved.Most have been taking daily exercise as prescribed by the government as it is already a part of our daily routine. However, because of the restrictions on movements and associations and the change of routine for many, whether through being laid off work, working from home, working for NHS at the coal face so to speak, or any of above combined with the added dficulties of home schooling kids of whatever age, it means that many runners are no longer free to go for a run whenever they chose or indeed will have to make signicant changes to their daily routine to fit it in.Some have turned their daily run into a practical outing where they canessential items to those who are shielding. Others have managed to combine their exercise with fund raising for charities involved in the frontline or for organisations who will see their funding hit by the economic fallout of the pandemic.Our juniors could be forgiven for thinking this is an unexpected long summer break, but they report back from time to time to log that fact that they are knuckling down to home schooling while using exercise to take a break.Jarlath and Anna Kearney have committed to a daily .k run, Mackenzie and Ky Murray have been out with their dad, Dee, making sure he doesnrsquot slack. Mackenzie even recorded an unofficial K PB this week.Ollie and Alex Robinson have the good fortune to be able to train as a family and they push each other as well as mum Marguerite. It is no surprise that dedicated athlete Lauren Madine is training away in between exercising the horses. Others such as Emily Burns have opted to cross train.If baking was an Olympic event, there would be a few EDAC records set there too by the sound of things. Tik Tok also seems to be a favourite occupation with some slick dance routines doing the rounds. The one thing that is clear is that our juniors miss their club mates but that physical exercise in any form is a big help. We are proud of our juniors for this mature approach and urge them to continue their efforts.Virtual challengesSome of the races that have been cancelled have then gone ahead in a virtual form, the Titanic K being one. Runners were invited to run a solo K on any course near their home and record the time.Three EDAC runners claimed the reward mdash a T-shirt and medal in the post. Gareth Reilly was the quickest of the trio, posting a -minute time. Hallie Jennings stole a march on Donal Smith by a couple of minutes mdash  minutes to his  mdash but with all runners doing dferent courses it was mainly for fun.Also for fun and the motivation to keep going was the Galbally Runners April Challenge. A simple concept where each runner chose a target of ,, or  miles etc and then had a month to complete. Evidence was submitted by Strava or fitness watch records.Kelly Smith and Donal Smith blew their goals out of the water with totals over  miles each. Marguerite Robinson, Hallie Jennings and Suzy Smith broke  miles in their inidual sessions and Alison Carroll completed a conservative  miles to start a new regime. They all agreed that it was a good way to keep base fitness. Buffs are apparently in the post and thanks are due to Galbally Runners for sorting this.Some runners were racking up the miles and others were thinking of improving speed. Jimmy Sloan has been following a programme which is hard without club members to egg him on, but he has been very successful nonetheless with a new K PB of .. All times are, of course, unofficial as they are not on measured courses but they are a good indicator of form.Jimmy was taking part in the NHS Run , Donate , Nominate . Many of our members will have taken part and the fun can be in nominating friends who would hate to run five km, let alone five miles mdash they canrsquot really refuse when it is for such a good cause!Every club has its mile munchers and in normal times Phillip Vint would see a weekend without a marathon as a waste of a free day. Like others, he has had to get used to a new normal, but when the weekend of the postponed London Marathon came round, he couldnrsquot resist setting off on a . mile course close to home to mark the day.No crowds to cheer him on and no sights of London to entertain him en route, but he was glad that he had the health to complete it. Predictably with the Belfast Marathon also called off, he repeated his endeavours seven days later and clocked another marathon with ease.The best bit is that the finish line is his own back door so no painful walk back to get the car or the train. He was straight to the sofa in seconds and recovery could begin.Donal Smith was to have completed his inaugural marathon at Belfast , as was his daughter, Kelly. Again their hard training seemed lost without a cause, but they had followed the programme to the letter and felt that they needed to test the waters.They set off to give it a rattle and coped well with the dry run of the full marathon distance. They were delighted to get the odd toot and cheer as a substitute for race day atmosphere and they received hearty congratulations when they posted their achievement on social media.While it would have been nice to have friends and family there to greet them at the finish line, it just means that they will have the incentive to do it all again when an official Belfast Marathon can eventually take place. At least they know that they can cope with the mileage and surely with the crowd support it can only be easier Last, but not least, EDAC ultra man himself Keith Reilly has been thinking up ways to raise money and satisfy his need for a challenge at the same time. He decided that his lockdown event would be a treadmill ultra and that he would appeal for funds for NHS Charities Together.He managed . miles running in hourly shts which is no mean feat on a treadmill and logged his th ultra marathon. He was delighted to announce a total of pound, for the frontline workers dealing with Covid- patients. A good dayrsquos work all round.So there you have it from both ends of the scale mdash what the top runners think and do and what the rest of us do. Not a lot of dference really is there  Letrsquos all continue to play by the rules and hope for better times. Stay safe and see you all when the lockdown is lted..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Loughinisland.jpg","title":"Loughinisland woman ‘was friend to all’  ","story":"THE artist son of a Loughinisland woman who has died has said his mother was his ldquobiggest fan.Sixty-four year-old Mrs Kate Sloan was buried in St Macartanrsquos New Cemetery in Loughinisland on Saturday.

on the latest phase of a mains gas pipe-laying scheme.The Recorder revealed last week that Phoenix Natural Gas has seized the opportunity to make the most of the coronavirus lockdown by bringing forward work on the scheme in the resort as part of its poundm investment programme across East Down.Work started last week at the Dundrum Road and Railway Street junctions with Main Street, with contractors switching attention to a stretch of road between the Railway Street junction and Castle Bridge, adjacent to Newcastle library, from this week.Next Monday, it is planned to lay a section of mains pipe between Castle Bridge and the Bryansford Road junction, while seven days later, contractors will be laying pipework along the Bryansford Road, between the Central Promenade and Shimna road junctions.This particular part of the scheme concludes with a pipe being laid between the Bryansford Road and Bryansford Avenue junctions at Shimna Road.Work in the town centre was scheduled to start towards the end of the year, but Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward in order to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents.Phoenix says it understands that Covid- has had a signicant impact socially and economically across the region and hopes that by expediting its works in Newcastle, it can utilise the lockdown period to not only avoid further disruption later in the year, but enable more people to have access to fuel choice before the winter period.The works will involve one lane closure mdash rather than a full road closure mdash with traffic management plans also in place and Phoenix aiming to utilise underground drilling equipment where possible.In

run now, and that the thing I have to do and the thingI always look forward to, she said.ldquoTherersquos days Irsquove cried and been like, lsquoWhat the hell is this rsquo Irsquove chatted to my

Balance, Ciara lives in Manchester in the same house with fellow athletes Jip Vastenburg and Adam Craig. Right now shersquos spending a lot more time inside the house than outside.ldquoThankfully my training hasnrsquot changed hugely, but wersquore in the house an awful lot more. The whole season has disappeared, which is very strange because wersquore training without any real focus.ldquoWersquore all watching the news and seeing whatrsquos happening the world over, and wersquore all far away from our families.ldquoLast week Jip lost her grandmother and she couldnrsquot get home for the funeral mdash she had to watch it over Skype.Ciara is worried about members of her own family. Her elder sister, Myra, is a registrar at a hospital in Belfast, her younger sister, Nuala, is a nursing student, younger brother Brendan has volunteered to work in the Nightingale hospital in London and her mother, Catherine, also works in the NHS, while an aunt is a pharmacist.

Irsquom not quite sure when Irsquoll get to see him next as Irsquom in Manchester and he is in Dublin so itrsquos a nice way to start my day and always puts a smile on my face.Q Whatrsquos your favourite exercise A Oh I feel like I should say running, as I am an athlete, butI was to think of my favourite it would probably be a few things. I do miss playing a team sport so probably camogie, I absolutely loved dodge ball in school sothat was an option Irsquod pick that, and I do enjoy my gym workouts getting to lt weights.Q Is there one particular skill you practice every day A Running, every day! Running is a gross motor sport so fine skills arenrsquot really a part of my daily training, but I do work on dferent areas of my fitness every day. I have to work on things such as flexibility and fine muscle control every day to keep myself injury free. In the athlete house though we have been honing dferent skills while on lockdown, trying out dferent Tik Tok dances, press ups, and trying to get our eye in with the sling shot in the back garden!Q Netflix and chill or a nice evening jog A Both, usually we have an evening run, easy four miles... then we chill and watch a movie after dinner. We have had to mix training up a bit with the changes but in an ideal world we get both in.Q Name one book you want to read.A Irsquom making my way through a few Malcolm Gladwell books. I love coming away with new information and enjoy a book that challenges my thought process. Then when I need to flake out Irsquod pick something like A Man Called Ove. Soanyone could recommend books like this to me theyrsquod be on my ldquowant to read list.Q On a scale of  to , how good are your DIY skills A Ohhhh, Irsquom going to give myself an . -  here. My daddy is a joiner so I spent my le watching him make and fix things, and soon learned the names of tools and how to use them. I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room! I actually enjoy housework, everywhere but my own bedroom. Irsquoll clean all day but canrsquot be bothered with my own mess!Q Favourite room of the house to spend time in A We are lucky that the Team NB Manchester athlete house is lovely and has lots of space so my favourite room ies depending in the time of day. In the morning my bedroom gets lovely light, it makes me smile sitting there chilling. Then when I want a bit of company the front room or kitchen is where we chill as a team and have the craic... andthe sun shines, which it does on the odd occasion over here, we have a lovely garden.Both Jip and Adam are enjoying learning how to puck about with my hurl..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Recycling.jpg","title":"Recycling facilities to reopen  ","story":"THE districtrsquos household recycling centres could reopen next week.Located in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, the centres closed at the end of March in line with the government directive to help reduce the spread of coronavirus.The Recorder understands that the sites will reopen, provided Newry, Mourne and Down Council can satisfy itself that the move can be managed safely and there is no risk to the public or frontline staff.Mid and East Antrim Council has already opened its recycling centres and Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots recently published guidelines aimed at paving the way for waste centres across the province to reopen.The reopening is expected to be discussed at todayrsquos virtual meeting between senior council officials and the leaders of the main political parties.Members of the local authorityrsquos senior management team are currently evaluating theenvironment ministerrsquos guidelines and developing a staff plan to allow the reopening to proceed in a safe way.In addition, officers are liaising with their recycling contractors, a number of whom have furloughed staff. The contractors are responsible for removing waste from all  council amenity sites, with early suggestions that it could take at least one week to ready themselves for reopening.With strict guidelines in relation to social distancing remaining in place, council officers are looking at the potential risks of reopening the sites and the required measures to mitigate them, with suggestions that ratepayers may have to book a slot to visit.Police and other statutory bodies, including the Department for Infrastructure, along with neighbouring councils, are also being consulted about reopening the sites.Council officers have suggested the recycling sites will open in a ldquophased manner and that certain restrictions will apply. Discussions with trade union officials are also planned.This Friday, the Northern Ireland Executive will review the current coronavirus regulations which could pave the way for the reopening of recycling centres not just in the local council area, but across Northern Ireland.Local councillors Willie Clarke and Billy Walker say Newry, Mourne and Down Council is right to carefully assess the guidelines published by Mr Poots and proceed with caution.They say the key importance is the safety of staff and residents, with the councillors suggesting that a visit to a civic amenity site would need to be classed as an ldquoessential journey under the current coronavirus legislation.Cllr Clarke says it is vital that the council approaches the reopening issue with caution, given that ldquocoronavirus is still rampant and people are dying.He continued: ldquoAny decision needs to be based on medical advice and direction from the Assembly.ldquoRecycling centres have not been classed as an essential service and people on their way to such a facility could end up getting stopped by police and issued with an enforcement ticket and sent home.ldquoThe council must ensure that all the Trsquos are crossed and the Irsquos dotted before the centres reopen. I understand there is a need across the community for this to happen, but my appeal to people is be patient for just a little longer.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoA phased approach to reopening the centres has been discussed by the party leaders.

A decision also has to be taken on what waste will be accepted at the sites in the short term.ldquoThe last thing we want is everyone landing at the sites, people getting out of their cars talking to one another and maybe not social distancing. People are still dying s a result of the virus and we must keep that in mind.Cllr Walker said that while many people have been cleaning their homes, garages and outhouses during the lockdown, the council needed to ensure that its civic amenity sites can reopen in what he described as a ldquosafe and proper manner.He added: ldquoWe need to manage the reopening process carefully and ensure there are not long queues of people waiting to use the centres, particularly in Downpatrick, Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with tailbacks of cars spilling on to busy main roads.ldquoThe council does not want to put ratepayers at any risk and, in my view, is rightly proceeding with caution. It is not a simple case of opening the entrance gates and letting everyone in.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the decision to close the recycling centres is continually being reviewed in-line with government essential travel restrictions.ldquoThe council is currently reviewing this guidance and the implications it will present when it reopens the centres within the district, the spokesman continued.ldquoIf a decision is made to reopen the centres, residents will be informed via updates on the council website, social media channels and through local media outlets..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Ryan.jpg","title":"Ryan bakes tasty treats for heroic postmen  ","story":"SOME superheroes really donrsquot wear capes ndash they deliver the post.To honour the work of the often unseen heroes of the local postal service Ryan Bogues has delivered a hamper of his famous baked treats to the Royal Mailrsquos Downpatrick sorting office.The  year-old, who has Downrsquos Syndrome and lives in Teconnaught, has has to suspend his popular Ryanrsquos Cookie Box initiative, which he started over four years ago, because of the coronavirus lockdown.Ryan was praised by Prime Minister Boris Johnston last year for fundraising for several charities through his Cookie Box scheme where people donate money for his baked goods.Hersquos helped by his mother, Hazel, who explained a line in a recent speech from Taoiseach Leo Varadkar inspired them to think of local postal workers.ldquoMr Varadkar used the line lsquonot all superheroes wear capesrsquo and that struck a chord with us, she said.ldquoWe have had to close the Cookie box, but Ryan wanted to still help. We have an excellent postwoman and thought that the postal workers were among the very many key workers who were all working really hard to ensure that their service goes on as normal so we felt that they deserved a Ryanrsquos Cookie Box hamper.She added that Ryan bakes enough goods to donate two hampers per week since the lockdown and they have gone to nursing homes, pharmacists and hospitals as well.The hamper, which contained a range of buns, traybakes and lemon drizzle cake was well received by the  men and women who work at the sorting office at the Ballydugan Road Industrial Estate.Manager Donal Carabine received the hamper last week and said it helped lt everyonersquos spirits.ldquoEveryone at the delivery office has been working hard to both work in new ways to ensure everyonersquos safety at work while continuing with our service, said Mr Carabine.ldquoWe are delighted to have been recognised as being amongst key workers by Ryan and his mother and the baked goods are appreciated by all. We thank them for their generosity and I can assure them that the treats didnrsquot last too long.Mr Carabine said that the staff were coping with delivering items, mainly packages, and were as busy as they would be at Christmas mdash the busiest time of the year.ldquoI think the staff are coping admirably with the demand, as well as abiding by the two-metre social distancing rule in work. We have had to reorganise the office and stagger the earlier start times of some staff but they have all risen to the challenge.The Downpatrick office delivers throughout the wider Downpatrick area as far as Seaforde, Ardglass, Crossgar and Saintfield.Mr Carabine said: ldquoThe workers are more than holding their own in terms of maintaining deliveries and keeping themselves safe, although in some areas, due to the need to protect workers, the service is a bit later than usual..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Support.jpg","title":"Saintfield’s Leah battling to raise cash for charity  ","story":"A SAINTFIELD mum is throwing her weight behind a gruelling event to raise money for charity.Leah McCourt, a champion mixed martial arts fighter, is undergoing a test of strength and endurance challenge for Christian Aid, which is responding to the coronavirus crisis in some of the poorest countries in the world.Over five days, -year-old Leah will be attempt to complete , exercises carrying a weighted bag used by combat athletes to build strength.Starting on Monday, Leah will complete the daunting daily task of , squats and lunges while carrying on her shoulders the crescent-shaped lsquoBulgarian bagrsquo filled with  kilos of sand and wool.

He is disappointed at having to postpone his trip, but says itrsquos better to remain in New York.Tommy, who is a treasurer of a global finance company, usually commutes by subway into the heart of the Big Apple each day. However, since the city went into lockdown on March , Tommy has been self-isolating at home with his girlfriend, Lia.The former Crew Road resident has been living in New York since ,after he completed his Masters degree at Queenrsquos University Belfast, and says he only intended staying for six weeks.That same year he flew to Dublin on September  mdash the same day as the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, which he and friends had visited the previous day.ldquoWe had taken pictures with the security guards and other workers and it still haunts me wonderingthose guys were able to make it out alive, he says.Tommy says that  years on fear has ed to the streets of New York.ldquoAt the beginning of the pandemic back in early March our company was swt to respond. We put social distancing measures in place and rotated staff on a sht basis so that only a third of workers were in the office each day.ldquoWe knew the virus was going to get more severe so after we learned the St Patrickrsquos Day parade was to be cancelled we took that as a signal and mandated that all staff should stay at home.Tommy says the sweeping changes have left an eerie feeling in their wake.ldquoIn the first few weeks the only workers that remained in the city centre were builders availing of free movement and the empty streets to get ahead with development projects, but they too were forced to quit, he said.ldquoTraffic has all but ceased, apart from a few ambulances and delivery trucks.ldquoThe economic impact of coronavirus has been devastating, particularly for the Irish who have found themselves furloughed off, out of work and not entitled to any government aid.ldquoA charity has been set up called Slainte  which was formed with the sole intention of alleviating the suffering that many have been going through and to help those less fortunate to get through it.Tommy is also a leading figure in the GAA in New York which is supporting Slainte .At the weekend local Gaelic footballers in the city ran a combined distance of , kilometres, which is the equivalent of running theof Ireland, from Malin Head in Donegal to Mizzen Head in Cork mdash and back.The event was in place of a cancelled Gaelic football tournament and all proceeds went to Slainte .ldquoOver half of the people who have applied for help from Slainte  are in the hospitality industry which looks to be one of the last groups that willto work in all likelihood.ldquoThere is also a lot of great work being done by other Irish community groups in New York.Tommy says it is very encouraging to see the Irish community pull together during a time like this.He said: ldquoThe Irish are renowned for putting their shoulder to the wheel in times of adversity and the last few weeks have been no dferent.ldquoWersquore looking after each other as we always have done when hardship strikes.Tommy says people can still make donations to Slainte  by going to the link www.slainte.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11316808.jpg","title":"children belleek show support","story":"PLEASE NOTEIt is a tough time for our entire community and especially the business community.

There is a transition period where you are not really the Archbishop of Armagh but you want to be as helpful as you can and you are also I suppose trying to work out what and how you are going to approach the task.The Archbishop-Elect explained the three facets to the roleHe said there was the appointment of Bishop of the Diocese of Armagh, which has a larger population with a great number of large towns in it than Clogher Diocese.In addition, there is the role of Primacy of All Ireland, considered lsquoFirst among equalsrsquo acknowledging there is another Primate in the southern province but to some degree to be an ambassador for the Church of Ireland.He added: ldquoThe third element is your place within the wider Anglican Communion which I have relatively little experience of. You become a member of the Primatersquos Meeting which is one of the instruments of communion within Anglicanism. There are a number of ways we hold ourselves together, the Lambeth Conference, the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Anglican Consultative Council and more recently, the Primatersquos Meeting.So what type of church do you see under your leadership ldquoItrsquos dficult to speak for the church as the Church of Ireland General Synod is the body which has that authority. There is a saying that the Church of Ireland is synodically governed and episcopally led. What the Archbishop of Armagh can do is to speak to the Church and suggest can concern itself with. It sets a bit of a tone as well. Itrsquos about its spiritual le and its own governance and the need to acknowledge that like probably all institutions and all bodies some bits of it do well and some do not do well some bits are growing and some bits are shrinking some bitsvery well and some bitsnot so well and to maybe try to discover that the bits that do not do well could do a bit better, in terms of spiritual le and acknowledging there is a huge ersity within Anglicanism and to remember that thatrsquos all part of the Anglican heritage.ldquoThere are obviously particularly challenges at the moment, what the church says to society and what it does for the society in which it is placed. You cannot pretend it doesnrsquot live in a political context. Politics is not something that just happens in Parliament. Democracies are places where political discussion or dialogue are about what we can do together or decisions which are deeply embedded. There are institutions which are recognisable bodies in civil society such as the business community, trade unions, voluntary sector and churches are one of those. I think they have their particular things to say and its perfectly legitimate for them to say it.ldquoThe big imponderable at the moment is coronavirus and we have no idea how deeply that will affect the patterns of society. We could come out the other side of that challenge a changed society, with maybe small changes and maybe some very profound changes. Of course the other big external issue is Brexit which involves the relationships between the dferent regions within Ireland and the United Kingdom.ldquoI could be in both parts of that jurisdiction in one day praying for good governance for both of them and for their leaders, he said.In terms of reaching out to people in the Church of Ireland, the Archbishop-Elect recalled how a Northern Ireland Le and Times survey revealed around  per cent of people in Northern Ireland attend church at some point. He said the heyday for attending church was in the period from the late th Century to the period to the middle of the s. But he thinks current attendance is ldquoback to the old norm with fewer people committed to regular churchgoing.He rightly points out that churches are among the very few inter-generational bodies with people of dferent ages attending.The Archdeacon-Elect says people in very small rural parishes are committed to their churches in the sense that they are contributing to their community who feel it is being enriched with their presence. He said the church finds its place in the community.ldquoThe second challenge is what we are for ourselves as a group, as a faith community, how we build up the church, which canrsquot live in isolation but we have our particular family traditions - how we contribute to the ersity of Ireland, how we build up the church to be confident communities of faith and not hesitant or fearful or invisible communities of faith.He said for the Church of Ireland, there was tremendous heritage from Anglicanism.ldquoThe Church of Ireland has a particular way of doing things, liturgically. Liturgy is both the expression and source of our belief. Our vocation may be to hold together what on the face of it appear to be contradictory things is maybe one of our roles in religious and spiritual le. I have no ideait is the best way to be a Christian but it is our way and it seems to contribute something to the catholic church, the wider church.ldquoHarry McAdoo, a well-known Archbishop of Dublin and a great scholar, once said, lsquoIf I hadnrsquot been born an Anglican, I would have had to become one.rsquoThe Archbishop-Elect leaves Clogher Diocese after forging and maintaining good relations with other denominations.He said: ldquoI think the vast majority of committed Christian people see more in common with other Christian traditions than separating us. There is a very long history of ecumenism in the diocese of Armagh as well. There is a long association and friendship with Archbishop Eamon Martin and I hope we can continue to build relationships and friendships.The Archbishop-Elect trained for Church of Ireland ministry after a career in industry in which he held a senior role in Shorts and was for a time, Assistant Director of the CBI in Northern Ireland.ldquoThat probably give me some skills in organisation and about leadership. Irsquove been very lucky here. Irsquom not very fond of the word lsquoleaderrsquo in the ecclesiastical world but one of the things a leader does is to build a team around him. It is almost a contradiction in terms to be involved in a leadership role in Christianity, to do it on your own.ldquoThere are certain things as a bishop that end with you. There are plenty of lonely moments in that sense where you have to make decisions. But by and large business acclimatised me to working with all sorts of dferent people from all sorts of dferent backgrounds in dferent ways and to experience what every parishioner experiences, normal working le with those pressures.As Bishop of Clogher the new Archbishop-Elect held a number of positions nationally and internationally representing the Church.He was the Church of Ireland contact person to the Churches of the Porvoo Communion which represents the Scandanavian and Baltic Lutherans as well as the Spanish and Portuguese Anglicans and other Anglican churches and provinces from these islands making contact at senior level travelling with them.He has also held senior roles on the Irish Council of Churches, the national ecumenical instrument and also the Irish Inter-Church meeting, the latter which includes the Roman Catholic church.He said those bodies were important especially as ecumenism was becoming bland and it was important to keep going and keep talking.These inter-church bodies contribute to providing resources for churches around Brexit, homelessness, welfare reform and subjects churches would be expected to have a voice in.ldquoI enjoyed that hugely, I am coming to the end of that, six years in total two years as vice-President, two years as President and two years as outgoing Vice President. I will be involved again as a member of the Church Leadersrsquo Meeting.The Archbishop-Elect says of his time in Clogher Diocese ldquoItrsquos always been an aim of mine wherever I have worked to try to create a family atmosphere where there are degrees of mutual respect and degrees of mutual accountability. I remember saying that the diocese of Clogher is big enough to do thingswe all pull together in the same direction and small enough for everybody to be necessary for that to happen and to be accountable for what the contribution is. If you treat people with respect, then relationships are easier.ldquoBy and large I felt people were for me rather than against me. It helpsyou are reasonably interested in people and their families and what they do and acknowledge that as an important factor in their faith. Whoever the next Bishop of Clogher is theyshould allow him or her to be his or her own bishop of Clogher and not that they should be like me, Brian Hannon or Michael Jackson or like St. Macartan.The Archbishop-Elect says he enjoys reading history and poetry and in terms of music, takes particular pleasure in the tradition of Anglican anthems . He does admit to particularly enjoying the Psalms which are poetry.The Archbishop-Elect acknowledges that his mother who had a profound influence on his le, reciting the Daily Office at home and was happily committed to God and His Church and would have sung the Te Deum while washing the dishes. One of her favourite biblical phrases was from the Gospel of St. John, Chapter  ldquoI come that you would have le and that you might have it more abundantly.Relaxation for the Archdeacon-Elect is visiting one of his favourite places, the Ulster Museum to see the collection of Irish Art and reading.ldquoThe thing I am looking to reading most is I took possession of the third volume of Hilary Mantelrsquos Wolf Hall trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, lsquoThe Mirror and Light,rsquo an historical novel, he adds.The Archbishop-Electrsquos we Mary teaches in Enniskillen Royal Grammar School and his daughter, Dorothy, is at the University of Oxford.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.
