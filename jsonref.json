Lake Semlevo in the Smolensk region has been thought to contain Napoleon\u0027s loot ever since the 19th century, but Ryzhkov says this is a fraudAccording to a member of Napoleon\u0027s staff, Philippe-Paul de Ségur, the loot was hidden in Lake Semlevo in the Smolensk region in western Russia.Scottish novelist Sir Walter Scott added further fuel to the rumour when he mentioned the treasure in his 1825 biography, \u0027The Life of Napoleon Bonaparte.\u0027Historians and archaeologists have scoured the area of Lake Semlevo ever since and the legend has been bolstered by huge troves of weapons and ammunition that have been uncovered around the lake.The Russian paper reported that the Soviet\u0027s made extensive efforts to retrieve the treasure in the 1960s and 1970s to no avail.But according to the Moskovskij Komsomolets paper, Vladimir Poryvaev who has hunted the treasure for years says Ryzhkov\u0027s story is absurd.He cited the idea of 400 wagons as particularly outlandish, saying this \u0027secret\u0027 convoy would have stretched for miles.Poryvaev also mocks the idea asking what scuba gear Napoleon\u0027s men had for their complex underwater burial at the the bottom of an icy lake in the middle of winter.Russia searches for Napoleon\u0027s gold - BBC News"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/15/17/4E4757A800000578-0-image-m-35_1531670840554.jpg","title":"Scottish waitress 21 filmed twerking ambulance denies damaging property","story":"    Ms Bell (pictured) has denied causing damage to property A Scottish waitress who allegedly twerked on an ambulance after England\u0027s World Cup quarter-final win over Sweden denied damaging property today.Larissa Bell, 21, is accused of waving her arms in the air as she stood on top of the emergency vehicle near London Bridge station while being cheered on by boozed-up football fans on 7 July.Scott Dennett, 25, Singaporean Perry Kangyue Jian, 26, and James Elton, 27, were allegedly part of the crowd which spilled out into Borough High Street to celebrate the 2-0 victory. The rapid response car was left with a shattered windscreen and dents in its bonnet.Bell, of Glasgow, Dennett, of Thornton-Cleveleys, Lancashire, and Jian, of Poplar, east London, all denied damaging property at Inner London Crown Court. Elton, of West Hampstead, north-west London, is yet to enter a plea to the charge.

Democrats put forth Pelosi and Republicans will nominate Kevin McCarthy, who will serve as GOP minority leader in the 116th Congress. Then the House held a rare roll call vote.Given its size - 435 members - the House uses an electronic system to vote up or down on legislation.But the speaker\u0027s race is one of the few occasions when the clerk calls the names of every member to let them voice their vote. Each member is called inidually, in alphabetical order.Lawmakers can vote for anyone. The Constitution does not require the speaker of the House to actually be a member of the House and some lawmakers vote for an alternative. In 2017, then-Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona voted for civil rights icon and Georgia Rep.

Jared Huffman said of his vote that same year. Lawmakers may also abstain by voting \u0027present.\u0027A majority is required for a win. In 2007, Pelosi and her team worked to make sure she had the unanimous support from Democrats to seal her historic rise as first female speaker of the chamber.  After Democrats won the chamber in the 2018 election - picking up 40 House seats - there was chatter Pelosi may not take the speakership again.But the California Democrat proved her chops as one of the best negotiators and vote counters in Congress by locking up her return to power. She cut a deal with dissident Democrats to gain the speakership but at a price - she will be out of leadership in four years. Protest votes are usually tolerated during the speaker election. Out-and-out betrayals of your party are not.In 2000, the last instance where a lawmaker voted for the other party\u0027s speaker\u0027s candidate, then-Democratic Rep.

Don Young of Alaska.After Pelosi took the oath of office, she will address the chamber to give her vision of leadership.\u0027This House will be for the people,\u0027 she told NBC News, adding Democrats will work to \u0027lower health costs and prescription drugs prices, and protect people with pre-existing conditions to increase paychecks by rebuilding America with green and modern infrastructure – from sea to shining sea to pass HR 1 to restore integrity to government, so that people can have confidence that government works for the public interest, not the special interests.\u0027Then she swore in the rest of the House. The first day of a new Congress takes on a first day of school atmosphere.   Most lawmakers are dressed in their finest. Several bring their families and children are also dressed up, particularly if they want to go on the House floor. The House dress code requires men to wear a jacket and tie.Lawmakers will be reminded there are no photos on the House floor - a rule the younger members may have trouble with. Both members and their staff wore lost looks on Thursday as they tried to figure out the labyrinth system of hallways and tunnels that make of the Capitol complex - the Capitol building itself, three House office buildings and three Senate office buildings with an underground system of tunnels connecting them all.            Members of the freshman class of Congress in November          The chamber of the House was empty as lawmakers prepare to convene the 116th session of Congress          Pelosi has already moved into the speaker\u0027s office and worked out of it this weekNew members received their lawmaker pin Thursday morning - the jewelry item that identifies them as a member of Congress.

Several new members were spotted going into one basement room wearing silver \u0027madame speaker\u0027 pins in support of Pelosi. After the speaker\u0027s vote, members will debate and vote on three measures: a rules package to govern the rules of the House and two resolutions the Democrats proposed to reopen the federal government, which is on day 13 of the partial shutdown. It will be a long first day for the new members. The last votes are expected around 9 p.m.   In between floor debates and voting, members and their families will be able to get their photos taken with Pelosi to commemorate the occasion.  Knife brandished during Mayfair fight that left bouncer deadFinal moments of hero bouncer who fought off gatecrashing mobBottom slap sex assault that landed A$AP Bari in British court\u0027Vase\u0027 smashes over partygoer during New Year brawl at Mayfair propertyNew Year\u0027s Eve row sees man hit woman over the head repeatedlyMan\u0027s failed attempt to kiss a woman on Dutch tvBrooklyn Beckham celebrates New Year\u0027s eve with girlfriend Hana CrossShocking moment huntsman on horseback beats saboteur in OllertonMoment 50-year-old man drives car into New Year crowd in GermanyPolice officers work at Park Lane after New Year\u0027s Eve stabbing"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/09/17/4C03926D00000578-0-image-m-11_1525883193955.jpg","title":"Retired couples plan raffle 500 000 four bed home WRECKED gambling laws","story":"    Robert and Avril Smith (pictured outside their home in North Yorkshire) have been told that they are not allowed to raffle off their property after the Gambling Commission told the couple that their competition was not legal, forcing them to cancel the fundraising effort           The couple have spoken of their regret at having to cancel a fundraiser for Cancer Research after gambling laws intervened to scupper their charity effort (pictured: the interior of the property\u0027s lobby)          The house - which boasts this huge swimming pool - was put on the market by the couple in the hope that Avril Smith could help raise money to fight cancer, a disease that she has battled herself           The couple have been forced to ditch their fundraising plan after the Gambling Commission told them that the raffle was not legal (pictured: the property\u0027s sitting room)Couple whose Down\u0027s syndrome son, six, struggles with stairs...Another reason to celebrate!

They came to the United States in 1995, when she was 12, and they ended up in Minneapolis in 1997.Her election to Congress brought many firsts: the first Somali American and first Muslim refugee elected.

Cummings, a mercurial and intelligent strategist, stoking the fire of Brexit behind the scenes, with Gove, alongside Boris Johnson, as the public face of the official campaign me, doing all I can to dampen the flames and get people to focus elsewhere.Cumberbatch says he took the Cummings role because of James Graham’s script, but there is no doubt that the master strategist behind Brexit also provides a fascinating character for any actor.Witnessing him in action before the referendum campaign, it was clear Cummings was highly effective at being isive. It was he who characterised the educational establishment as ‘the blob’ and wound up anyone and everyone with his vicious, mischievous and — of course — anonymous outpourings on Twitter.At that time, he was clearly behind a series of briefings against David Cameron. So much so that he and Michael Gove were invited into Number 10 and asked if there was anything he wanted to get off his chest.Cummings, it turned out, wasn’t so willing to criticise the Prime Minister to his face, and my memory of the meeting was of him meekly praising Cameron. Afterwards we wondered where the reckless rebel of folklore had been. After all, this was someone who reportedly used to sign himself into Whitehall meetings under the name Osama bin Laden.At the time, my view of Cummings was summed up by quoting that scene from Monty Python’s Life Of Brian, ‘He’s not the Messiah, he’s just a naughty boy’. The line was changed in the TV version to, ‘He’s not the Messiah. He’s just a f****** a*****le’. So how accurate was the rest of the drama?          The charts the story of the clash of political campaigners, with Cummings directing the Leave campaign and Oliver directing the Remain sideFrom the moment the film was announced, critics of Brexit were worried that having an international superstar like Benedict Cumberbatch playing Cummings would give the man more credence than he deserved. They feared Cummings would be lionised, rather than held to account.At first, I worried too. Surely a star of Cumberbatch’s calibre would create sympathy for a man who should be confronted with tough questions.And the fact is that, having delivered the Brexit vote, Cummings disappeared in a puff of smoke. After setting the fire going, he steadfastly avoided media interviews — and refused to appear in front of a Parliamentary committee to answer difficult questions about data use and dodgy claims during his campaign.Most of my fears were allayed, however, when I visited the film set and saw that Cumberbatch was almost unrecognisable, having shaved his head to create Cummings’ unmistakably sparse thatch and bald forehead. He has not glamorised Cummings, just sort of inhabited him.The first half of James Graham’s sophisticated and thoughtful script is devoted to exploring Cummings, the Machiavellian guru who can connect with, and prey on, people’s fears.He is shown running rings around the likes of Brexiter Tory MP Bernard Jenkin, whose cack-handed attempt to get Cummings fired from the official Leave campaign blew up in his face.But if the first half of the film pays heed to Cummings’ undoubted intelligence, and can be seen as the case for his defence, the second is the case for the prosecution.Johnson and Gove are shown at one point looking perplexed and perturbed as Cummings dances manically in front of his notorious campaign red bus on which he had slapped the deeply misleading message: ‘We send the EU £350 million a week. Let’s fund our NHS instead. Vote Leave.’          James Graham, who wrote Brexit : The Uncivil War, said Cumberbatch wanted to play Dominic Cummings with ‘sympathy and understanding’At this point, the Remain campaign comes into sharp focus, trying to defend an unsatisfactory status quo and complex realities, from immigration to the European Court of Justice, in the face of simple claims that Utopia is just around the corner, if only we can leave the dastardly EU.It shows how Cummings sets about systematically and carelessly unleashing the demons of David Cameron’s nightmares.As for the scenes in which I am portrayed, I watched through splayed fingers, groaning as I saw that Rory Kinnear had captured my mannerisms and tics as I tried to have some time with my children while taking a conference call with David Cameron and Peter Mandelson.Kinnear also captured my sense of despair as I watched anti-Brexit campaigner Bob Geldof flicking V signs at Nigel Farage as they barracked each other during their notorious River Thames confrontation at Westminster, when rival pro-Remain and pro-Brexit flotillas clashed. ‘Is this what we’ve come to?’ I asked.The film shows how the murder of the kind, brave and thoughtful Labour MP Jo Cox stopped the campaign short. A moment to reflect about what things are really worth.I suspect how you judge Brexit: The Uncivil War will depend on whether you are Remain, Leave or simply uncertain. It’s extremely well written, acted, directed and produced.If I have one small criticism, it is that the film focuses too much on the exploitation of data as the reason Leave won, suggesting it was simply clinical brilliance that triumphed, rather than the cynical calculation of Cummings and his team, who were too willing to ride in the slipstream of Nigel Farage as he threw out raw, red meat to his supporters with exaggerated and irresponsible claims. It could also have done more to acknowledge that many of the 17.4 million who voted Leave did so out of anger at Brussels’ arrogance and the billions being paid to the EU.The drama is at its best when it shows Dominic Cummings as a master of disruption and destruction, who struggles to make things work long-term.More than two-and-a-half years after the EU referendum, we’re nowhere near the Brexit Utopia he and the Leave campaign promised.          Cummings, pictured here with Boris Johnson and Michael Gove ran the Vote Leave campaignAt the end of the TV version, Dominic and I meet for a drink. He tells me the hard truth that a new type of politics is coming, ‘One that you can’t control’.I ask him, ‘What’s your edge?’ What has he found to make things any better? He doesn’t have an answer.That meeting never happened. But writer James Graham invents it — legitimately in my view — as a means of summing up the clash of two very different world views: Me – believing the world is complex, muddy and requires compromise Cummings the absolutist who demands creative destruction.In that make-believe conversation, I make the case for ‘a kinder, gentler politics’ — and my fear that it has been lost. That’s exactly what I feel having been through the madness, bitterness and bloodshed of the referendum and its aftermath.I hope the film will serve as a warning that the political class needs to sober up - and focus more on what unites, than what ides us. Respect is due on both sides. And it is my belief that the only way through the current chaos is for Parliament to find a cross-party common ground that finally allows us to move on.As for me and Dominic, I’m more than happy to make that drink a reality. Talk it over. Make the peace – and help put out that fire once and for all.So how about it, Dominic? The drink’s on me.Brexit: The Uncivil War is on Channel 4 at 9pm on Monday, January 7."},{"url":null,"title":"Water weird buffalo Huge beast emerges Indian pond","story":"    One of the buffalo covered in algae.  A trio of huge half tonne water buffalo bathing in an algae-covered pond blend in so well a photographer mistook them for rocks          These three 8ft-long water buffalo, captured at Osam Hill in Rajkot, India, swim to cool themselves down and also feed on the floating aquatic plants          Would you recognise these shapes as bathing buffalo?

The great Robert Capa would tell me I’m not getting close enough. Can some intensive coaching help me to raise my game?It’s a Sunday morning and I’m on Rue Mouffetard, a bustling market street in Paris, skulking behind a pyramid of nectarines. My sights are set on a fluffy black poodle nuzzling the ankles of its owner, a stripey-trousered woman of a certain age.Raising my camera to my eye, I risk a few furtive shots but, irritatingly, the poodle keeps scampering out of the frame. Its mistress is engaged in animated banter with a guy tending a rack of roast chickens. Promising. But, spying the camera, he throws his hands in front of his face.This is the trouble with street photography. Like many amateur camera operators, I’m a fan of the genre and the vintage work of stars such as Saul Leiter and Elliott Erwitt. But the logistics are challenging. Since buying my first DSLR a few years ago, I have spent many hours pacing the streets of London in search of inspiration. People tend not to like a total stranger following them around taking photos of them and, as I am acutely aware of this, my compositions are frequently rushed and taken from peculiar angles. Magnum photographer Robert Capa’s adage, “If your photos aren’t good enough, you’re not close enough,” certainly applied to me, but I had no idea how to overcome it.Then, one day, inspiration struck. I was listening to the photography podcast Hit the Streets when I heard its host, Valérie Jardin, mention upcoming workshops in Paris. These sounded like exactly what I needed. Now I’m here, I’m not so sure.“Remember, you’re not doing anything wrong,” Jardin, an energetic Frenchwoman, had told me. “You’re documenting life on the street, which is important. It’s best to start with a busy, touristy area where everyone has a camera. You’ll feel more invisible. Not only is a lot happening, with plenty to catch your eye, but you’ll be more at ease because of the crowd.”The trouble is, that morning I’m not feeling remotely at ease. “If you’re nervous about going in close to people with your camera, photograph dogs – owners are always so proud of them,” Jardin had suggested. “Compliment the dog and then you can work your way up to asking for a photo of its owner, too.” I snap the poodle again. The poodle looks confused. Its owner gives me a look that doesn’t encourage me to ask if she would like to be photographed.We had begun the workshop by going through some of Jardin’s work: highly stylised images of impeccably dressed people with a strong emphasis on dramatic natural light and silhouettes. Within minutes, my creative lethargy dissipated. It hadn’t occurred to me before, but much of contemporary street photography and the way it is taught has a kind of “Gotcha!” sensibility, where the onus is on viewing subjects as victims. Jardin’s beautiful photos, while still obviously “street”, have a different quality. They are photos you might want to hang on your wall rather than expect to see in the pages of a tabloid – a far cry from the in-your-face quality seen in the work of star snappers such as Bruce Gilden, Martin Parr and Dougie Wallace.“I’m more and more resistant to calling myself a street photographer,” Jardin had confided. “I’m recording life’s beautiful moments, ordinary moments that become extraordinary when you freeze them in time. Street photography is one of the most difficult genres to master. You have no control over what other people are going to do, only control over your gear and your vision. There’s a lot of luck involved, but without vision, luck doesn’t matter.”When Jardin takes me on to the streets, the biggest surprise is observing the simplicity of her camera settings. I suppose I had imagined there was some secret shutter-speed formula that would render light beautifully, if only someone would share it with me. In fact, she scarcely bothers with manual mode. Instead, her laser-like attention is on the people around her, and on the light.“I never bring the camera to my eye it’s all done here,” she says, tapping the LCD screen of her black-and-silver Fujifilm X100F. I would never have tried what the experts call “shooting from the hip” if I had been on my own, believing it was beyond me. But my coach is confident I can do it. “The trick is to always shoot at the same focal length in time your eye will know exactly what you’re going to get before you even press the shutter.”Several shots of cobblestones and a dog’s front paws later, I’m getting the hang of it. One thing is for sure: people are a lot less bothered by my presence without a camera at my eye. I sneak a glance at a woman engrossed in Le Journal du Dimanche and press the button. Now that I’ve turned off my camera’s beeps, as suggested, things are a lot easier. I relax and start to have fun. “I like the humour in your work,” declares Jardin, when we review our images. “Keep at it – I think you will get there.” I’m not even sure where “there” is, but I feel 10ft tall.Back home, I resolve to be bolder about the photos I take. But despite following Jardin’s advice to practise a different technique every day (silhouettes one day, panning the next), the discipline quickly becomes aimless and I feel deflated. Why am I doing this?Jardin agrees to give me some Skype coaching. During our first session she says I’m facing a common problem. “If you go aimlessly into town with your camera, you’re just going to get the same bunch of average shots of the same boring thing. What you want is a project that you can do anywhere, even if you’re travelling or the weather is bad.” Jardin has several such projects on the go, including people looking at modern art, beautiful smiles of strangers and hands. “The subject itself doesn’t matter, but it should be something that you’re naturally drawn to, so that you keep going with it.”Suitably inspired, I choose two subject areas that I’m always drawn to: London shoppers and reflections. Jardin books me in for a follow-up session so she can assess what I’ve been up to. I must admit, this accountability in itself makes a huge difference. Just as I am slacking off on the whole thing, up pops a message from her: “How’s the project going?” That is enough to get me moving again.Over the course of a month, I assemble two albums and then narrow them down to five photos each. Some are new, some are images I had previously taken that fitted the theme. This is another thing I learned from Jardin – photography isn’t just about taking photos. You want to create a body of work by editing your images and grouping them together in a meaningful collection. Like a lot of people, I take loads of photos and then do nothing with them.At our final critique session, I must confess that I’m a little nervous. There is a particular mortification associated with presenting a photo to an expert and awaiting feedback. Whatever genre you favour, quite a lot can go awry with an image. Certainly, Jardin is robust in her observations about how each of my shots could be improved and is quick to pick up on recurring technical errors and bad habits. “If you’re going to shoot people from the back, it has to be super-interesting. Far better to run ahead of people and catch them from the front further up the street.” And: “Again, you’ve shown too much detail of the surrounding buildings. I wish you’d gone in closer to your subject. If you can’t bear to do that, then get a longer lens.”But she is also warm-hearted and generous with her praise.“I love, love, love the man outside the shop with the bag. He looks as still as the mannequins in the store. And the Café Rouge one, it’s my favourite. I love the interconnection between the human element and the backdrop. Bus, red building, red coat. That shows you visualised the strongest possible subject and then you were patient.”She even goes so far as to suggest I enter some shots to a photo competition, something I would never have thought about doing. She also puts things into perspective: “You should be really happy to have got so many good shots. Many street photographers believe a strike rate of one in 100 is good going.”Ultimately, having a professional scrutinise both my work and my working methods has been a revelation. It has made me stop dwelling on the skills I lack (such as photographing anything that is moving faster than a snail). Instead, I’ve started to appreciate what is unique about my photos: colour, drama, texture things I would never have noticed on my own.Most significant of all about working with a creative coach is that, because they take you seriously, you start taking yourself seriously. I now print my photos and have produced cards using the images. I’m also going to start a photography foundation course in 2019, something I previously lacked the confidence to pursue. Who knows, I might even start a project about dogs and their owners.Valérie Jardin is the author of Street Photography: Creative Vision Behind the Lens.

In 2016 the library, which is a volunteer-run charity, was threatened with eviction from the building in Southwark where it has been housed for three decades, when the council announced it would begin charging rent – increasing its costs from a £12,000 annual service charge to £30,000 a year.A petition signed by 16,000 people and a “read-in” protest from the public led to a reprieve, but the building is now due for redevelopment, with the library needing to leave the premises in spring 2019.While an alternative space in Peckham was found by Southwark council, the library needed to raise at least £30,000 to finance the move. Almost 800 supporters have now helped it to raise the funds, with library staff now looking for a further £12,000.Fundraising coordinator Magda Oldziejewska said the extra £12,000 would cover additional costs, including archival storage, blackout curtains and painting and decorating. Staff are also looking for volunteers to help sort through a backlog of 4,000 uncatalogued book donations ahead of the move.In 2012, the Women’s Library, an archive of women’s history founded in 1926, was threatened with closure, but was saved when the London School of Economics stepped in to house it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e42c99ca3289e61c97739fc90d876970ec453e41/0_13_2985_1791/master/2985.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b24e10fb1bc43ca0fe91460f2da093f0","title":"tell us how would a no deal brexit impact your business","story":"What issues do you anticipate for your business or sector should the UK leave the EU without a deal?Government ministers released a batch of papers in September warning of the risks of leaving the European Union without a deal.Impact papers stressed some of the day-to-day effects after Theresa May chaired a special meeting of the cabinet focused on how a no-deal outcome could be handled.We would like to hear from you if you work in a sector you think may be affected by a no-deal Brexit and to find out what the potential impact would mean for you.Tell us a little about what you do and how your reading of the situation means your business or sector could be affected in our encrypted form below.

Three days into the year and fat cat bosses have already made what average workers will earn all year. “It’s not fair, and it makes no sense in how we value people’s contribution to society and it makes no sense for the economy – I don’t know any care workers who squirrel their wages away in offshore accounts, they spend it in their local areas and on paying their bills.”Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, also slammed “greedy executives” she said were “taking more than they’ve earned”.“Too much wealth is being hoarded at the top,” she said, adding that reforms were needed to bring executive pay “back down to earth”.Shareholders have also taken aim at overpaid executives, with 63 companies including Royal Mail, Persimmon and Unilever facing investor rebellions over pay last year.“This is a result of shareholders feeling they are not being listened to,” said Andrew Ninian, the Investment Association’s director of stewardship and corporate governance.“Companies need to do more to respond to shareholder concerns and ensure pay rewards align with company performance and remain at levels that are justifiable to shareholders.”A £75m bonus pocketed by the boss of Persimmon, Jeff Fairburn, eventually resulted in his ousting in November following an earlier investor backlash.The CIPD and the High Pay Centre are calling for a major overhaul of how executive pay is set in the UK.The two bodies say corporate remuneration committees, which decide executive pay levels within each company, should be more erse in terms of gender, ethnicity and professional background in order to combat group-think.They are also calling for long-term incentive plans, which tend to dole out performance-based bonuses every three years, to be replaced with a less complex system based on a basic salary and a small restricted share award.Executive performance should also be based on benchmarks including employee wellbeing and workforce training, which the High Pay Centre and CIPD say are “crucial for good corporate governance”.CIPD’s chief executive, Peter Cheese, said: “Excessive pay packages awarded by remuneration committees represent a significant failure in corporate governance and perpetuate the idea of a ‘superstar’ business leader when business is a collective endeavour and reward should be shared more fairly.“This imbalance does nothing to help heal the many social and economic ides facing the country.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b17a22288a3752a25b761e5a5c9fa24946114d3/0_156_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be8120d2e2289277433b4733146c0a75","title":"fiona onasanya mp brexit westminster","story":"The disgraced MP has pledged to carry on despite her conviction. And Westminster is too preoccupied to remove herIt seems a strange thing to say about the disgraced Labour MP for Peterborough, but Fiona Onasanya is a lucky woman. Onasanya was found guilty of conspiring to pervert the course of justice last month. She faces a prison sentence. She is contemplating the ruin of a career that included her public aspiration to become Britain’s first black female prime minister. I’m not sticking my neck out very far to say that this last is not now going to happen.Onasanya’s offence: she repeatedly denied to police that she was behind the wheel when her car was caught speeding in Cambridgeshire in 2017. She refused to say who was driving. In fact it was Onasanya, who is a qualified solicitor as well as an MP. After a first trial failed to agree a verdict, Onasanya was found guilty at the retrial. She will be sentenced soon.Amazingly, Onasanya remains an MP, at least until then. This is the first reason she is lucky. Many of us would have already been fired by now. MPs, however, enjoy some privileges, often rightly (think for a moment about the potential for partisan mischief of a general zero-tolerance statute). So a conviction does not debar someone from being an MP unless they are sentenced to 12 months or more (the result of a law brought in after the IRA hunger-striker Bobby Sands was elected in 1981 while serving 14 years). So Onasanya is entitled to remain until she is sentenced.Yet her determination is unusual. In recent cases in which MPs have faced criminal trials, they have often resigned before trial or sentencing. The Liberal Democrat Chris Huhne, who also lied to police about a speeding offence, resigned as an MP after pleading guilty in 2013. During the expenses crisis, Labour’s David Chaytor, Jim Devine, Margaret Moran, Elliot Morley and Denis MacShane all quit before trial, and Eric Illsley did so before sentence. Conservative Nigel Evans stayed in the Commons while on trial for sexual offences in 2014, of which he was acquitted. Onasanya, convicted, remains.What is more, she is up for a fight. In an unabashed article for the Peterborough  last week, Onasanya wrote that “anyone who has been following the news” would know that politics has recently been busy and fractious over Brexit and welfare reform, and that she was fighting for Peterborough. There was zero acknowledgment that anyone who had been following the news would also know she had been convicted of a serious crime – and no suggestion she had let her electors down. Far from it. Onasanya has now compared herself to Jesus, whose conviction “by the courts of his day” was the start of “the next chapter in his story”.Her messianic defiance hasn’t gone unrebuked. As soon as she was convicted, the Labour party suspended her. Jeremy Corbyn said she was “obviously” not going to stay an MP. Onasanya’s article prompted the paper’s editor to say that, while he felt duty bound to publish her column because she was the local MP, she ought to resign. “She is no longer fit to represent the people of Peterborough,” Mark Edwards wrote. But represent Peterborough she still does. It will be fascinating to see how far she pushes her luck in the Commons when it returns on Monday.Because here’s the second reason Onasanya is lucky. Convicted MPs are actually very rare. No sitting MP has been imprisoned since 1991. That’s not because, as the expenses scandal showed, there have been no miscreants. It’s because, in the past 25 years, a story like hers would have had only one ending. Onasanya would have been driven out of Westminster, probably by the media alone, and also by political and parliamentary ostracism. But not, perhaps, any longer.That’s because Onasanya is a beneficiary of something new – the Brexit obliteration effect. With politics so preoccupied, stories like hers have slipped down the agenda to become merely a sideshow. Neither her peers nor the media have the energy or space to chase her down in the old way. The blanket of Brexit has settled across almost everything in politics, like a deposit of volcanic ash, making traditional politics all but impossible. That same blanket is heaven sent for someone such as Onasanya.Moreover, and let’s face facts here, she is a vote. In a knife-edge hung parliament, every vote matters. Last month, when Theresa May’s leadership was on the line, the Conservative high command quietly took Burton MP Andrew Griffiths and Dover’s Charlie Elphicke back into the fold. They did so because their votes for May mattered more to Tory whips than the claims of inappropriate sexual behaviour, which the MPs deny, that led to their suspensions.Labour has decisively cut its ties with Onasanya. But she still has a vote, and she is a vote for Corbyn’s pro-Brexit stance. That vote would be lost if there was an early byelection in leave-voting, marginal Peterborough, which Onasanya won from the Tories in 2017 by a mere 607 votes. You can see why Labour might be willing to wait. Not even the Tories want a Peterborough byelection right now, especially if Nigel Farage reverses his pledge not to run, turning the contest into a toxic verdict on May’s Brexit. In the end, it may take a recall petition to oust Onasanya.Britain can “turn a corner” and start a new chapter if parliament backs her Brexit deal, said May in her new year’s message. She makes that all sound so simple. Get Brexit sorted and move on. In essence it’s what Corbyn wants too, to get back to “real” politics after this long distraction. But as the Onasanya saga shows, such politics is asphyxiated by Brexit. Post-Brexit politics will be much more like Brexit politics than May and Corbyn think. There will be no quick turning of corners and no tidy new chapters, whatever MPs decide in two weeks’ time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e061b3902ea2f91dcfd31a045af367702b17f62/393_0_5999_3600/master/5999.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c64beb45582b989238df6d6ee365928","title":"southbound capturing the complexities of the us southern states in pictures","story":"Life in the US south is the focus of a major exhibition at the Halsey Institute of Contemporary Art in Charleston.

Artist and designer Yinka Ilori goes in search of galleries, boutiques and hip hangoutsAmsterdam’s always been one of these places friends keep telling me is amazing, while I’ve just nodded and gone: “Yeah, I’ll go there someday.” So it was about time I did. Getting there by Eurostar, without the faff of going to the airport, taking off your jacket and dealing with security makes all the difference. I constantly get inspired by things when I go away, and I’m always bringing back loads of stuff, from trainers to magazines, food and drink, so I love not being hampered by airlines’ weight restrictions. This time, though, I didn’t actually buy that much – I was too busy checking out some incredible places. Here’s my pick of where to go.Be a culture vultureI love photography, and so, it seems, does Amsterdam there are certainly plenty of places that focus on it. Don’t miss Foam, on Keizersgracht. It’s only a small gallery, but it has an impressive collection of work, built up since its opening in 2002, including images by international photographers such as Noémie Goudal, American artist Daniel Gordon, Dutch photographer Viviane Sassen and – a favourite of mine – Brit Juno Calypso. There’s such a good mix of work: black and white, colour, different themes and formats.You almost don’t need to go inside modern art museum Stedelijk its newest wing, unveiled in 2012, looks like a sculpture in itself (or a bathtub, according to some locals). It’s an impressively big, white structure that contrasts with the original, 19th-century building it’s attached to. Venture inside and you’ll find art, design and photography from a lot of people I admire, including Keith Haring, and Arthur Jafa, who’s worked on videos for Jay-Z and Beyonce.Art in the red light district? It exists W139 is an artist-run space on Warmoesstraat. Back when it launched in 1979, you could find anything from painting to spoken-word performances or punk rock, and it’s still got a fairly anarchic vibe today.Wine and dine, Amsterdam styleAmsterdam’s foodie scene isn’t only about great meals there are some awesome interiors too. I really appreciate good bar and restaurant design – it creates an atmosphere of its own, and none more so than at Café-Restaurant de Plantage, a gorgeous greenhouse-like structure in the middle of the city’s beautiful botanic gardens I could see flamingos strutting around outside from my table. The food’s mainly Mediterranean – think handmade ravioli stuffed with fennel sausage, or Spanish fish soup. It’s rightly jammed, and the service is fab and friendly, without being fawning.For a similar feel, try the jade-green-hued Bar Botanique, in the Eastern Docklands, which is hung with plants and bamboo trees, and serves a mighty fine negroni. The Kanarie Club on Bellamyplein is an old tram depot – you can still see tram tracks on the floor – and its vast, industrial space is softened with ropes of lights, and vibrantly painted steel beams. Upstairs, by the bar, is an empty swimming pool, which is a bit bonkers. But I found the way they’ve used the space inspirational it used to be derelict, and home to squatters – but the way they’ve given it a new lease of life echoes what I do, upcycling furniture. Also, they do the best burger I’ve ever had.I was really taken with the ethos of A Beautiful Mess, located a little outside the centre in a former prison. All the food is made by refugees from places such as Afghanistan, Somalia and Syria, and the experience they gain in the kitchen here paves the way to viable careers in hospitality. You’ll get everything from Lebanese flatbreads to chapatis and curry. Also, the interiors are very colourful – which always earns extra points from me.Round off your night with a visit to Hiding in Plain Sight (if you can find it). It’s undercover, like a speakeasy, with a louche feel. The barmen are great, and it feels like a locals’ place a really secret address.Explore new neighbourhoodsYou could spend a whole morning or afternoon checking out the NDSM district, reached by a ferry from near the train station. Formerly home to Amsterdam’s shipyards, it’s been transformed into a buzzing cultural hotspot with bars, cafes and pop-up shops. The IJ-Kantine bar and restaurant is located in the building that once housed the shipyard offices and workers’ canteen, and PLLEK, another hangout on the waterfront, is made out of shipping containers.There’s even a hotel in a crane the Faralda Crane Hotel has three plush suites inside, and you can bungee jump off it, too (I didn’t). This district is one of those places where you can just wander around for ages soaking up the atmosphere, gazing at the street art, having a beer and people-watching for hours. It’s no surprise that festivals and outdoor performances are regularly held here, and once a month there’s a massive flea market.Back over the water, I loved cycling round the charming neighbourhood of Jordaan, to the north-west of the city centre. It’s got a lot of history, including the Anne Frank Museum, and all the culture, food and shopping you could want. Lose yourself in the Nine Streets, a little network of passageways between the canals, crammed with independent homeware, fashion and interiors boutiques, but don’t leave without making a pilgrimage to Winkel 43. Why? Quite simply, it does the best apple pie you’ll ever eat. I had one slice there, and bought another to take home, it was that good.On my return Eurostar to London, I make the most of the journey. Getting inspiration down on paper while it’s fresh is important for my work, so, wherever I go, I’m always drawing and working. When you travel by plane, the lack of space can make that quite stressful, so being able to plug my phone and laptop in – with enough room to work properly – really was the icing on the cake – or perhaps the sugar on the Oliebollen, if we’re being Dutch about it.Getting thereEurostar has a twice-daily direct service from London St Pancras to Rotterdam and Amsterdam Centraal, with prices starting from £35 one way. On the return journey, passengers will need to take a Thalys train from Rotterdam or Amsterdam to Brussels-Midi for security checks, before boarding the Eurostar to London.

The woman on screen was her, but the voice was not hers.“Maybe the film had been dubbed into Italian and then dubbed back into English with another actor. Or maybe they didn’t like my voice and changed it to someone else’s,” she says in a voice of a more seductive, deeper timbre than the one I had heard on film.If Runacre’s voice has been erased, that would be fitting. Michelangelo Antonioni’s The Passenger, which is now being revived in a digitally improved version, is about changing identities. It could have been called The Man Who Mistook Himself for a Corpse. Its protagonist, played by Jack Nicholson, is a TV journalist called David Locke who is covering a civil war in a nameless African republic. He is sick of himself, professionally burned out, and his marriage is on the rocks. Then he sees a way out. He swaps identities with a lookalike man whose body he finds in a hotel room. Little does he know that the man he has become is a rebel gun-runner whom government hitmen want to rub out. He becomes, unwittingly at first, a politically committed freedom fighter rather than the detached observer of a struggle that he was in his previous life.Runacre plays Rachel, Locke’s estranged wife and a fellow journalist, whom we see in London with her lover, played by Steven Berkoff. Rachel and a colleague edit the footage her husband filmed in the desert, looking for clues as to why he died. “I’d just been in a fringe play with Steven called Hot Pants, but this was very different,” Runacre says. “And very different from the Hollywood villains Steven usually played.”Runacre’s role as the estranged wife is key to Antonioni’s film. In flashback, we see Rachel observing her husband as he interviews the republic’s dictator. After the interview, she berates him. “You involve yourself in real situations, but you’ve got no real dialogue. Why didn’t you tell that man …”“… that he’s a liar?” replies David.“I know, but those are the rules.”“I don’t like to see you keep them.”“He’s not true to his ideals. He’s lost his integrity,” explains Runacre over coffee at her flat in Chelsea, London. “He’s become a void, which is why she leaves him.”What does Runacre remember of being directed by Antonioni, the auteur of Blow-Up, L’Avventura and Zabriskie Point, who had a reputation for being difficult for actors to work with?The film is a masterpiece of enigmatic film-making from a virtuoso of silences.“He loathed explanations and cut them wherever possible so the film is almost silent. You’d work not knowing what you were doing. I thought, if he’s unhappy with what I’m doing he will tell me. On set, though, he wouldn’t really talk to you directly, but would often send over another person who would say: ‘The maestro would like you to do this or that.’ How lovely to be called maestro!”And what of Nicholson and Maria Schneider, credited only as the Girl, with whom Locke gallivants around Europe and Africa, all the while pursued by hitmen until the film’s tragic denouement?“It was an unusually quiet performance that Antonioni got out of Jack – very different from those excitable performances he gave in Chinatown, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and The Shining.”Nicholson was accompanied during the 10-week shoot through Algeria, Spain and London by his then-girlfriend Anjelica Huston.“He was notoriously promiscuous and, despite Anjelica being there, flirted with the girls on the set and they with him.” Including her? “No. I wasn’t interested. Instead, I formed a bond with Maria and her girlfriend Joey, an American photographer she was devoted to, and who was treated for psychosis soon after filming finished on The Passenger. Maria hated Hollywood and had had terrible experiences.”Schneider was just 19 when she appeared in Bertolucci’s notorious Last Tango in Paris (1972). “She told me she didn’t know in advance there were going to be nude scenes.” In the film, Marlon Brando’s character, Paul, rapes Schneider’s character, Jeanne, using a stick of butter as lubricant. In a 2007 interview, Schneider said the scene wasn’t in the original script, and that Brando and Bertolucci had told her about it just before they began filming.The director, who died earlier this year, later acknowledged that he had sprung the scene on Schneider at the last minute, because he wanted her onscreen humiliation and rage to be real. “I wanted Maria to feel, not to act,” he said.Runacre says: “She told me that she wasn’t actually buggered but that she was utterly humiliated by the way Bertolucci treated her.”After The Passenger was screened at Cannes in 1975, cast and director rose for the expected applause, only to be booed. “They were booing Maria for her scandalous performance in Last Tango. She got the blame, not Bertolucci.” It was in a sense a second violation.The Passenger didn’t win that year’s Palme d’Or and has gone into relative obscurity since. “One reason for that is that Jack bought the rights to the film and it was little shown.” Why? “Maybe he didn’t like his performance. He should have, though.” Runacre got the role in The Passenger because Antonioni had admired her debut performance in John Cassavetes’ 1970 film Husbands. She was a drama student when she auditioned to play a young English woman with whom Cassavetes’ character has a dalliance while on a trip to London with his pals, played by Peter Falk and Ben Gazzara, when the three of them are going through a collective midlife crisis after the death of a friend.“I got the part, then forgot about it, graduated and went to Scarborough and played in rep – stuff like Agatha Christie and Pinocchio. While I was there, we were all drinking Guinness, so I put on a bit of weight. Then I got the call from Cassavetes saying I’d got the role. I went back to London and Ben Gazzara said to me: ‘You’ve put on weight – better lose it.’ People wouldn’t speak that way now. But I slimmed down very quickly.”She loved working on the film, particularly an early scene of mostly improvised flirtation with Cassavetes. “It was a great introduction to film for me because I had been learning the Stanislavski method and here I was learning something very different from Cassavetes.”Husbands proved such a critical success that Cassavetes advised her to hurry to Hollywood. Why didn’t you go? “I didn’t want Hollywood upending my life – or the humiliations that Maria was exposed to.”Yet, while raising a family in London, Runacre worked with some of cinema’s leading directors. She appeared in Pier Paolo Pasolini’s The Canterbury Tales, Tony Richardson’s Joseph Andrews, Ridley Scott’s The Duellists, Nicolas Roeg’s The Witches, John Huston’s The MacKintosh Man and Derek Jarman’s Jubilee. In the last of these she played both Elizabeth I and Bod, a member of a roaming, murderous gang of anarchists that also included Toyah Willcox and punk icon Jordan.Of those film-makers, who was the biggest monster? “I’ve got no complaints with any of them, apart from Derek. He once shouted at me that I was driving too fast when we drove to Cannes to show Jubilee in 1978. He was right – I did drive too fast, so the car broke down. When we arrived, everything was stolen from our hotel room. And the people at the festival hated our punk gear – they thought we were ugly.” She continues: “I loved working with Derek, because it was all DIY, making our costumes and sets. You’d never get that in Hollywood.”Although she has acted throughout her career, on stage, film and TV (she was, for instance, Brenda Champion in Charles Sturridge’s 80s adaptation of Brideshead Revisited), Runacre reinvented herself as a visual artist in the 90s and later taught performance art in west London. Her installation At Least I’ve Got My Visual Stimulus is a Beckett-like piece featuring Runacre as a woman on stage talking unstoppably (the stimulant is telly), and her performance piece Bring Your Own Barbie involves the artist deconstructing a mannequin that looks a little like her. It is almost as if Runacre is erasing her body double – Antonioni would have appreciated its critique of identity. “You know what I learned from the film? We’re all passengers really.”Runacre, now 72 and elegantly clad in skinny jeans and a boucle jacket, tells me her next role will be in Alexandre Dumas’s The Lady of the Camellias at Waterloo East theatre in London in March.Does she wish she had become a Hollywood star? “Well, I certainly didn’t, did I? None of my films has gone on general release. Every one of them went straight to art houses. Not that I mind. I was in fringe theatre and then I had kids and then I got into making art. I’ve loved that life, and I still do.”• The Passenger is re-released on 4 January."},{"url":null,"title":"spiky superheroes far out sci fi and endless live action remakes a 2019 fanboy preview","story":"The Joker’s failed standup career and M Night Shyamalan’s Unbreakable conclusion provide some gnarly eccentricity in a year dominated by Disney deja vu and Hollywood rebootsIs the superhero flick entering its postmodern phase? Can Star Wars get superfans back onside? Is Will Smith still a bona fide A-list Hollywood titan? And will there really be an appetite for three Disney live action remakes in a single year? These are some of the posers that 2019 stands ready to answer, so let’s dig right in to Week in geek’s annual all-action preview of the big-screen hotties and notties for the 12 months ahead.For all those complaining that they cannot peep their head inside a multiplex without being accosted by musclebound hunks with magical abilities, things are unlikely to get much better in 2019. The Marvel big guns will roll out in April’s Avengers: Endgame, March’s Captain Marvel and July’s Spider-Man: Far from Home. The first will reveal how the world puts itself back together after Thanos’s climactic finger snap in last year’s Avengers: Infinity War, and the latter two take place before and after the big purple meanie destroyed half the galaxy’s intelligent life forms. Meanwhile, the main movie from Warner Bros-owned DC this year will be the ostensibly kid-friendly Shazam!, about a skinny teenager who is given the power to identify obscure pop music tracks transform into a hulking costumed crime fighter simply by uttering the name of the hokey golden age hero.However, the year ahead does offer up the tantalising prospect of film-makers reworking the superhero genre into new and more intriguing forms. Might the comic book movie be entering its “acid western” period?Take October’s Joker, which will exist outside the main DC Extended Universe. With more than a nod to Martin Scorsese’s classic mean-minded 1982 satire The King of Comedy (as well as Alan Moore’s graphic novel The Killing Joke), Todd Phillips’s origin story stars Joaquin Phoenix as the crown prince of Gotham, recasting the DC staple as a failed standup comedian who embarks on a life of crime. With a budget of just $55m and no prospect of this new Joker being shoehorned into encounters with other DC stalwarts, the project has the welcome air of a production unhampered by commercial concerns. Of course, if it breaks all box office records, expect the DCEU to be immediately repositioned around this version of Batman’s arch-nemesis, with the unfortunate Jared Leto unceremoniously jettisoned to a parallel comic book universe.Over at Twentieth Century Fox, still clinging on to its X-Men-tinted corner of the Marvel universe (at least until the studio completes its merger with Disney) the year’s main focus will no doubt be June’s Dark Phoenix. And yet August’s The New Mutants, from The Fault in Our Stars director Josh Boone, looks a whole lot more interesting. Centring on four young people with nascent powers who have been trapped in a mysterious facility by unknown forces, it stars bright young things Anya Taylor-Joy (The Witch) and Maisie Williams (Game of Thrones), and might mark a welcome shift for the superhero genre into full-on horror territory.Tipped to step even further over the line into gnarly eccentricity are M Night Shyamalan’s Glass (out later this month), the third instalment of a trilogy that began with 2000’s Unbreakable and continued with 2016’s Split, and Brightburn, which looks like a twisted blend of Superman and The Omen. The former will see Samuel L Jackson’s Mr Glass encountering the many kidney-curdling personalities of James McAvoy’s Kevin Wendell Crumb, while Bruce Willis’s David Dunn wrings his supposedly invincible fingers in angst. The latter sees Elizabeth Banks as a Martha Kent figure who rescues an all-powerful space baby from a fallen interstellar craft, only to discover her new ward is not the (Kryptonian) messiah, but a very naughty boy indeed.It looks like 2019 will most definitely be the year of Disney deja vu. Not content with rinsing the opening to the original Lion King for the live action remake’s trailer, the mouse house is also bringing back Dumbo (March) and Aladdin (May), using the wonder of new technology. Perhaps most intriguing here will be the prospect of noting whether the latter’s director, Guy Ritchie, can finally move on from his past, or whether the new Aladdin will emerge as a lovable cockney urchin with super slo-mo fight skills. Perhaps Will Smith, who plays the genie, will grant the film-maker’s wish for a hit after the disappointing double whammy of 2015’s The Man From UNCLE and 2017’s King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.The enduring high quality of CGI-led animated fantasy continues to astound, more than two decades after Pixar gave us Toy Story. Many fans felt that 2010’s Toy Story 3 brought the much-loved story to a suitable finish as Andy headed off to college and the toys escaped the fiery furnace for a new life with cheery toddler Bonnie. But here they are once again in the Josh Cooley-directed fourth instalment (June), featuring the uncomfortable-in-his-own-plastic-skin Forky (Tony Hale) as a new addition to the gang.Before that, in February, The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part will return us to the world of super-sarcastic playthings as Chris Pratt’s Emmet Brickowski is forced once again from his comfortably awesome existence to rescue Elizabeth Banks’s Wyldstyle from the clutches of a nutty intergalactic invader named General Sweet Mayhem. Finally, next month’s How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World will bring the adventures of Jay Baruchel’s high-flying Hiccup to a rip-roaring close. The viking chieftain and his girlfriend Astrid (America Ferrera) are forced to hunt out the titular dragon homeland after coming up against a powerful new enemy, while his trusty steed Toothless finally gets his own love interest.Robert Rodriguez’s cyberpunk Alita: Battle Angel (February) is the movie James Cameron was so desperate to make, for so many years, that he eventually dumped it on somebody else. Rosa Salazar’s big-eyed Alita just looks downright weird in the trailers, and it remains to be seen whether an effect that works perfectly well in anime settles down over the course of the movie or just gives everyone watching a headache.Another Cameron cast-off of sorts is the so-far-untitled Terminator reboot that’s due to arrive naked and glistening around November time.

This alone should be worth the price of admission, providing the powers that be can avoid any madcap Terminator Genisys-style last-minute plot twists.

Meanwhile, Smith has jumped ship to October’s Gemini Man, which has the inimitable Ang Lee in charge – though don’t forget that the Taiwanese … ahem … director of The Hulk boasts somewhat average form when it comes to genre fare. Given this one is about an ageing assassin who comes up against a younger version of himself, the one-time Hollywood top dog’s aides will presumably be hoping against hope that nobody remembers Looper.Finally, December sees the final instalment in the new Star Wars trilogy hit cinemas. Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker returns (again) after copping it last time (presumably as some kind of Force ghost), while we’ll get to see if Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren can recover from his ignominious failure to spot Skywalker’s cheap conjuring trick at the Battle of Crait.

The tiny tropical Australian territory was only settled a century ago, when phosphate, deposited as guano by seabirds, was mined by Chinese and Malay labourers. Its latest industry, however, was the controversial “offshore processing” of refugees. For the past 17 years, asylum seekers reaching Australia’s shores by boat have been dispatched to island detention centres and detained there indefinitely.Brady’s arrival on holiday gave her friend, Poh Lin Lee, a break from her difficult job on Christmas Island, providing therapy for traumatised detainees. “We spent two weeks enjoying this beautiful environment – ing with dolphins, looking for whale sharks, going to really remote beaches,” remembers Brady, who now lives in Berlin. “At the end, Poh said: ‘I need to show you something.’” They slashed their way through dense jungle with machetes (“everywhere you go on Christmas Island, you need a machete”) to reach a lookout. Below spread the grey buildings of the huge camp for refugees. “It was just truly shocking,” says Brady. “I’d seen that image so many times in the Australian media, but I’d forgotten it existed.”This revelatory mix of horror and beauty – and Lee’s growing reservations about her job – drove Brady to return to the island five times over the next four years, making her powerful, discombobulating debut feature, Island of the Hungry Ghosts. Instead of a familiar focus on the life stories of traumatised refugees, Brady’s film is a lyrical, dream-like journey into darkness. It offers no contextual information via voiceover or even captions instead, the camera lingers on brooding rainforest, the spooky dinosaur-like rattle of tropical birds, and the extraordinary migrating land crabs (whose respectful treatment by the island authorities contrasts with that of the human arrivals).The film’s core is Lee’s life and therapeutic work as one of four counsellors employed by Australia’s department of health at the island hospital. The film started small, she says, when she and Brady decided they wanted to secretly document detainees’ stories. Brady met them inside Lee’s consulting room, unbeknown to the guards posted outside the door, and gauged their willingness to be filmed. Although by agreeing they risked punishment or being transferred to other island camps, “there was huge interest,” says Brady. “I was meeting people who had been there for four or five years. There was a huge sense of desperation.”It was dangerous for Lee as well, with the Australian government having introduced a draconian law threatening whistleblowers with two years’ imprisonment. Lee took the chance. “It was far more important to document the stories at that stage,” she says, by phone from Nice, where she now lives with her French husband and two children. “The risk I faced was nowhere near what the asylum seekers risked.”In therapy with Lee, refugees from Afghanistan, Somalia and elsewhere discuss their treatment in detention, rather than the conflicts they have fled – a deliberate decision to avoid re-traumatising them. She worries about the impact on them of being constantly asked to retell their “trauma story”. “When I discussed these concerns with Gabrielle we realised it wasn’t the kind of storytelling we wanted to invite. We offered therapeutic work and if something came out that would contribute to the film, that was secondary.”In fact, Brady ended up filming more extensively only once some asylum seekers had been transferred to the Australian mainland. She and Lee felt their subjects could offer fully informed consent once they had access to legal advice, unmonitored emails and more personal freedom. These scenes, Brady insists, are not re-enactments but a continuation of Lee’s therapeutic work. “At times we were filming in retrospect but the moment itself, particularly the therapy sessions, are very genuine. I haven’t touched them as a director. It worked creatively and it was the only way to have done it with real permission,” she says.The film also follows Lee into intimate corners of her family life as she struggles with her participation in the system that is abusing them. Family camping trips in Christmas Island’s national park look idyllic but are suffused with foreboding. How did Lee experience life in such a strange place? “When we first went there, it was quite sparkly and enticing. I’ve never swum on coral reefs that are completely undamaged. As we were there longer and started to realise that none of the Chinese or Malay community would leave the village area after dark, then we understood more about the history. There was this new layer of heaviness. At the end, I had a sense that the island holds so many lost, wandering spirits.”The film’s digressions into island folklore frustrated one critic, who labelled it “an all-too-pretty but information-deficient documentary”. Audiences with no knowledge of the well-established cruelty of Australia’s refugee policy – condemned by the UN and Amnesty International but with widespread support in Australia, and maintained by all main political parties – will not learn many facts from the film.But Brady wanted not merely to show her audience the refugee story she wanted them to feel it. The film’s opacity and slow pace throw viewers into a state of uncertainty that mirrors – very mildly, of course – the plight of incarcerated refugees. “I wanted to dislocate the audience – you don’t know where you are until a certain point in the film,” she says. “Cinema is like a trip that you are taken on. I wanted it to be a sensorial experience. That’s what implants something inside you – not information and context.”It was hard to sell this vision. Brady worked for four years unpaid, living in a caravan in Berlin. “It was difficult to pitch the project avoiding this box that it would be a refugee film – an information-driven exposé. It was hard for people to grapple with.” She only received a small amount of funding in Australia – from Screen Territory – and eventually funded the film in Europe and also produced a more informative short film for the ). Both Brady and Lee give the impression of being exiles from their home country. “Australia is a politically suffocated place at the moment,” says Brady. “I don’t feel welcome.”The Christmas Island detention centre was quietly closed last October. Since filming, one refugee has published a book of poetry and others are training to be dentists and lawyers nevertheless, all but one of more than 20 detainees who appear in the film remain in limbo on temporary visas, unsure if they will be allowed a future in Australia. Brady made an Australian edit concealing their faces because she fears they could still be “persecuted” by authorities. Setting aside the abuse, both Brady and Lee view indefinite detention as a disastrous own-goal for Australia. “I was meeting people at the top of their game – incredibly smart, multilingual,” says Brady. “These would be the sorts of people you would want in your country.”Lee, who now works with refugees in European countries including Turkey and Greece, is sure the system worsens trauma. “People process and recover by re-engaging in life, relationships, hopes and dreams. When people arrived on Christmas Island, they had come from unspeakable horror, but they were alive and engaged. Had they been welcomed into a community and given opportunities to work, we wouldn’t see these intensive ongoing effects of trauma. We’re creating a whole community of people who will be dependent on mental health services for the rest of their lives.”• Island of the Hungry Ghosts is released on 11 Januaryu"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26c975e61ffee9d2ce951618a65ebf4dd8b568a1/0_0_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c0a89524e7b66aae677848ec1be1091","title":"leeks tomatoes cheese sauce recipe nick deverell smith","story":"A vegetarian comfort food that makes the most of in-season British leeksThis is a really simple and comforting dish to make when you have had a busy day at work and only have a few things in the fridge.

Here are the best wraps, salads, sushi and moreFrom Spam Appreciation Week in March to June’s National Fudge Day and Sourdough September, every day of the year seems to have an (often baffling) link to a foodstuff. On the  food desk, we take this with a pinch of salt – and not just on National Salt Awareness Week (from 29 February) – lest your year in recipes and food articles becomes subsumed by commercial partnerships.But Veganuary, the movement encouraging us to try cutting out animal protein and produce for the first month of the year (in the hope that we’ll keep it up), feels a bit less silly. If adopted by enough people, veganism presents a viable way to offset environmental damage. It hit the mainstream in 2018, with conscious cooks and eaters embracing meat, fish, dairy and egg alternatives – from jackfruit to pulses – in their thousands. The Vegan Society says the UK’s vegan contingent has grown fourfold in just four years, from 150,000 in 2014 to over 600,000 now, while last year Waitrose became the first supermarket to have a dedicated vegan section in 134 of its stores.Going vegan does, however, demand a level of organisation and planning – and Veganuary is no exception. Where can you buy cashew cheese? What are the non-vegan ingredients everyone forgets about? Who writes the best (and easiest) vegan recipes? And, if you aren’t cooking and need a speedy feed al desko, where can you find the best vegan lunch to go? To answer that last question, I ate a dozen lunches from outlets near the office, and here’s what I found …It may be hard to balls up a hummus wrap, but I do think this one is pretty good for the price – it hits the spot, ranking low on imagination, but higher on palatability. The vegan chilli is very good – in spite of my objection to the side-soup format (taking more than half the price of the full-size option from customers for what seems like less than half the volume), and despite my hankering for an unvegan dollop of sour cream on top of it.45Sushi has an unfair advantage over other lunch options: douse with enough soy sauce, wasabi and ginger, and it always tastes good. This is as true of the vegan stuff as it is of fish, so I enjoyed this spread of rice, seaweed, vegetable and tofu concoctions, in spite of the whole premise of “takeaway sushi” somehow seeming wrong (given it is traditionally defined by the care, attention and precision with which it is made).45A paltry boxful of autumn and winter hues, this is tasty, but not one for the hungry. It has four components, of which the kale and lentil salad is the high point. The curried squash is nice, the hummus fine (you can’t go wrong), but there are two dried-up falafel-brown orbs of vegetal dust. I’m generally very keen on Leon’s vegan offering, but this isn’t their strongest option.35Soft tacos need to be heated to stop them falling apart. These had a split second on the grill before being loaded with a dead weight of loveless roasted veg and guacamole, and seasoned with bitter disappointment (but no salt). At £6.30, this is at the dearer end of the spectrum, and that’s not including the (vegan) cereal bar I had to buy afterwards to cheer myself up.15A generous box of orzo in tomato sauce, peppered with tired roasted veg and some arbitrary spinach leaves. This comes with an abundance of very sweet dressing which imparts flavour to something that would otherwise be bland – but it’s far too sugary. I sense the boxed pasta salad might have had its time there’s something outdated about this – which perhaps says all you need to know about Eat, really.15So good. Leon manages to make its vegan boxes delicious and desirable in their own right – quite a feat. These beans, seasoned with hot smoked sweet paprika (the spice used in chorizo) have a “meatiness” and are served over brown rice for a result that is wholesome, filling and satisfying. For the price, you won’t find a better vegan feed.55A better Mexican than Benito’s Hat, ticking the vital boxes that lunch should tick: tasty, sustaining and affordable. The wheat tortilla is made of pumpkin, which, though doughy, has a little more chutzpah on the taste front than wheat wraps usually do. Filled with black bean paste, cumin roasted butternut squash, chipotle salsa, spinach and coriander, it tastes freshly made and has plenty of flavour. Might be interesting to try the filling with a corn tortilla, though, for something gluten-free as well as vegan.45Has the visual appeal of a molehill, but is better in the mouth. The red lentil hummus needs seasoning, but I like the fact that this is filling and has lots of different textures, colours and flavours to keep me interested. I’m disappointed by the packaging, which I’d expect to feel a little more sustainable.35I had to have some jackfruit at some point – it was the darling ingredient for vegans in 2018, and is said to be a plant-based answer to pulled pork. I thought this was delicious, but it needed the addition of zingy guacamole and crunchy coleslaw at the till – to accompany the sweetness of sweet potato mash and the spicy jackfruit curry. The ingredients are, however, largely cheap, so I would say this is £1 too expensive.45I like the M\u0026ampS two-for-£4 deal – a bargain. I’m less impressed by the packaging – which not only sounds my eco alarm bells, but makes the food look so much less appealing. The Thai flavours in the salad (ginger and soy) are quite simply delicious, while the “meh” Mexican rice (I have decided all Mexican lunches need to come with extra lime for some zing) at least offers up the bulk I need. I was surprised not more of M\u0026ampS’s options were vegan they could do with a couple more.45I’m a big fan of Gail’s and this feels fresh, hearty and good for me, with lashings of roasted cabbage and pecan pesto dressing. I think it’s a bit underseasoned and could do with a more generous dollop of the pesto, on which it relies for its character. Were it not a vegan number, they would probably have thrown some crumbled feta over, but given the plant-based straitjacket, they need to make up for the flavour deficit.45We eat with our eyes as well as our palates, and I find it difficult to see past this bowlful’s lack of visual appeal, with its limp assembly of veg and herbs – another example of plastic packaging really not helping the dish out. But it’s worth doffing our caps to Tesco for having a relatively extensive line of affordable vegan lunch options, created for them by Wicked Kitchen. My rainbow curry bowl is full of flavour, with curried lentils and chickpeas, (slightly soggy) onion bhajis, mango cubes and minty dressing – but I wouldn’t go so far as to say the simply roasted sweet potato is “tandoori style”.25"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4558a49726f7e710e6e8e50487cbe8f23a726056/21_108_2950_1770/master/2950.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7bd9296d060e8e58a9f772125a8f662","title":"manchester city liverpool premier league match report","story":"It was the night Manchester City made it clear they have no intentions of relinquishing their grip, finger by finger, on the Premier League trophy.Pep Guardiola and his players will cling to the belief that this victory could be a decisive blow and, at the very least, it has clipped back Liverpool when they were threatening to pull away.If City were to prolong the argument, it was imperative they found a way past the leaders. Even a draw would have felt like a grievous setback for the reigning champions and, when Roberto Firmino nodded in Liverpool’s equaliser, approaching the midway point of the second half, a lesser side than City could conceivably have wilted under the pressure.Not this team, though. As the song goes, City fight to the end and it was not just their competitive courage to conjure up a decisive goal, courtesy of Leroy Sané, that delivered a message. It was the spirit of togetherness displayed by Guardiola’s players in that nerve-shredding finale when Liverpool started pumping balls into the penalty area.On one hand City have not kept a clean sheet during their past 11 fixtures. On the other it was a show of collective defiance during those fraught moments when Liverpool had Virgil van Dijk operating as an extra centre-forward. City gave everything to defend their lead, in the way that true champions do. They dug in, they formed an impenetrable blue line and, when it needed the ugly stuff, they were happy to oblige. In the process they made it clear to their opponents it is going to be one hell of a battle between now and the end of the season.For Liverpool the priority must be not to wallow in self-pity. It is, after all, only a month ago that City were five points clear and looking capable of turning the title race into a procession. Liverpool still have a four-point cushion and, if they need encouragement, there is only one other club in history who has reached the new year unbeaten and not gone on to win the league – and that was Sheffield United in the 1899-1900 season.Liverpool will, however, reflect that the night could have taken a very different complexion but for an astonishing goalline clearance from John Stones. And Jürgen Klopp should be aggrieved that, having made it 1-1, his players left themselves so stretched when Sané collected Raheem Sterling’s pass and fizzed a diagonal shot past Alisson to score via the far post.Perhaps Liverpool might have been better to employ more restraint once Andrew Robertson, the game’s outstanding performer, had turned Trent Alexander-Arnold’s long cross into the six-yard box for Firmino to equalise with a stooping header. It is difficult to be too critical after such an absorbing game but Liverpool lost their shape at the key moment and Sané punished them with a brilliantly angled finish.Klopp also made the point that, with the game goal-less, Vincent Kompany was fortunate to be shown only a yellow card for a scything challenge on Mohamed Salah.City certainly rode their luck at times and never more so than when Salah played Sadio Mané through the middle, the shot thudded off the post and for a split-second, as Stones’s first attempt to clear the danger came back off Ederson and started looping towards an exposed net it felt as if the entire stadium held its breath, anticipating an own goal.The technology showed nine-tenths of the ball had crossed the goal-line – but not the final tenth. Stones had somehow got back to hook the ball away, brilliantly, from beneath his crossbar and City were spared by a matter of millimetres.When Liverpool watch the replays they will barely comprehend how Stones’s final swing of the ball missed Salah, from point-blank range, when even the merest of touches would have resulted in a goal. City made the most of their fortune and, when Sergio Agüero put them into the lead, five minutes before half-time, it was a reminder that the truly great strikers tend to save their best for the big occasions.Bernardo Silva did the build-up work on the left and for the first time Agüero had manoeuvred a yard for himself inside the penalty area. He was still left with an acute angle, shooting left to right, with an outstanding goalkeeper to beat in the shape of Alisson. Agüero had nicked the ball in front of Dejan Lovren but still had his opponent in close proximity.It was the kind of shooting opportunity, on the half-turn, that many strikers would have passed up, concluding that the chances of scoring were too remote. His finish was a beauty – swivelling on the spot and connecting with power and precision. The ball was still rising as it soared between Alisson and his near post and City had the breakthrough they craved.That goal continued Agüero’s record of having scored on all seven occasions he has faced Liverpool in league fixtures at this stadium. More importantly, it gave the home team an element of control when, until that point, Liverpool had seldom looked in trouble. Robertson had been coping with Sterling, Alexander-Arnold had the speed and agility to match Sané and, until that piece of brilliance from Agüero, it was unusual to see City finding it so difficult to create chances.Equally, the same could be said of Liverpool for most of the game and, if City’s supporters had any apprehension about seeing Danilo and Aymeric Laporte operating as their team’s full-backs, it was gone by the end.Liverpool’s 20-match unbeaten run was over and, for City, the title race had opened up with new possibilities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35e39e5cb415fe14fde35306c391190bbf9d7fb3/256_379_5024_3015/master/5024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=828839f218659a7196cfa972237f0f6a","title":"mauricio pochettino champions league cup job tottenham","story":"• Winning FA Cup or Carabao Cup not No 1 for Spurs manager• Tottenham at League Two Tranmere on Friday nightMauricio Pochettino believes he would have been sacked by now at Tottenham if all he had done was to win a domestic cup. The manager takes his team to League Two Tranmere in the FA Cup on Friday while he also has them in the Carabao Cup semi-finals, where they face Chelsea.Pochettino has never hidden where the domestic knockouts rank on his list of priorities and they are some way behind the Premier League and Champions League. It is his ambition to win one or both and to his mind being able to compete is of a higher value to the club and its standing than to win the FA Cup or Carabao Cup – even if he would love to do that.Pochettino has yet to win a trophy in his managerial career and it is a stick with which he is sometimes beaten. He sets greater store by his three top-three Premier League finishes with Spurs and the accompanying Champions League qualifications.“My ambition is to win the Champions League with Tottenham or the Premier League. That’s what puts you in a different level.”Pochettino will weigh up whether to use Harry Kane as a starter or substitute at Tranmere but he has promised to field a strong lineup notwithstanding Tuesday’s Carabao Cup semi-final, first leg against Chelsea at Wembley.Pochettino has made it clear the club must offload players this month if they are to have the funds to refresh the squad as they contend with the costs of their new stadium. They will listen to offers for at least five players – Victor Wanyama, Mousa Dembélé, Fernando Llorente, Georges-Kévin N’Koudou and Vincent Janssen.Wanyama has disappeared off the radar this season because of a serious knee problem. He last played in the win at Crystal Palace on 10 November and Pochettino’s assistant, Jesús Pérez, said: “We will see probably in two weeks if he is ready to start to train.”Dembélé and Llorente are out of contract in June, with the former interested in a move to China or the Middle East and the latter linked with a return to Athletic Bilbao. Spurs are keen to remove Llorente’s wages from the books. It has emerged he takes home £100,000 a week, Spurs having had to pay a premium to take him from Swansea in 2017 ahead of Chelsea.Pochettino said: “It doesn’t just depend on us to regenerate the squad. In case we don’t sell players, it’s impossible to bring players in and to find the capacity to bring players in.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27374ac02205ff3476c24a53dc168641eb61dc9c/0_0_4535_2721/master/4535.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc5778f975b394dc2ae1ca19b8236120","title":"plate of dog raise game speaking italian juventus","story":"Signing for Juventus was among the personal highlights of 2018, a year that saw progress on many fronts but not racismThe turn of the year left behind 12 months to remember personally on and off the field but also from a wider perspective in football.On the pitch if I could summarise 2018 in one word it would be progress. Progress for the England men’s team who, perhaps unexpectedly, reached the semi-finals of the World Cup. They continued that momentum by qualifying for the Nations League finals beating top nations such as Spain with the exciting, fearless brand of football we have all been craving to see from England. I was fortunate to be at many of England’s games in Russia working for ITV, which again exemplified the progress within the media working as a female pundit at the men’s World Cup. We now see so many female footballers contributing their opinions on men’s football on a weekly basis to the extent it is becoming normal. Long may that continue in 2019.I then progressed to Juventus in May last year and Cristiano Ronaldo followed! The transition has been all that I expected and more. There are big differences in terms of fitness days, rest and recovery, nutrition and technical adaptation that have all helped me to develop further as a player, which is what having a new experience is all about – getting better. I have had a few embarrassing moments with the language, including asking for a plate of dog at a team dinner which was met with hysterics, but I aim to be able to give a post-match interview in Italian by the end of the season. So the pressure is on.It was fantastic to end the year scoring a hat-trick and finish with nine goals and six assists in 11 league games. If someone had told me that would be my goal return so soon into my time at Juventus, I would have definitely taken it. I guess when you see Ronaldo hitting the ground running with the 10 plus goals, I can only be inspired to do the same. I hope to continue this form with some silverware to show for it at the end of the season.Unfortunately I cannot say the same in terms of progression for other areas of the game such as racism. We saw specific incidents in 2018 that instead demonstrated regression. Whether it was a banana skin thrown at Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, racial abuse hurled at Raheem Sterling or the targeting of Sterling by sections of the media, I think 2018 was a wake-up call for the game. We need to do more and be even firmer to eradicate racism. However, on a positive note, there seems to be much more openness in discussing how to deal with this problem.Racism is a part of life and it is naive to think it is going to be eradicated. Here in Italy the year ended with monkey chants aimed at the Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly during the match against Internazionale on Boxing Day. As Carlo Ancelotti requested, the game should have been stopped and the referee should have taken more control of the situation in the same way he would do if there was a bad tackle. If a player has been affected by racist chanting, then it is up to the officials to stop the game and make sure a message is read out to the supporters asking them to stop. Most clubs say they will not tolerate any forms of discrimination – that cannot be something that is just said. It needs to be acted on.In 2019, if such incidents happen again, I am more concerned about the punishments. I liked the immediate action that will have a direct impact on Inter by closing part of the stadium for two matches. I would also like to see points docked or entire stadiums being closed if it continues. I believe clubs will start doing something only when it really has an effect in terms of points. If they are deducted three points when they are trying to win the title, then they might take it more seriously. Many will say the punishment handed out to Inter was not enough but once upon a time nothing happened at all, so at least there has been progress. Hopefully fans will see that shouting racist abuse has a negative effect on their team and that will stop them doing it.We are only six months away from the Women’s World Cup in France. It is amazing how once the year starts it all seems that much closer. After such a positive World Cup for the men in Russia I hope the same can carry on to the women’s team, although they are in a slightly different position, given the women have reached back-to-back World Cup semi-finals and have bigger expectations. In terms of the world rankings and the previous tournaments I think the expectation will certainly be for England to win it because we have the level of experience to make that happen. Now the draw has been made I think it is important England start the year keen to build momentum in the friendlies leading into the tournament.In the Premier League we see Liverpool in pole position in the title race. I mentioned at the beginning of the season that Liverpool would be the challengers to Manchester City after the former’s fantastic Champions League run last season. Jürgen Klopp has shown how great a manager he is by building such an exciting team with a defensive core in Virgil van Dijk that has been unshakeable. Finishing 2018 unbeaten is no mean feat but we have all seen Liverpool falter in the title race towards the end of the season when it really mattered, such as in 2014. I do not believe the same will happen this season and this could finally be the year to end the long wait for the Premier League trophy at Anfield."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/078b1f1b26217f61cd1bc245439d9d67723b4a47/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a952397e2454d4933c70355408846cf","title":"fa cup third round 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"A trip back to 1953 at Bloomfield Road, tricky ties for Fulham and Leicester, and plenty of minnows with eyes on a big scalpThe story of the 1953 Charity Shield wasn’t too dissimilar from the story of the 1953 FA Cup final. Stan Mortensen was on target for Blackpool, but his teammate Stanley Matthews ran off with the man-of-the-match plaudits. Yet the tale wasn’t an exact facsimile: despite the heroic efforts of the two Stans, Cup winners Blackpool lost the Shield to league champions Arsenal. The veteran Tommy Lawton was on the scoresheet for the Gunners that day, and, pass that crowbar please, the modern-day Arsenal have similar star strikers on which to call: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Alexandre Lacazette, the increasingly impressive Alex Iwobi. Setting aside Aubameyang’s inexplicable hoick over the bar from a yard out at Anfield, and Arsenal’s continued travails at the back – no clean sheet in six – whoever gets the nod up front for the visitors should decisively make hay against hosts who have lost four of their last six and shipped two goals against non-league Solihull Moors in the last round. Will the Unai Emery era begin with FA Cup No 14? Or can the Seasiders reprise their recent performance at the Emirates in the League Cup – when they were a linesman’s flag away from completing a two-goal comeback – and give the Gunners something to worry about? SMIn the weeks after Tranmere won promotion back to the Football League, having already lost top scorer Andy Cook to Walsall, the fear was that the burden on James Norwood would be too great. But after scoring the winner at Wembley in May, Norwood has relished his role as Rovers’ go-to man, scoring 18 since August, propelling his side to within touching distance of the play-offs. The worry for Tranmere now is losing Norwood, with the 28-year-old out of contract this summer. Norwood has the perfect opportunity to impress suitors higher up the ladder on Friday evening, with an audition against a likely experimental Spurs back line under the lights at Prenton Park. “Big evenings like Tottenham will go a long way to seeing us keep moving forward,” said manager Micky Mellon. “We’ve seen some dark times and hit rock bottom.” BF“I don’t see the fuss about it, we’re going to turn up here, get absolutely smashed and I’m going to go home and get on with my life again,” said Alan Dowson, the Woking manager, in an interview last week. Maybe the magic of the Cup is lost on Dowson, or moreover perhaps it is just a touch of mind games, an attempt to relax his players before facing Premier League opposition. Woking, second in the National League South, are the lowest-ranked team left and warmed up for Javi Gracia’s Watford with a 3-0 win over Hampton and Richmond on Tuesday. Greg Luer, the former Hull youngster, hit a hat-trick in that game, while Ben Gerring, an October arrival, captained Truro City to the first round last season. Five leagues may separate the teams but, after sending Swindon packing in the last round, Woking, whose assistant manager is the Sky Sports commentator Martin Tyler, may just quietly fancy their chances of another upset against a team that are almost certain to make wholesale changes. BFIpswich Town’s recent FA Cup record is staggeringly bad. They last advanced to the fourth round in 2009-10 and have since lost eight consecutive third-round ties. Anchored to the bottom of the Championship, 10 points from safety and with two wins to their name all season, there is little to suggest they will stop the rot against Accrington Stanley, who are just 12 places below Saturday’s visitors in the league standings. While maintaining Ipswich’s Championship status is manager Paul Lambert’s priority, he told reporters at his pre-match press conference he would travel to Accrington “as strong as I can”. Even so, Stanley manager John Coleman is unlikely to be fazed but has conceded his own team haven’t been playing too well either. “We are like Jekyll and Hyde at the moment, not in our performances but in our results, so this is an opportunity for us to get back on track,” he said, before pointing out that funds generated by a 2003-04 Cup run helped get Stanley into the Football League. Advancing to the fourth round for only the third time since the collapse of the original Stanley in 1966 could land them a similarly lucrative jackpot. BGThese two have quite the FA Cup pedigree. They’ve won it six times apiece, a total only bested in history by Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea, Tottenham, Liverpool and Aston Villa. Only problem is, all the good work was done an awfully long time ago. Newcastle lifted their sixth FA Cup in 1955, while Blackburn completed their collection in 1928, having won their other five in the 19th century. So No 7 is well overdue. More recent results – just three wins between them since the start of December – suggests the long wait is likely to go on, whoever prevails. But history can be a blessing as well as a burden: Newcastle beat Blackburn on their way to the 1910 and 1952 FA Cups, while Rovers saw off the Toon during their one successful 20th-century run. The winners are therefore permitted to brazenly ignore the current form-book and take a firm clutch of the good old Comforting Straws Of Precedence. They feel real nice, don’t they. SMNewport County saw off Welsh rivals Wrexham in emphatic style to earn themselves a plum home tie and the welcome windfall that comes with it being shown live on the BBC. In last season’s fourth round, Tottenham’s players clearly didn’t fancy the conditions on a cold January night at Rodney Parade and were extremely lucky to escape with a draw before winning the replay in the more familiar surroundings of Wembley. Given their current Jekyll and Hyde status there’s every chance Leicester could come a cropper, but Michael Flynn’s side will need to up their game considerably, having won just three of their past 15 games in League Two. BGMichael Jolley worked as a corporate bond trader for six years, in London and New York, but ultimately did not find life in banking fulfilling. Born in Sheffield and educated at Cambridge University, when he returned to England to pursue a career in football he volunteered in Crystal Palace’s academy as he embarked on earning his coaching badges while working in the city part-time. On Saturday Jolley will return to Selhurst Park as manager of Grimsby Town, more than a decade on from helping the likes of Sean Scannell, John Bostock and Victor Moses graduate through the ranks. Jolley is working with a palette of different youngsters these days, with Harry Clifton and Elliot Embleton, the Sunderland loanee and England Under-20 international impressing this season. Grimsby will arrive full of confidence, having hoisted themselves up to mid-table in League Two after four wins from their last five. BFHaving seen off non-League outfits Hampton \u0026amp Richmond and Maidstone United in the preceding rounds, Oldham Athletic will have the chance to slay a top-flight side when they travel to a Fulham team currently preoccupied with Premier League survival. Claudio Ranieri’s side should still be too good for an outfit currently sitting in mid-table three isions below, but having knocked Liverpool out as a League One side six years ago, the Latics will fancy their chances. Currently without a manager after club legend Frankie Bunn was controversially dismissed on the back of a 6-0 Boxing Day defeat at the hands of Carlisle, Oldham are on something of a roll under caretaker Pete Wild, who has masterminded back-to-back wins against Port Vale and Notts County. An outsider in the betting to become the next manager, should he do the same against Premier League opposition he could surely stake a legitimate claim for being given the job full time.

At a frantic, slightly wild Etihad Stadium Manchester City defibrillated their own hopes of retaining the title with a 2-1 defeat of Liverpool that was by turns fearful, fretful and often funny.That they did so owed much to their fighting spirit, a little more to good fortune and even more to Sergio Agüero, the blue-grey rinse at the front of this team who played for 45 minutes like the only City player not afraid of the moment, still cold and cool in the middle of all that fury – of which there was quite a lot.No doubt there will be some talk now of City learning to win ugly. Incorrectly so. City did not win ugly here. They won very ugly. They also won slapstick, won zany and won thanks to something close to a pastiche of backs-to-the wall defending, coming on towards the end like a team of senior nuclear particle physicists caught up in an increasingly convincing bare-knuckle street brawl.Finally one could almost hear the voices from the fringes muttering, as City’s ball-players experimented with the idea of shanking wild-eyed clearances into the crowd, as they punted the poor old beleaguered ball forward, as the back four lined up to head clear of their own six-yard box like a £900m Tony Pulis tribute project, and as Bernardo Silva, a man born to glide and twirl and address the ball with his own feather-quilled left foot, careered about the place like a city-centre nightclub bouncer on New Year’s Eve. Finally they have worked out how to play some proper football.And yet for all the energy this was also a victory born out of precision and out of a moment of stillness from City’s most understated leader.The images of victory will be rooted elsewhere. Vincent Kompany was at times a cartoon of chest-heaving full-body defence, although he might also have been sent off for an excessively forceful lunge through Mohamed Salah. At the end, as City’s players left the pitch, a teenage fan came haring through the lines to plead for a selfie with the captain and one half expected Kompany to take him out with a headlock- slamming two-footed Bruce Lee neck-lunge.Beyond this there was Agüero, who came out to fight at the start when the rest of his teammates were cowed, and who produced the one real moment of precision in a fearful first half. Sometimes it really is about the inch in front of your face. Or at least, that inch in front of Dejan Lovren inside the penalty area, with the ball falling out of the sky, the goal at a narrow angle, and 52,000 people drawing half a breath.City had struggled in the opening 40 minutes. Jürgen Klopp had gone with his most muscular midfield, that Milner-Henderson fulcrum, the footballing equivalent of a four-course all-you-can eat carvery roast dinner with boiled and mashed potatoes, all washed down with a two litre jug of extra thick custard.It was a concussive, bruising affair in those early exchanges. Fernandinho ran through the back of Sadio Mané. Virgil van Dijk clobbered Agüero. Fernandinho expanded his range by forearm-clubbing Andy Robertson in the neck. On his touchline Pep Guardiola whirled his arms and crouched like a downhill skier, performing elaborate windscreen-wiper gestures, punching buttons, as though trying to draw his players closer together in front of him.There was something missing from City in those moments. One could feel it stalking the pitch, an absence, something just out of sight. City had come without their swagger, more timid in the early minutes than they have been at any time in the last year and a half.And Liverpool really should have scored on 17 minutes. How they did not will perhaps be the subject one day of a 38-volume Warren Report style investigation that still leaves room for conspiracy theories and mass paranoia. Somehow John Stones cleared on the line just as the ball seemed to have already bulged the net, Mané having rolled it on to the post from Salah’s beautifully nudged pass. Inches, again.It was Agüero who led City through this, a beacon of certainty from the front, dropping so deep he was upended a couple of times in his own half, taking the ball and turning in half spaces. He touched the ball 20 times in the first half, scarcely wasted a pass and moved with a kind of affronted aristocratic grace through the hesitancy behind him.When the moment came he was ready. City pressed down the left. Bernardo Silva crossed from the touchline. Agüero stole in front of Lovren, took a touch and pirouetted towards goal. He did not look up as the ball dropped out of the lights, had already noted, logged and plotted the small pocket of space just past Alisson’s right ear, into which he ked the ball with such sweetness it bulged along the roof of the net, rippling it out in cinematic fashion.The goal did settle City, although Roberto Firmino’s second-half equaliser was deserved and beautifully worked by Liverpool. City still had enough left to take the lead again, Leroy Sané’s shot skimming across Alisson into the far corner. And for all the fight and fury and grappling towards the end it was that moment of calm from their own enduring cutting edge that made the difference."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11ef75592c0d0b1fae30a6f442930603f7f178ec/7_200_3254_1953/master/3254.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=468d311d9c84b917966bbf9a7597bee9","title":"manchester city v liverpool premier league live","story":"Manchester City moved four points behind Liverpool at the top of the league thanks to goals from Sergio Agüero and Leroy SanéThat’s all from me. It’s been a thrilling night. Manchester City have gone four points behind Liverpool at the top of the league and the title race is fascinatingly poised. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye!Jurgen Klopp speaks! “It was big pressure on the game. Very intense and we were unlucky in our finishing moments. A bit more unlucky than City. That was one of the main differences They had periods where they dominated but we came back and had big chances. We had Mo with a big save from Ederson and Gini from a set-piece. You have to score in those moments. If you think of the goal Aguero scored there is no angle. Nice goal. In a similar situation we didn’t score. But everyone can see why we have the points we have. We made it really difficult. I’ve said to the boys it’s completely okay. We could have drawn, we could have won. We lost but it is not the biggest problem. I really like Vincent Kompany. But how on earth is that not a red card? He is the last man and if he hits Mo more he is out for the season. He knows Mo is that quick so he takes the risk. I don’t know if the ref saw it. I saw it, after the game especially. We carry on. I think we can play better.”Pep Guardiola speaks! “The boxes made the difference. We were outstanding from the first minute. I am happy to reduce our gap against Liverpool and come back to second position. Everything is open. We don’t have a left-back. We have Zinchenko but I didn’t want to put this young guy under pressure against Salah. It was not easy for Laporte. But they fought for everybody. Fernandinho, Sergio, Bernardo. We need Sergio in these games. He has special quality in these positions. He has done it all his career. His finish was incredible. They had the first clear chance. We were unlucky. But after we played real good. We scored two and created more. It is important we showed courage. I apologise for what happened with the fourth official. If we had lost today it was almost done. It would have been so difficult. But we cannot forget we are four points behind them and they are the leaders. But this gives us a lot of confidence. Fernandinho is back. We have played a lot without key players. It is not easy for us. Now rest. Then the FA Cup. Then go game by game.”It’s still in Liverpool’s hands, so it’s interesting to look at their fixtures. Potential stick games? They have West Ham, Manchester United and Everton away on 4 February, 24 February and 2 March. They also still have to host Tottenham and Chelsea. But they’ll fancy themselves in most of their home games and have away games against five sides in the current bottom half.One of the most satisfying things for Manchester City tonight is how strong they were without the ball. It’s an underrated part of their game. This was a real grind and they worked so hard out of possession. Liverpool were rarely allowed to develop any flow in attack. Their front three weren’t allowed to click.John Stones is asked about his part in Ederson’s near calamity in the first half. “I tried to just take everything to be honest,” the Manchester City defender says. “I’ve heard it was quite tight. I’m just happy it didn’t go over the line. It’s one of those things where the keeper’s shouting and the defender wants to clear it. I tried to take him and the ball and it’s come back off him. I just reacted quickly.”Vincent Kompany speaks! “I’m not even worried about the result. I’m buzzing with a tremendous performance. We went toe to toe with a very aggressive and physical team and matched them. It’s still in Liverpool’s hands. But we are a better team when we play with emotions.” The defender’s asked about his foul on Mohamed Salah in the first half. “I thought it was a great challenge. Was it not? Oh. I got the ball, a bit of the man. It wasn’t naughty, I didn’t try to injure him.”Here’s Daniel Taylor’s report from the Etihad Stadium.Hopefully this is the start of a memorable race to the finishing line. Neutrals won’t want to see Liverpool collapse after their first setback of the season. They shouldn’t kick themselves too much. It was a game of fine margins and Manchester City, who looked very nervy at times, just edged it thanks to those snappy strikes from Sergio Aguero and Leroy Sane. I’m not sure this was elite City this evening. They were very intense and their rigid back four worked well, but they didn’t really spend 90 minutes slicing Liverpool open. In fact Liverpool often looked comfortable in the first half, only to let Aguero in shortly before half-time, and there was nothing to suggest Sane’s winner was on the way after Roberto Firmino’s equaliser. Jurgen Klopp will want to focus on the positives and stress that his team had chances to snatch an equaliser. City, however, will reckon they’re over the hump now.Liverpool, of course, remain top but Manchester City have cut their lead to four points thanks to Leroy Sane’s winner. Third-placed Tottenham are six points behind.Blue Moon blares out across the Etihad Stadium. A bewildered Jurgen Klopp walks on to the pitch to console his beaten players. Liverpool can’t believe they’ve lost this one. Manchester City’s fans are savouring every moment. Klopp walks over to applaud the away end. He’s wearing a grim expression. He knows his team were very close to killing off City’s title hopes tonight. Momentum is back with the champions now, though.90 min+6: We are past the allotted five minutes. There’s barely any time left.90 min+5: Ederson’s booked for timewasting at a goal-kick.90 min+4: Ederson charges from his line to punch a long ball clear. Moments later Aguero tries to catch Alisson off his line from inside his own half! He does not score. He does not get close.90 min+3: Alexander-Arnold makes to the byline after poor defending from Sane but Danilo cuts out his cross.90 min+2: Liverpool are camped in City’s half now. Van Dijk has gone forward!90 min: City waste two chances to seal it! Lovren fails to control Shaqiri’s pass inside his own area and Bernardo Silva nips in. He runs through but Alisson stands tall and makes a fine save from the midfielder’s thumping effort. The rebound comes back to Sterling, who lashes a shot through the bodies and wide of the right post! Five added minutes.89 min: Bernardo Silva has been booked for a foul on Fabinho.88 min: City make their final change. Nicolas Otamendi replaces Vincent Kompany.86 min: Daniel Sturridge replaces Gini Wijnaldum. Kyle Walker is on for Aymeric Laporte. This is incredibly tense and dramatic now. City are fretting.85 min: From the resulting corner, City are all at sea! Ederson flaps and Wijnaldum - I think - almost forces the ball over the line at the far post! Somehow it’s cleared and whipped away from Van Dijk. City survive. Just.84 min: With City screaming for a foul on Fernandinho by Firmino, Liverpool attack. The ball’s played through for Salah, who has the better of Stones. The Egyptian shoots low from the left, aiming for the far corner, but Ederson pushes it wide! Guardiola goes mad on the touchline. He roars at the fourth official and chucks his scarf on the floor! Anthony Taylor runs over to have a word.82 min: City counter, Sterling surging past a tiring Robertson and racing into Liverpool’s half. Sterling slips a pass through to Aguero, who’s in the clear, with only Alisson to beat. He tries to skip to the goalkeeper’s right and looks to have done the hard part. But just when it seems Aguero’s going to roll the ball home and kill Liverpool off, Alisson es bravely at his feet and concedes a corner!81 min: Head tennis in the City area! Alexander-Arnold turns the ball across goal and Kompany heads into the air. Liverpool try to force a chance, but City stand firm.80 min: Sane breaks down the left, skips inside and finds Sterling, who can’t make up his mind, allowing Robertson to tackle him.79 min: City haven’t really been tested since restoring their lead. We’re still waiting for the second Liverpool wave."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e935c1353b42558b429efc80a1f4de6a1719ced6/0_159_6720_4031/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d02b28932f1aabce23ee53309163cac2","title":"experts urge egypt to rethink two is enough population strategy","story":"Medics say limiting families s not the answer for a country where a baby is born every 15 secondsIn the cramped office of New Cairo hospital’s family planning clinic, Safah Hosny sets a box overflowing with contraceptives next to the visitors’ ledger on a small desk.There are eight condoms for one Egyptian pound, about 4p, or ampoules of injectable birth control, for just under 9p. A contraceptive implant lasting three years costs 22p, while copper IEDs – the most popular form of birth control on offer according to Dr Hosny – cost 17p.The low prices, far less than in any Egyptian pharmacy, are due to subsidies provided by Egypt’s health ministry, as clinics like Dr Hosny’s are on the frontline of Egypt’s battle against an exploding birthrate. A government programme called “two is enough” has been launched to encourage people to limit family size. From this month, the prime minister, Mostafa Madbouly recently announced, the government will cease to provide financial support to a family after their second child.The five-year, $19m (£15m) programme comprises a poster campaign as well as growing a network of mobile and fixed family planning clinics across Egypt. Posters covering the walls of Egypt’s metro show an Egyptian 50-pound note, worth about £2.20, torn into five. “Would you rather ide this into five, or into two?” it asks.But the price and availability of contraceptives at clinics like that in New Cairo hospital belie a wider issue: that Egypt has a long way to go in persuading its people.Hosny says the clinic is happy to serve unmarried women. “For unmarried women I suggest the pill or injections,” she says, pulling out a slide of contraceptive pills.Yet “two is enough” risks failing to target the things that could make a real difference when families, particularly those from Egypt’s working class, are deciding to have children. The campaign will increase sex education for some medical professionals, but will not begin a programme of sex education in schools, currently non-existent. It also ignores options for women with unwanted pregnancies, with abortion seen as a legal grey area in Egypt.“I think it has to be multi-disciplinary thing,” says Dr Hussein S Gohar, an obstetrician and gynaecologist at the Yosri Gohar hospital in Cairo. “You have to start in schools to educate young kids about sex education, contraception and the hazards for themselves, as well as the future of the population explosion. Then they have to target people about to get married, and married people. But if you’re going to make legislation punishing them for a third child, then you have to provide an exit route for them, by allowing medical termination or even abortion clinics.”The heart of the problem, according to Gohar, means thinking about what motivates people to have large families in Egypt. “You need to change the mentality of the people and how they see things rather than just telling them what to do,” he said. “You can’t just go to people once every few months and say the population is too large and there’s not enough water so you need to have a smaller family.”The Egyptian government’s best efforts may also fail to reach more conservative doctors in rural areas, who are more likely to convey the message to patients that every child is a blessing, or to limit information about contraception. “The fact is that in every country, the government can’t cover the entire spectrum,” says Dr Natalia Kanem, head of the UN Population Fund, which has partnered with Egyptian ministries for the “two is enough” campaign. “Private providers can misinform, or even perform so-called medical female genital mutilation. Our job is to flood real information here to counter the myths.”“When girls are left behind, half the population is left behind.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fce514f18cba9cd8ca73bbd35cca49d1c73f2c7/2_0_2283_1370/master/2283.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de66c1640a9835e9cd5edbcf8b62e1ec","title":"louis ck kevin spacey out in wilderness keep them there","story":"In case anyone has forgotten what makes this twosome so gruesome, up they pop to remind usWhatever happened to the wilderness? People used to stay there for ages. Did it turn out to be a really inhospitable place or something?I think we all have to ask as the huge caravan of men returning from #MeToo exile threatens to overwhelm us. Over the past week, it has been difficult to turn on the internet without seeing reports detailing this alleged crimewave’s progress. “My life is over,” declaimed comedian Louis CK to … hang on, where are my reading glasses? … a sold-out audience in Long Island. He owns a multi-million dollar estate on nearby Shelter Island, so I guess it feels as wastelandy a spot as any to unleash a set shitting all over school shooting survivors and people asking to be referred to by pronouns of their choice. But we’ll come to the courage of this material shortly.For now, join the huddled masses, Mr CK! I’m afraid the marketplace of men returning from the wilderness is now so crowded that you have to do something really quite special to get people’s unided attention.Leave it to acting’s Kevin Spacey, then, who dropped a Christmas video that is a work of quite eye-popping WTF-ery. Even by Kevin’s own standards of scenery-chewing, this one’s a real masticator. Top line? He still seems to be in the dark as to how his plot has resolved. What can one say? Other than: I don’t know if you’ve seen the movie, mate, but it turns out it was you all along.As it goes, that isn’t the particular role in his canon on which Kevin overtly draws for this video. Instead, he gets himself up as House of Cards villain Frank Underwood, albeit a Frank Underwood standing behind a kitchen counter in a Father Christmas apron.Other details? You can see why Kevin opted to stand next to a massive turkey – a massive ham would have been too self-parodic – but it does all fade into the background once he starts speaking. “I know what you want,” he begins boldly. “Oh sure, they may have tried to separate us, but what we have is too strong, too powerful … I shocked you with my honesty … but mostly I challenged you and made you think … So we’re not done, no matter what anyone says. I know what you want. You want me back …” On and on he rambles. “Soon enough, you will know the whole truth … Now that I think of it, you never actually saw me die, did you?”I’m watching it right now, Kevin.As for as the secondary import of Spacey’s message, I would say it is the most perfect representation I have ever seen of the space beyond CAA representation. Ditched by the agency last year, Kevin is now operating in a place so far from talent management that the Chinese are decades off being able to land a probe on it.Yet he is still given to reticence when it suits. Spacey is due to appear in court in Massachusetts next week, charged with sexually assaulting an 18-year-old man in a bar in 2016. But a few days after the video dropped, his lawyer argued that Spacey appearing in person would only “amplify the negative publicity already generated in connection with this case”. Though the judge didn’t actually use the words “I think your client’s kitchen psycho video already did that”, he did throw the request out, so perhaps the Santa apron will get a more formal outing next Tuesday.However he plays it, then, Spacey’s performance is already a real credit to his most recent alma mater, the Meadows clinic in Arizona, where you may recall his fellow patients included Harvey Weinstein. The Meadows offers a $2,000-a-night wilderness-type experience, being in the actual wilderness, but without requiring the sacrifice of comforts such as a kale menu or steam room.Both Harvey and Kevin are now back home, so both are … cured, is it? … of the illness they were being treated for. Well done, the Meadows! I hope this clinical success has spurred the creation of a dedicated programme for guys wrongly accused of multiple sexual assaults. I know the very last thing you care about is money, but it doesn’t hurt that this is easily the fastest-growing entertainer demographic. Furthermore, I hope all your other paying patients who had to sit in group-therapy sessions with these two realise how lucky they were to share a treatment journey with some of the earliest identified sufferers of this illness – so new it has yet to be given a name. Does it even have a working title, or are you still listing it as Untitled Sexual Abuse Addiction Project?And so to Louis CK, whose bootlegged set suggested he is so angry at what he did to his life that he can only express it as anger toward people who wish to be known by different pronouns. I expect the next stage of his journey will be sophisticatedly demanding why something is transgressive when he says it, but not when it is said by, say, one of the women he forced to watch him masturbate in a locked room.I’m sure we hate to disappoint this self-styled groundbreaker, but this is all very old hat. Jim Davidson was crusading against comic injustice way back in the 1980s. “‘Well, Billy Connolly swears,’” he recently recalled saying to his BBC bosses. “The producers at the BBC said: ‘A Billy Connolly swear word is different to a Jim Davidson swear word,’ so there you go. Maybe it’s the Scottish accent.” Yes. Well, I’m sure if it was going to be the fault of anything, it would be that Billy came from a different country from Jim. Still, they gave him a very good living for a couple of decades. And Jim’s failure to accept that his time had passed gave him the next two decades of material.Listening to Louis CK’s set, I was struck how much he reminded me of post-BBC Davidson, a man whose act strayed into such unfunny shithousery that it frequently drew complaints even from audience members who’d paid to see a Jim Davidson gig. And so with Louis CK. Not laughing is presented as an imaginative failure on the audience’s part. It reminds us that there is a special, roped-off VIP area of Woke for guys who have been accused of sexual misconduct. They can see worlds you can’t! They are here to reveal their mysteries to you! THEY ARE STILL YOUR SPIRIT ANIMAL, OK? Catch up.As far as much of the rest of the act goes – pronouns, black guys having big dicks – this stuff really is the equivalent of mother-in-law material. It is one of the more embarrassing ironies of the age that everyone who utters the phrase “But you can’t say that any more” has, quite literally, just said the thing you can’t say.One of my biggest and most doomed wishes for 2019 is for comedians to stop acting like it’s crusadingly dangerous to say things that are basically indistinguishable from Jim Davidson’s 1977 Seaside Special act – and then not just wondering why they don’t get campus bookings, but claiming that comedy is being “killed”.Comedy is not being killed. You can still say the things you can’t say. It is 31 years since Allan Bloom wrote his pearl-clutching book The Closing of the American Mind: How Higher Education Has Failed Democracy and Impoverished the Souls of Today’s Students. It is 27 years since New York magazine ran its landmark article suggesting that the thought police were recreating 1930s Germany.Since then, what has really changed? Students are still being mild idiots on campus, but it was ever thus. We’ve known students are idiots since way back. Shakespeare even wrote one of his top four tragedies about it. But you know, unless they homicidally avenge their fathers, sparking a chain of events that basically wipes out a generation of Denmark’s ruling family, they usually get over it.I wish rich comedians would. Apart from students, who surely can’t believe the attention they’re paid, the only other people wetting their pants about all this bollocks are rightwingers who profit financially or electorally from making it a bogeyman. Look at the results. People who can see it works have been banging this drum for almost four decades now, and – SPOILERS – they keep winning. Four decades of seeing snowflakes everywhere has not closed the American mind. TURN ON THE TELLY. The American mind remains so yawningly, chasmically open that it has literally elected Donald Trump as its president. I don’t want to close the American mind after the horse has been made consul but CHRIST, can we try some new material, please?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e55712c45134fd45b17d6be8dcce167c878ad833/0_0_4466_2681/master/4466.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42e5a2b47823b23bde24b98e39b76887","title":"culture fascination with the dark side of the moon","story":"From Pink Floyd’s mental hell to the secret lair of space Nazis, artists have striven unceasingly to sketch the side of the moon China’s Chang’e 4 just reached ‘I’ll see you on the dark side of the moon.” These could easily have been the words of the Chinese team behind Chang’e 4, shortly before it set off on its successful journey to the moon’s far side. But as any rock fan will tell you, they were immortalised 45 years ago at the end of Pink Floyd’s track Brain Damage. It was the line that gave their most famous album, The Dark Side of the Moon, its title. And it remains one of the most enduring phrases in popular culture – copied, spoofed and riffed on by generations to come (even Krusty the Clown has a “lost” album entitled Dark Side of the Moonpie).It’s not hard to see why artists have a fascination with the moon’s far side. It speaks of the unknowable, the distant and the elusive – and is especially ripe for metaphor. For Pink Floyd, the moon’s dark side was used to symbolise the darker forces of human nature on an album that delved into unusual territories for pop: mental illness, mortality and the scars of the second world war. As songwriter Roger Waters explained in the 1994 book Bricks in the Wall: “The line ‘I’ll see you on the dark side of the moon’ is me speaking to the listener, saying, ‘I know you have these bad feelings and impulses because I do too, and one of the ways I can make direct contact with you is to share with you the fact that I feel bad sometimes.’”Other songwriters have seen the moon’s most distant territory differently. For English folk singer Vin Garbutt, it helped describe the conditions of the 1982 Falklands war, where soldiers died in such cold and bloodied conditions it “may as well have been the dark side of the moon”. Rapper Lil Wayne’s 2018 duet with Nicki Minaj envisaged it more romantically, as a place of escape from a postapocalyptic Earth: he arranged to meet up with Minaj on the dark side of the moon, asking her to “leave a message in the dust just for me” when she reached the safe haven. Given that he also offered to take her for a walk once she got there “as she wears slippers”, you suspect their lovestruck escape mission might ultimately have been doomed by insufficient technical preparation.Outside music, the sheer remoteness of the moon’s furthest side has been seized on as a plot device. In the film Iron Sky, the defeated Nazis fled to the moon after the second world war to rebuild their forces – with the plan to ultimately conquer Earth using a space fleet. A crowdfunded sequel is due to be released this month. In Jed Mercurio’s 2007 novel Ascent, a Soviet astronaut successfully lands on the far side of the moon during a secret mission, only to be abandoned there alone when his craft breaks down and the USSR denies any such attempt took place.But for many people, the moon’s dark side will only ever be associated with Pink Floyd. On 4 January, the UK’s National Space Centre in Leicester is putting on the first of two sold-out light and laser shows in its Sir Patrick Moore Planetarium, combining the band’s music with the story of the 1968 Apollo 8 mission, which orbited the moon and made the crew the first humans to see the moon’s other side.“While Pink Floyd titled The Dark Side of the Moon, as an allusion to lunacy, rather than astronomy, the links between the band and the Apollo space programme can be seen in their work,” says Josh Barker, the space centre’s planetarium coordinator and education presenter. “Pink Floyd played a major part in the heady days of the 1960s and 70s, creating innovative sounds that captured the feelings of optimism and freedom that set out the era as something really very special.”The timing of the shows with the Chang’e 4 landing may be coincidental, but nevertheless they neatly summarise the way the moon’s furthest reaches have fascinated scientists and artists alike.Bringing things back down to Earth for a moment, it’s safe to say that the Chang’e 4 team probably didn’t mention Pink Floyd’s song at the start of their mission – not because they’re all secretly bigger fans of King Crimson, but because the statement would be scientifically incorrect. It is not the moon’s “dark” side that Chang’e 4 landed on, but its far side – and that’s an important distinction. Each side of the moon is blessed with a roughly equal amount of the sun’s light it’s just that humans only get to see one side of it. Of course, Pink Floyd acknowledged that too. Listen carefully as the album’s climax fades to leave a thudding heartbeat and you’ll hear Gerry O’Driscoll, the doorman to Abbey Road studios where it was recorded, saying: “There is no dark side of the moon really. Matter of fact, it’s all dark.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a840ed5d317f576dfbcd3d45aa52760354980bda/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=294dc0f38ce765b2ef5aaaae1d8ea0f8","title":"nirvana sue designer marc jacobs over alleged copyright breach","story":"Representatives of the band are suing the brand over a logo in its Redux Grunge collectionNirvana are suing designer Marc Jacobs for copyright infringement. The brand’s recent Redux Grunge collection features several items that resemble the Seattle grunge band’s black-and-yellow iconography, Forbes reports.Representatives for the group, which split in 1994 following the death of frontman Kurt Cobain, claim that Marc Jacobs’ unauthorised use of “Nirvana’s copyrighted image on and to promote its products is intentional”. The suit claims that the use of Nirvana’s iconography, which the group has used since 1992, is to “make the ‘Grunge’ association with the collection more authentic”. has contacted representatives for Nirvana and Marc Jacobs.The suit also cites the use of Nirvana references in Marc Jacobs marketing materials, including a meme posted to the brand’s Tumblr account featuring a clip of the group’s 1991 hit, Smells Like Teen Spirit, and an image of Jacobs wearing a T-shirt above the words Come As You Are, the title of a 1992 hit by the trio.The suit describes Marc Jacobs’ actions as “oppressive, fraudulent and malicious” and claims that they “have caused Nirvana to suffer irreparable injuries” and “threaten to dilute the value of Nirvana’s licenses with its licensees for clothing products”.The department stores Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus are also included in the suit for selling the items that allegedly infringe the band’s copyright. The group is seeking monetary damages, the removal of sale of any such items and the removal of Nirvana references from promotional materials.Nirvana’s iconography is subject to regular bootlegging: the hoodies found on market stalls worldwide are seldom licensed items. The group would be unlikely to pursue these vendors because of the low possibility of recovering significant damages, says Alexander Ross, a partner at music lawyers Wiggins LLP.“Suing a major brand for alleged infringement, however, makes more sense from a financial perspective, and for PR and scale purposes, assuming of course that the action is successful,” says Ross. “It also sends a message to other players in the fashion industry that the IP in question is jealously guarded against infringement.”In 1992, at the height of Nirvana’s fame, Marc Jacobs was fired from designer Perry Ellis after showing his infamous grunge collection, which mixed plaid, silk and skull caps. “Grunge is anathema to fashion,” said American fashion critic Cathy Horyn. Jacobs started his own line a year later, launching his debut collection in 1994.The Nirvana suit is the latest controversy to hit the designer. “The label is turning out clothes and accessories that lack a compelling point of view, failing to generate the excitement created by younger peers Alexander Wang and Joseph Altuzarra,” New York Times reporter Steven Kurutz wrote in June. Kurutz cited luxury goods research by Exane BNP Paribas that estimated the brand had been losing more than £45m annually over the past few years.By contrast, the value of band merchandise continues to grow, becoming increasingly important to artists’ revenue streams following the decline of physical media and the impact of streaming on the market.Partnerships between bands and fashion houses have proven lucrative, such as Canadian rapper Drake’s collaboration with winter wear brand Canada Goose. Official artist merchandise can attain the status of high fashion, a charge led by the designs produced for Kanye West’s tour in support of his 2013 album Yeezus.The market for vintage band T-shirts is also booming. In 2011, an anonymous Australian buyer spent $10,000 on a Led Zeppelin T-shirt from the group’s 1979 gig at Knebworth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22b2808c2c88b1b78a6aaba538108350bc7fbfed/488_29_1772_1063/master/1772.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6cfa9f09d1f978cbe724684fc5f6f4c","title":"why exercise alone wont save us","story":"Sedentary lifestyles are killing us – we need to build activity into our everyday lives, not just leave it for the gym. By  Vybarr Cregan-ReidThis is the time of year when trainers are mined from under beds and gym kits are disinterred from the bottom drawer. Google searches relating to physical fitness peak in January. Many people even trawl the web to find out about “desk exercises” and “workouts on the go” in case they are too busy to use their new gym memberships.Our relationship with exercise is complicated. Reports from the UK and the US show it is something we persistently struggle with. As the new year rolls around, we anticipate having the drive to behave differently and become regular exercisers, even in the knowledge that we will probably fail to do so. Why do we want to exercise? What do we expect it to do for us? We all know we are supposed to be exercising, but hundreds of millions of us can’t face actually doing it. It is just possible the problem lies at the heart of the idea of exercise itself.Exercise is movement of the muscles and limbs for a specific outcome, usually to enhance physical fitness. As such, for most of us, it is an optional addition to the working day – yet another item on a long list of responsibilities alongside the fulfilment of parental duties or earning money to put food on the table. But because the principal beneficiary of exercise is ourselves, it is one of the easiest chores to shirk. At the end of the working day, millions of us prefer to indulge in sedentary leisure activities instead of what we all think is good for us: a workout. Fitness crazes are like diets: if any of them worked, there wouldn’t be so many. CrossFit, the intensely physical, communal workout incorporating free weights, squats, pull-ups and so forth, is still less than 20 years old. Spin classes – vigorous group workouts on stationary bikes – have only been around for about 30. Aerobics was a craze about a decade before that, although many of its high-energy routines had already been around for a while. (The pastel horror of 1970s Jazzercise is probably best forgotten.) Before that, there was the jogging revolution, which began in the US in the early 1960s. The Joggers Manual, published in 1963 by the Oregon Heart Foundation, was a leaflet of about 200 words that sought to address the postwar panic about sedentary lifestyles by encouraging an accessible form of physical activity, explaining that “jogging is a bit more than a walk”. The jogging boom took a few years to get traction, hitting its stride in the mid- to late-80s, but it remains one of the most popular forms of exercise, now also in groups.The exercise craze that dominated the 1950s was, oddly, not even an exercise. The vibrating exercise belt promised users could achieve effortless weight loss by having their midriffs violently jiggled. It didn’t work, but you can still find similar machines available for purchase today.These fads even came with their own particular fashions – legwarmers, leotards, Lycra. So is our obsession with fitness doomed to be the stuff of embarrassing passing “phases”? Is exercise itself a fad?It is not news that we are becoming more sedentary as a species. The problem has been creeping up on us for generations. As industry and technology solved the physical demands of manual labour, they created new challenges for the human body.Evidence about bone strength and density gleaned from fossils of early humans suggests that, for hundreds of thousands of years, normal levels of movement were much higher than ours today. And the range of work required of the human body to subsist was sizeable: everything from foraging for food and finding water to hunting, constructing basic shelters, manufacturing tools and evading predators. The fossil record tells us that many prehistoric humans were stronger and fitter than today’s Olympians.A hundred years ago, while life was easier than it had been for our hunter-gatherer forebears, it was still required that shopping was fetched, floors scrubbed, wood chopped and washing done by hand. Modern urban environments do not invite anything like the same kinds of work from the body. It is not easy to clock up those miles when cities are built to prioritise cars and treat pedestrians as secondary. We are not assisted by our environments to move like we used to, for reasons tied up with motivation, safety and accessibility.Technological innovations have led to countless minor reductions of movement. To clean a rug in the 1940s, most people took it into their yard and whacked the bejeezus out of it for 20 minutes. Fast-forward a few decades and we can set robot vacuum cleaners to wander about our living rooms as we order up some shopping to be delivered, put on the dishwasher, cram a load into the washer-dryer, admire the self-cleaning oven, stack some machine-cut logs in the grate, pour a glass of milk from the frost-free fridge or thumb a capsule into the coffee maker. Each of these devices and behaviours is making it a bit more difficult for us to keep moving regularly throughout our day.As we step through various innovations, we tend to think of the work that is no longer required as “saved”. Cleaning a rug once burned about 200 calories, while activating a robo-vac uses about 0.2 – an activity drop of a thousandfold, with nothing to replace it. Nobody, when they buy a labour-saving device, thinks: “How am I going to replace that movement I have saved?”As a result of our leisurely lifestyles, our bones are thinner and our muscles weaker, and while these are not problems in themselves, they are part of the larger, fleshier story whereby the diminution of movement is shackling humans to the very biggest global killers. Heart disease and strokes are responsible for about 17 million deaths a year, according to the World Health Organization.All-day activity trackers like the Apple Watch and the Fitbit (which is only a decade old this year) have attempted to make an intervention into this sandpit of sedentariness. Widespread use of wearables may be helping people to move more, but technology created this problem of sedentary work and leisure, and cannot solve it alone.Exercise, in these terms, is not a fad, or an option, or an add-on to our busy lifestyles: it is keeping us alive. But before it can work for us, our whole approach needs to change.As a result of the Miracle Cure report, doctors were urged to promote regular exercise among their patients. Humans obviously need regular activity, but the modern world strives to take exertion out of our lives. Modernity is characterised by imperatives to simplify, improve and maximise efficiency. In much the same way, medical bodies trying to motivate the population to exercise promise big results with the absolute minimum of disruption to our busy, seated lives.Anyone researching exercise strategies this new year will find that the government recommends “at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity such as cycling or brisk walking every week and strength exercises on 2 or more days a week that work all the major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms)”.If 150 minutes – or half an hour five times a week – is too much for you, and the data suggests that for most of us it is, another public health strategy promotes the efficacy of being active for just 10 minutes a day. Public Health England launched its Active10 campaign on the grounds that just 10 minutes’ brisk walking each day “counts as exercise” and “can reduce your risk of serious illnesses like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, dementia and some cancers”.Even less time is required for high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which can involve bouts of just 20 seconds of intense effort a few times a week. It seems there is good evidence for the efficacy of very short bursts of strenuous anaerobic exercise, such as sprinting or cycling hard, followed by a brief recovery period. Interval training may improve insulin sensitivity and oxygen circulation, and increase muscle mass. But one of the early researchers into HIIT, kinesiologist Dr Martin Gibala, worried that despite its benefits, it required “an extremely high level of subject motivation”, because all-out exertion is unpleasant and can lead to dizziness, vomiting or injury. “Given the extreme nature of the exercise,” he wrote, “it is doubtful that the general population could safely or practically adopt the model.”While all of these three modes of exercise are effective in different ways, and each has its proponents and committed followers, none is an all-round solution for a “fit” human body. But the problem is not really with the exercises themselves it is what we tend to do in between those bursts of activity.The health effects of being sedentary are as common and recognisable as they are serious. Anxiety, depression, heart disease, breast and colon cancer, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and the leading cause of global disability, back pain, are all driven by sedentary behaviours.For our bodies to function properly, they operate on the assumption that we will be burning calories throughout the day, and not in short bursts. It is clear that periods of sedentariness are bad for the human body, and some exercise is always going to be better than none the issue is not really to do with the types of exercise, but with our approach to them and what we expect them to achieve. We know from the data that the human relationship with exercise is predominantly characterised as both optional and additional to an otherwise sedentary life, which itself causes a ton of problems. As long as physical activity is orced from the real work of our lives, we will find reasons for not doing it.The rise of exercise is synonymous with the rise of leisure. We associate this with the start of the Industrial Revolution, but in fact it dates from much earlier. Once humans settled and began to build, several thousand years ago, hierarchies began to form, particularly in cities, as did the gap between master and servant. To be one of the elite meant others were doing the physical work for you. For the masters, there was time to fill, and into this space grew the idea of leisure. Exercise also emerges here, in the imbalance created in the spread of labour performed across a population. Ever since, we have seen a powerful link between exercise and inequality.The wealthy men of ancient Greece, deprived of work by their slaves and with little else to do, invented a new place called the gymnasium, an open space in the city where they could strip off and gambol about naked, competing in made-up challenges to keep each other fit for war.Later, the Romans also celebrated the value of exercise. Cicero, the Roman politician and lawyer, said: “It is exercise alone that supports the spirits and keeps the mind in vigour.” Pliny the Younger, a writer and also a lawyer, said: “It is remarkable how one’s wits are sharpened by physical exercise.” Like their Greek gym buddies, these men were privileged and wealthy. They understood that even though the slave class did their work for them, exercise and physical activity were essential for a long and sane life.After the Greeks and Romans, exercise all but disappeared from western culture. It didn’t resurface properly until the 18th century, when inactivity became a problem for a certain class of gentleman. In 1797, the Monthly Magazine announced a new patent for Francis Lowndes’ Gymnasticon, the earliest of the static exercise machines – a frame in which the user sat, turning a spindle with his arms and operating a treadle with his feet. The article noted that “when peculiar or sedentary occupations enforce confinement to the house, it promises to be equally useful to the healthy as to the sick. The merchant, without withdrawing his attention from his accounts, and the student, while occupied in writing or reading, may have his lower limbs kept in constant motion by the slightest exertion, or, the assistance of a child.” The handle on the contraption’s lower spindle was arranged so that, if desired, a child could be employed to turn the wheel, to save the user valuable energy.In the early 20th century, calisthenics became popular among people with limited means of expending physical energy. In the opening pages of EM Forster’s Howards End, from 1910, we are introduced to the Wilcox family as they come and go in their country-house garden. They are “new money” they see the world instrumentally, and are mostly allergic to it, too. A visitor reports the scene in a letter: “Then Evie comes out, and does some calisthenic exercises on a machine that is tacked on to a greengage tree – they put everything to use – and then she says ‘a-tissue,’ and in she goes.” Like inactivity, hay fever only seemed to afflict those higher up the social scale.In 1831 the Journal of Health defined calisthenics as “a reasonable, methodical, and regular employment of the exercises best calculated to develop the physical powers of young girls, without detriment to the perfecting of the moral faculties”. Its adoption was necessary because “young girls have not the same freedom as boys in their outdoor exercise, and their customary amusements and occupations, when not at school, are of a more sedentary nature”.Since our modern way of life denies many of us the physical exertion that kept our ancestors healthy, one way to gain social capital is to add it back in.Any kind of communal exercise gives us a sense of belonging, of shared values and endeavours, aside even from its more general physical and mental benefits. When people gather together in a gym or in an exercise class, at least one aspect of what they are doing is joining together in a civic activity that ensures their collective survival, just like the ancient Greeks before them.If being fit promotes long life, you might expect being an elite athlete to help you reach a ripe old age. It doesn’t. Olympians buy themselves an extra 2.8 years on average, according to a 2012 study. Devoting your life to sport and exercise will buy you more time, but once you factor in the Olympians’ lifelong sustained attention to diet and healthy living, as well as tens of thousands of hours spent training, 2.8 years might not really seem sufficient recompense.Instead, the fittest and healthiest people on the planet have never been to a gym. These people, who report high levels of wellbeing and live extraordinarily long lives, inhabit what have been called “blue zones” – areas where lifestyles lead to peculiar longevity. The term was coined by two demographers, Gianni Pes and Michel Poulain, who, while collecting data on clusters of centenarians on the island of Sardinia, identified places of especially high longevity on their map with a blue felt-tip pen. Because clusters of long-lived people are often found in geographically remote places (also including parts of Okinawa, Costa Rica and Greece), jackpot genes seem like a strong candidate to explain their longevity. But a famous study of Danish twins has concluded that a long life seems to be only “moderately heritable”. Over the years, many studies have looked at the lifestyles of people in “blue zones” and found that a number of their customs and habits contribute to a long life (everything from a sense of belonging and purpose to not smoking, or eating a predominantly plant-based diet). In the list of contributory factors, there is a noticeable absence of exercise.In my conversation with Pes, he repeatedly stressed that while diet and environment are important components of longevity, being sedentary is the enemy, and sustained, low-level activity is the key that research by him and others has uncovered: not the intense kinds of activity we tend to associate with exercise, but energy expended throughout the day. The supercentenarians he has worked with all walked several miles each day throughout their working lives. They never spent much time, if any, seated at desks.Pes has recently been studying workers in one of the island’s regions of longevity, Seulo (population around 1,000). He discovered one group of women who had spent their working lives seated, but nonetheless reached a great age. They had been working treadles (pedal-powered sewing machines), which meant they had regularly burned sufficient calories to derive the longevity benefits of remaining active. (Lowndes’ Gymnasticon, which works like a treadle, is starting to look a little less ridiculous as a solution for sedentary workers.)For all the trillions invested in healthcare year on year, there are regions in high-income nations (such as the UK and the US) where life expectancy is still as low as it was in the mid-60s. In Tower Hamlets, one of the poorer parts of London, men can only expect an average of 61 years of good health – and women just 56.So far, researchers agree that sustained periods of low-level activity seem to work well. Aiming for 10,000 steps a day is a good idea, but 15,000 better resembles the distances likely covered by our prehistoric ancestors, and indeed by those Sardinian centenarians.For those of us who can’t move to Sardinia and become a shepherd, a review published in the Lancet in 2016 found that “high levels of moderate-intensity physical activity (ie, about 60-75 min per day) seem to eliminate the increased risk of death associated with high sitting time”.So even if we go to the gym on a Saturday morning, our absolute inactivity at other times can still be damaging to the body. Low and moderate activity for longer or sustained periods seems to produce the best results. It looks like excessive high-intensity activity (the kind we see in elite athletes) drives metabolism and cell turnover, and may even, when all factors are taken into account, accelerate the ageing process.As those all-day activity trackers continue to mature into their second decade, they will no doubt find better ways of encouraging us out of our chairs. At the moment, though, they can only count the things we have done, not the opportunities for movement we have missed. They make us more likely to be attentive to our activity than our inactivity.After two centuries of trying, we should accept that exercise is not working as a global fitness strategy while it remains an addition to the working day. In the long view, it is starting to look a lot like a fad. Government guidelines in the UK and other countries that encourage sport and exercise are failing. These strategies struggle because we are trying to get people to give up what little leisure time they have to pursue activities that require substantial additional effort.Perhaps instead we should encourage people to make the kinds of daily decisions that result in a healthier life. What is needed are the kinds of strategies that would make exercise unnecessary. Urban planning that better addresses the outdoor experience and encourages movement would be a key part of this change. But on an inidual level, we can think about returning a little of the friction that technology has so subtly smoothed out for us, and make it easy to get things done. Exercise becomes physical activity when it is part of your daily life.A year ago, my car lease came up for renewal. I had been a driver for nearly 30 years, but after all the alarming research I had read about the impact of modern lifestyles, I could not possibly keep it. I now walk miles more than I used to. Without a car, getting to the gym involved a 70-minute round trip. By the time I had walked there and back, the workouts seemed less necessary, so I cancelled my membership.I tried other things, too. I experimented with a standing desk, but I knew from Pes’s research in Sardinia that it is not sitting itself that is bad, but the inactivity associated with it. Standing in one place for hours is only marginally better than sitting there. The Gymnasticon is also making a comeback. Its new incarnation is the treadmill desk, which seeks to keep office workers permanently on the move. From a health perspective it seems superb, but it is hardly practical. Getting a less comfortable office chair would probably be as effective a strategy, making it less easy to settle into for long periods of immobility.You don’t have to join a gym this year. The numbers tell us that exercise is not the solution to the problems associated with physical inactivity, for the simple reason that these two things are not opposites. The antidote is activity: to find and recover some of the movement that modern life has been taking from us for centuries.Vybarr Cregan-Reid is the author of Primate Change: How the World We Made Is Changing Us, which is available to buy at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e0f0f60d130e8c0762d1e7f774567f040f0f01c/0_142_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9ee9495722e3f0329c8970ccd0153d6","title":"brexit freight ferry firm appears all geared up to deliver pizzas","story":"Terms and conditions on Seaborne website seem to be intended for food companyFirst, it emerged that the “startup” company hired to operate extra ferries as part of no-deal Brexit planning had no ships.Now, new questions are being asked about the readiness of Seaborne Freight to handle the £13.8m contract after it turned out that terms and conditions on its website appeared to be intended for a food delivery firm.“It is the responsibility of the customer to thoroughly check the supplied goods before agreeing to pay for any mealorder,” read part of the text on the company’s website.Another section, which appeared to be constructed with a view more to mitigating against the impact of prank pizza orders than transporting goods across some of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, warned: “Users are prohibited from making false orders through our website.”It added: “Seaborne Freight (UK) Limited reserves the right to seek compensation through legal action for any losses incurred as the result of hoax delivery requests and will prosecute to the full extent of the law.” Chris Grayling’s Department for Transport said a section of the terms and conditions on the company’s website had been put up in error and was being immediately rectified.Among those criticising the company after the curious language on the terms and conditions was first pointed out by Twitter users was Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who said: “Seaborne Freight.

They’ve seemingly copied and pasted their terms off a takeaway fast food website, and their login portal sends you back to Google.”Other signs that the website may have been cobbled together included a “portal login” section that was an image of username and password boxes rather than an actual means of logging in. A language settings option also appeared to be an image of a union flag rather than an interactive option.Grayling, the transport secretary, was forced to defend the contract on Wednesday when he said he would “make no apologies for supporting a new British business” after widespread criticism.The contract is one of three agreements worth a total of £107.7m signed by the government to help ease congestion at Dover by securing extra lorry capacity in the event of a no-deal Brexit.There was also pressure on the government to guarantee that the new ferry services aimed at easing pressure on Dover would be crewed by British seafarers.Mick Cash, the general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers union, wrote to Grayling to seek assurances that any ships would be fully crewed by UK workers and to stress that collective bargaining agreements should be in place.Sandra Welch, the deputy chief executive of the Sailors’ Society charity, expressed concerns about safety. “Safety is paramount,” she said. “And to avoid tragedy it is crucial that the right people with the necessary skills are involved.”Seaborne hopes to operate freight ferries from Ramsgate from late March, beginning with two ships and increasing to four by the end of the summer.A spokesperson at Grayling’s department said on Thursday: “Before any contract was signed, due diligence on Seaborne Freight was carried out both by senior officials at the Department for Transport, and highly reputable independent third-party organisations with significant experience and expertise into Seaborne’s financial, technical and legal underpinning.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68eb727af573e82160256cbc9d42099b15a05388/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1207720b578d428eb971165ed9e9053","title":"most tory members would choose no deal over may brexit plan","story":"More than half of Conservative party members want Theresa May’s Brexit deal to be rejected in favour of leaving the EU with no deal, according to a survey.The poll, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), found a majority of the Tory rank and file are convinced that leaving the EU without a deal is better than the prime minister’s Brexit plan.The findings were released on Friday by the ESRC-funded party members project, run from Queen Mary University of London and Sussex University.The findings are a further blow to May, who hopes to win a majority in parliament for her EU deal, which is expected to be put to the vote later in January. In November, she appealed directly to the public in an attempt to put pressure on rebellious backbenchers to fall in line.The survey result will spur on a minority of MPs who want the UK to leave on World Trade Organization rules.It comes after the EU refused to hold further meetings to discuss May’s Brexit deal, and as the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, warned no deal would become far more likely if MPs rejected the prime minister’s proposals.Academics surveyed 1,215 ordinary Conservative party members, together with a representative sample of 1,675 voters.Prof Tim Bale, who led the research, said the findings showed No 10 could not depend upon constituency associations to persuade Tory MPs to back May’s deal.“The Tory rank and file, it seems, are convinced that no deal is better than May’s deal,” he said. “Tory members’ dislike for the PM’s deal really comes out when we asked about a referendum in which the choice came down to her deal or no deal.Bale suggested there were two specific issues behind the opposition to May’s deal, the first being the Irish backstop.“Tory members, like Tory voters, are utterly unconvinced, despite their own government’s best recent efforts, that a no-deal Brexit would cause serious disruption.“In short, Mrs May has failed not only to convince the country, and quite probably parliament, that her Brexit deal is a good one, she has also failed to convince the party faithful,” Bale said.The research showed that a greater proportion of Tory members think the government has made a mess of negotiating Brexit than those who just support the party."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e4fa86e78515b81e4818440215a994034d29d43/0_113_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=001851f23a66349f7cbb076e23aeeb0f","title":"what could change 4 discover on far side of the moon","story":"Chang’e 4 will test soil composition, try to grow plants, and listen for traces of Big BangWhen we look up at the full moon, we only ever see one face: the “man in the moon” is always gazing back at us. Scientists believe that the far side, eternally hidden from view, may hold the key to fundamental mysteries about the moon’s formation and its earliest history.China’s Chang’e 4 mission could reveal new clues to the cataclysmic collision that created the moon and uncover the origins of the water that is unexpectedly abundant in lunar soil.The moon’s far side is sometimes known as the dark side, although it is not darker than the near side in any literal sense. It undergoes the same phases of illumination by the Sun as the side facing Earth. But because the moon spins on its axis at exactly the same rate as it orbits Earth, one side remains permanently out of view.It was only in 1959, when the first images of the far side were beamed back by the Soviet Union’s Luna 3, that intriguing differences were revealed. The far side is pockmarked by more craters and appears almost devoid of the seas of solidified lava, known as maria, that form the shadowy shape of a face that we see from Earth.Scientists believe that as asteroids pummelled the lunar surface during the solar system’s early history, giant lava flows on the moon’s near side filled impact craters, obscuring them from view.On the far side, fewer lava flows occurred, leaving intact a pristine record of ancient impacts. The oldest, largest and deepest of these is the Aitken Basin, where Chang’e 4 is now poised for exploration.Testing the composition of the soil could help narrow down theories about how the moon formed and the beginnings of the solar system.The mission will also conduct the first astronomy observations from the moon’s far side, which is seen as a uniquely attractive site for monitoring radio waves coming from deep space. Astronomers operating Earth-bound radio telescopes have to constantly grapple with electromagnetic interference from human activity: shortwave broadcasting, maritime communication, telephone and television signals. The far side of the moon is shielded from such signals, making it far easier to pick up faint fingerprints left by the Big Bang. These traces left across the cosmos could help tell us how the universe inflated at unimaginable speed in the first trillionth of a second after the Big Bang.Chang’e 4 could also help pave the way for China’s human spaceflight ambitions. One theory for the abundance of water in lunar soil is that it is produced by reactions between the solar wind (a flow of charged particles including hydrogen) and minerals in the soil (containing oxygen).“People are trying to reproduce this process in the lab, but it’s really difficult to do correctly,” said Martin Wieser, a researcher at the Swedish Institute of Space Physics and the principal investigator on an instrument onboard Chang’e designed to measure how the solar wind interacts with the lunar surface. “The only way, really, is to go to the lunar surface and look at it there. Chang’e 4 is in the ideal place to study this process.”Understanding how water is produced and distributed in the lunar soil could be crucial for establishing a more permanent human lunar outpost. The amount in the soil is not large – an area of 10 sq metres might contain only enough water to fill a glass – but harvesting it could eventually be cheaper than bringing water from Earth.The craft is also carrying a mini-greenhouse, which will test how well plants, specifically potatoes and small flowering Arabidopsis plants, related to cabbage, grow on the moon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7923aee3ab97ec7337b3cb8837787922a4a6cb6/167_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa850f30aa1b09dae4105a5d50f7162e","title":"nearby galaxy large magellanic cloud set to collide with milky way","story":"Collision will ‘cause fireworks’ but probably won’t happen for about 2.5 billion years As if battered post-Christmas finances, a looming disorderly Brexit and the prospect of a fresh nuclear arms race were not enough to dampen spirits, astronomers have declared that a nearby galaxy will slam into the Milky Way and could knock our solar system far into the cosmic void.The unfortunate discovery was made after scientists ran computer simulations on the movement of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), one of the many satellite galaxies that orbits the Milky Way. Rather than circling at a safe distance, or breaking free of the Milky Way’s gravitational pull, the researchers found the LMC is destined to clatter into the galaxy we call home.At the moment, the LMC is estimated to be about 163,000 light years from the Milky Way and speeding away at 250 miles per second. But simulations by astrophysicists at Durham University show that the LMC will eventually slow down and turn back towards us, ultimately smashing into the Milky Way in about 2.5 billion years’ time.While inidual stars and planets are unlikely to collide, the arrival of a galaxy weighing as much as 250 billion suns will still wreak havoc. “The whole of the Milky Way will be shaken and the entire solar system could be ejected into outer space,” said Carlos Frenk, director of the Institute for Computational Cosmology at Durham. “If that happens, I don’t see how our descendants, if we have any, will be able to withstand it.”In one sense, the collision with the LMC is long overdue. The Milky Way is an oddball among spiral galaxies. The halo of stars that surrounds its galactic disc contains far fewer stars than comparable galaxies. But that is not all. The supermassive black hole at the Milky Way’s centre is paltry, only one-tenth as massive as those found at the hearts of similar galaxies.The galactic merger will change all of this. “Once the LMC gets gobbled up by the Milky Way, our galaxy will become a beautiful, normal spiral,” said Frenk. “Most of the halo will become stars from the LMC and the black hole will gorge on this sudden unexpected abundance of fuel and it will go berserk.”The LMC holds vast amounts of gas that will be devoured by the supermassive black hole until it reaches up to 10 times its present mass. As it feeds, the black hole will become “active” and send out powerful jets of high-energy radiation. While intense beams of gamma radiation may potentially spark mass extinctions, the radiation driven by the black hole is unlikely to pose a threat to any life that may exist on Earth, the authors write.In the past, astronomers who concerned themselves with the demise of the Milky Way focused their attention on the upcoming collision with the Andromeda galaxy. At five times the mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud, Andromeda could completely destroy the Milky Way when the two collide. That cosmic catastrophe is expected in about four billion years’ time.But the merger with the LMC could postpone the cataclysm, said Frenk. “One of the by-products of the collision with the LMC is it will delay armageddon,” he said. “It will move the Milky Way a bit and that may buy us a couple of billion years.“The LMC is big but it won’t completely destroy our galaxy,” he said. “It’ll produce these amazing fireworks, but it doesn’t have the mass to create a huge disturbance. The collision with Andromeda really will be armageddon. That really will be the end of the Milky Way as we know it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d64e4e79ceed9e7da39e57b98589fb46ab5073b2/0_169_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c5839d7506d8a8035cd5626c51d6a03","title":"age against the machine secret enjoying long life carl honore","story":"The writer Carl Honoré used to think of ageing as a ‘chamber of horrors’. Now he argues we are in a ‘golden age’ for older peopleRead inspiring stories of four of Carl Honoré’s ‘ageing heroes’Three years ago, Carl Honoré, the journalist whose series of books, starting with In Praise of Slow in 2004, has made him the guru of slow living, had an epiphany. Like a true Canadian, though one born in Scotland and domiciled in London, he adores ice hockey, and still plays hard and fast at the age of 51. But one day, at a tournament in Gateshead, someone pointed out that he was the oldest player among the 240 competitors. “I knew that I was one of the oldest, but being told in such raw terms that I was the oldest – it just shook me. It knocked me for six in a way that shocked me.”Honoré was 48 at the time, “the big 50” was looming, and what he calls “the terrible weight of the number” started dragging him down. Was ageing really going to be as bad as everyone said? Was all he had to look forward to now decline, decrepitude and death? On the train back to London, as his team-mates knocked back the beers, he decided to embark on a book on the subject.“I’ve found with all my books that they start with what is almost an out-of-body experience when I see myself in sharp relief from the side,” he tells me. “I needed to understand my own relationship with the number, with what ageing means, and where I was going to be in 10 or 20 years.” The result is B(older): Making the Most of Our Longer Lives – a call for society to become less ageist and for iniduals to stop worrying about the process of ageing and wring every drop out of whatever time is allotted to us.Honoré has travelled the world in search of active, high-achieving older people, but he stresses that he doesn’t want to hold the “outliers” up as the norm. He is more interested in a state of mind in which the average 70- and 80-year-old goes on working if they want to, volunteering, starting their own enterprises, playing competitive sport, having great sex – and society doesn’t bat an eye. It is ageist, he argues, to stop people being able to do those things but it’s also ageist to make a big deal of it. Still having sex at 80, still making TV programmes at 90, even running marathons at 100? Why shouldn’t they be?The conclusion Honoré came to, after three years of research and an examination of the way older people are treated around the world, was that it was in many ways a golden age for “the old” (a term he would never use): there were more of them, they were healthier, more active and many were better off than in previous generations. They could no longer be ignored or marginalised. But, in his view, that is just a beginning. “It can be so much better,” he says, “if we move a lot of goalposts and change the way everything from healthcare to politics to the business world to education is organised.” He argues that the idea of being educated between the ages of five and 21, working for 40 years and then retiring on a pension at 60 is completely out of date, imagining a much more fluid way of life where we dip in and out of education and the job market and never formally “retire”.I ask Honoré at what age we become “old”. He refuses to supply a number. “I use the word ‘older’ in a very elastic way,” he says. “The definition is so fluid, and to box people in and say: ‘This is old’ narrows horizons. What do we gain by saying: ‘This person is old’?” He believes ageism is lessening but remains endemic. In fact, he says that when he began the book he was one of its worst proponents. “When I was younger, I was so ageist. I had a dread of growing old. I had bought into that idea that you hit 35 and it’s just a downward spiral. I used to think of old people as just sad and cantankerous. But, if you look at the stats, the people with the highest levels of happiness and life satisfaction in Britain are the over-60s. That doesn’t take away from the fact that many people will be very unhappy, but the story we are told and that we tell ourselves is that everyone is unhappy. It’s always the worst-case scenario: that’s what we are contaminated by.”Honoré no longer frets about ageing. “My biggest worry was that I would end up in a gloomy place,” he says, “but, thankfully, the opposite is true – I feel so much more optimistic now than I did when I embarked on the book. We have created a culture where ageing is seen as a chamber of horrors. There is no chink of light in it. I suspected that was not true, and along the way I found it to be utterly untrue.”B(older): Making the Most of Our Longer Lives is published by Simon \u0026amp Schuster (£16.99)1. If you think of yourself as old, you will be old. The media will bang on about dementia and loneliness, but ignore them. Concentrate on the upside.2. Take yourself out of your comfort zone. Resist being pigeonholed keep experimenting challenge yourself and society’s stereotyping of you.3. Try to stay healthy. Eat well and take lots of exercise – it’s good for brain and body. Exercise doesn’t have to mean playing competitive ice hockey the odd brisk walk will keep you in shape.4. Look for positive role models. Helen Mirren, David Attenborough and, best of all, Michelangelo, who lived until the ripe old age (in 16th-century terms) of 88 and spent the final 20 years of his life designing and overseeing the construction of St Peter’s Basilica in Rome. Now that’s a way to go out.5. Seek to become the person you always wanted to be. One reason many people are at their happiest in their 60s is that they feel freer and less beholden to others. They contain all their previous selves and can start to make sense of them.6. Don’t just maintain social connections with your own age group: mix across the generations as much as you can. Inter-generational contact has become increasingly difficult, but if we can do it we benefit – and society benefits.7. Be willing to let stuff go. If that friendship isn’t working, drop it. Streamline your life. There is less time left, so make it count.8. Ageing should be a process of opening rather than closing doors. “We will lose some things – speed, stamina, a bit of mental agility – but in many other respects we gain,” says Honoré. We learn new skills, have greater social awareness, are likely to be more altruistic, are “lighter” in our approach to life – because we are less hung up on creating a good impression – and can see the bigger picture. It may be that we are in a position to make a greater contribution to society in our 60s and 70s than in our so-called prime.9. Honesty is the best policy. Don’t try to pretend you are not 75 or 85 or whatever age you are. “As soon as we start lying about our age, we’re giving the number a terrible power – a power it doesn’t deserve,” says Honoré. People do it because there are so many ageist assumptions attached to age, but the way to fight back is to subvert those assumptions.10. Society tells us that sex, love and romance belong to the young, but it’s not true. Plenty of older people continue to experience the joy of sex. But there are no rules: have as much – or as little – as you want. Some older people see it as a blessed release to escape the shackles of falling in love (and lust), but others can’t imagine life without it. Whatever turns you on.11. Ignore people who say you can’t teach an old dog new tricks. You can. Despite the common perception that creativity is the preserve of the young, we can get more creative as we get older. Our neural networks loosen up and we have the confidence and freedom to challenge groupthink. Honoré was encouraged last year when the Turner prize abolished its age limit for artists. Michelangelo could have been a contender.12. Don’t pretend death isn’t coming. Embrace it – just not yet. “It’s useful to know our lives are bookended,” says Honoré. “When time is running out, it becomes more precious. It gives life shape and, in some ways, meaning.” Don’t dwell morbidly on it, but don’t shy away from it either. The closer you get to it, the less you are likely to fear it and the greater your focus will be on the things that really matter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f99a64eae077787e68323768518495aa5f100a50/0_113_4124_2474/master/4124.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c58802cd65d24a4b96fee014949f7d3e","title":"benefit cap single mothers make up 85percent of those affected data shows","story":"DWP records show 134,044 households had support capped, with single mothers accounting for 114,337The vast majority of people being penalised by the government’s benefit cap are single mothers, new analysis has found.Records show that 134,044 households have had support capped by the government, with single mothers accounting for 114,337 of those. They appear to show a significant jump from August last year, when nearly 50,000 single parents were reportedly facing a drop in benefits due to the cap.The benefit cap, which limits the total amount households can receive in benefits to £20,000 a year, or £23,000 in Greater London, was envisaged as an “incentive” to persuade unemployed people to move into work.Critics claim it is forcing many people into poverty and resulted in social cleansing because rents in inner-city areas are so high.Labour claims the statistics show ministers are failing to assess the impact of their policies upon vulnerable children.The shadow work and pensions secretary, Margaret Greenwood, said single mothers were being pushed into poverty by the cap.“The Conservatives have pushed ahead with their austerity agenda with scant regard for the impact on low-income families,” she said. “Labour will build a social security system that is there for any of us in our time of need.”The latest figures were released on the DWP’s Stat-Xplore site in November and include statistics showing the number of men and women whose benefits were capped up to August of last year.The latest figures also show that 120,297 single claimant women had their benefits capped, compared with just 13,743 single claimant men over the same period. The vast majority of those women had dependent children.The latest disclosure follows other recent studies which found that the cap was leaving more people in debt and pushing poor children further into poverty.A study of more than 10,000 benefit-capped households by the Policy in Practice consultancy found that for every child whose parents moved back into work as a result of the cap, eight more would grow up in families whose financial circumstances  worsened following the introduction of the policy.More than half of the households affected by the benefit cap were left stuck on it for six months or more. The average gap between rent and housing benefit for families stuck on the cap was £3,750 a year.Pioneered by the former chancellor George Osborne, the cap limited total benefits to £26,000 per year at its introduction in 2013. It was then cut in November 2016 to the present levels, quadrupling the number of families affected.The DWP did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99653ad95cfa479976bbb56c4076e3a46696226a/0_0_4076_2446/master/4076.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5aa90a5a9a20276ad95773cef89572b5","title":"england women rugby union elite player contracts","story":"It has taken a while but, for richer or poorer, the Rugby Football Union has finally taken the plunge and made a long-term commitment to its top female players. If the announcement of 28 professional 15-a-side contracts is not a strictly ground-breaking development, the implications are sizeable.Not for nothing did Simon Middleton, England’s head coach, describe the RFU’s move as revolutionary or his captain, Sarah Hunter, call it a huge day for all concerned, even though full-time deals already exist in sevens and were briefly introduced for XVs players before the 2017 World Cup, then subsequently withdrawn. This time RFU officials insist they are in for the long haul.The timing is slightly ironic given the recent cost-cutting at Twickenham, caused in part by an unforeseen overspend on the redeveloped East Stand. According to the RFU’s Nicky Ponsford, however, this fresh investment will prove worthwhile. “We’ve created a sustainable model which will carry us through to 2021 and beyond,” she said. “It’s been our long-term ambition and shows the RFU’s commitment to growing the game and its belief in the future of the sport.”Against this backdrop pressure has been building on the RFU to do the decent thing and allow England’s players the same scope to prepare and recover as their male counterparts. “It’s something I didn’t think would probably happen in my playing career,” said Hunter. “It’s hugely significant. As players it means our focus can now be solely on becoming the best we can be.”The top women’s XVs players in New Zealand and France now operate on a semi-professional basis but nowhere else in the world are permanent full-time deals of this type in place. It hardly creates a level playing field globally but England, having won one Six Nations title in the past six years after choosing to focus much of their energy on sevens, will happily settle for world domination.“We want to become the No 1 side in the world again and we want to win the 2021 World Cup,” said Middleton bluntly. “This offers us a massive opportunity but with it comes massive expectation. It’s up to us to do everything we can to meet that expectation.”Professionalism also involves ensuring the numbers add up. The RFU is refusing to reveal precise financial details but it is understood the fattest annual contract is worth a relatively modest £28,000, with sponsorship and match fees on top. “We’re comfortable we’re in the right ballpark compared to other unions and other women’s sports,” Ponsford said. “I don’t think financial sacrifice came into the conversations.”Amy Cokayne, however, will continue to combine rugby with her RAF duties and no Lamborghinis or Ferraris will be rolling off the forecourts. Any prospect of England’s top men taking a big pay-cut – they are currently paid £23,000 per match – in a gender-neutral act of solidarity also currently feels remote. “I’m not going to make any comments about what the men’s team earn,” Ponsford said.“The important thing is that the RFU have made a commitment to the women’s game and are looking to support it in the longer term.”There is no contract for the centre Amber Reed, currently injured, or the prop Heather Kerr but for the vastly experienced Hunter and Katy Daley-McLean, both capped more than 100 times, this day is deserved reward for their long years of unpaid toil."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/970cff9fc8e09a68c42b0b158e8c8e08a50871d1/0_140_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=897bfb58dd6a3b50a92c1f0fbc6340ad","title":"australia v india scg fourth test day two live","story":"India’s session.

Not being treated as a legitimate part of the bowling plans. At least he keeps this over tighter than yesterday, only conceding three.

Whether M Marsh or T Paine walks out at 6 or 7 – does it really make a difference? Don’t we need to focus far more on straight up form, and who is showing a preparedness to bat in a sensible, level headed way? Where exactly they bat in the order is not quite the issue. Can they face it in test conditions? Are they reliable in technique? Are they the sort of character we can see in the team in the long run? (England and beyond). They are the only real questions surely. “The intense focus by many on where exactly our mob sit in the order is like giving Scott Morrison a comeback plan based on where his ministers sit on the Treasury benches during question time. Your thoughts?”112th over: India 371-5 (Pujara 171, Pant 19) Lyon to Pant, cut away for a single. Lyon has dropped short a fair bit this morning. Pujara helps one around the corner for three.

There’s a weary and jaded tread to Josh H, I have to say. He looked sore and tired chasing to the boundary earlier.

The Hazlewood 2018-19 story.110th over: India 367-5 (Pujara 168, Pant 18) Three singles from the Lyon over, comfortably collecting without trying to overdo it. Pant is still keeping his cool.“They’ve been brilliant, haven’t they?” writes SH of the umpiring. “Don’t remember too many decisions getting overturned.” True, and they’ve got some very skinny ones correct. 109th over: India 364-5 (Pujara 166, Pant 17) Starc tries the yorker again, but only hits Pant’s pad and flies away for four leg byes. A couple of singles follow. The runs keep coming. “Geoff, I must apostrophise your pant pun with apostrophe. Not possible if misused.” Thank you, Antony Ransome. For those unacquainted, apostrophise: to “address an exclamatory passage in a speech or poem”.If you’d like a further example of why apostrophes are their ilk can matter, see below.108th over: India 358-5 (Pujara 165, Pant 16) Pujara is making it look so easy. Works the ball to leg a couple of times, straight to the field, but the last ball of the over Lyon gives him width, and Pujara immediately changes his line of attack to cut behind point for four.107th over: India 353-5 (Pujara 161, Pant 15) Starc attempts the yorker at 151 kph. Just overpitches. Pant is doing the hornpipe to get his feet out of the way of the very low full toss, but gets enough on it to send it down the ground. It rolls and rolls and teases Hazlewood all the way into the rope.106th over: India 346-5 (Pujara 160, Pant 9) Huge appeal, and Australia will go upstairs again. Pant swishes outside off stump and Lyon’s ball misses the top edge. There was a noise, you can hear a click as the ball goes past on the stump mics. “I didn’t hear anything. You guys know,” says Lyon. Khawaja at slip says “That’s out.” Paine reviews. But there’s nothing on DRS or Snicko, and it seems like a sliver of daylight between ball and bat. The noise must have come from somewhere else. More frustration, and Australia have now lost both reviews.105th over: India 345-5 (Pujara 160, Pant 8) Mitchell Starc, ladies and gentlemen, is getting smashed. Pujara is the more attacking player right at the moment, and cover drives gorgeously for four. Starc comes over the wicket to the left-handed Pant, and produces the same result in mirror image, that ball so well struck it flew to the rope where plenty of others have limped. A single to each batsman means 10 from the over. 104th over: India 335-5 (Pujara 155, Pant 3) A maiden from Nathan Lyon to Rishabh Pant. Now I’ve seen everything. (“Oh really? Have you ever seen a man eat his own head? Well then you haven’t seen everything.”) Pant plays a couple of shots to the field, but otherwise defends and leaves. Wonder if he made a New Year’s resolution to stop holding out for 24 from 18 balls.Ruth wishes to clarify that her former post was indeed satirical, and she’d like to wager that Pujara will be the not-out batsman. Safe shout.103rd over: India 335-5 (Pujara 155, Pant 3) Right. Pants on, everybody. Pant’s on. Off the mark immediately as he deals with Starc’s yorker. Then dabs a single. Pujara adds another couple on the glance. Now it’s time for drinks.102nd over: India 329-5 (Pujara 152) Down the track he comes to Lyon, shimmying as he did all yesterday, and drives with a flourish out through cover for four. The tumbling save out on the rope saves nothing. And another milestone comes up for Pujara, his biggest hundred of the series by a distance now. But when he swaps strike, Vihari is out to the last ball of the over.Finally the breakthrough for Lyon. Vihari goes for the sweep, gets the faintest top edge, into his bicep, and flexed away to short leg. Vihari didn’t think he hit it, and reviewed immediately, but Snicko found the faintest flicker. More evidence that “you always know when you’ve hit it” is self-confirming tosh.101st over: India 324-4 (Pujara 147, Vihari 42) Starc on to complete a double change. Did I mention that Che likes the cut shot? Short, wide, dross, boshed. Starc gets the line better, and later in the over almost has Vihari playing onto his stumps. Got his legs in the way, luckily for the batsman.100th over: India 319-4 (Pujara 142, Vihari 42) Lyon on for a trundle. Vihari blocks out the over watchfully. Checking for any turn or bounce from this surface. Doesn’t look threatening yet.Abramowitz tips Pujara for 253.Geoff Wignall for 177.And the pool is closed.99th over: India 319-4 (Pujara 142, Vihari 42) Pujara has been sharp on the threes today. Gets another from Hazlewood off his pads, thereby sadly knocking Josh (not Hazlewood) out of the running for the pool before even getting started.“Pujara to fall for 139 top edging a reverse sweep. It’s later revealed this was part of a bet with fellow jokester and bloke who thinks it’s important to remember cricket’s just a game, Virat Kohli.”98th over: India 315-4 (Pujara 139, Vihari 41) Pujara finally takes a run from Cummins via a cut shot. Moves his score on to 139. So then.Andrew Benton has gone for 192. “I think he’ll have a brainstorm in a little bit.” You think he’ll put some butcher’s paper up on the wall and get out the felt-tip markers and write up some ideas? Real blue-sky thinking? What if we had no budgetary constraints? What do we stand for as an organisation? What brings us joy, and how can we best bring joy to others? Worthy stuff.Gerard is going with 198. Paul has 401.97th over: India 314-4 (Pujara 138, Vihari 41) Another maiden, as the waiting game continues. Vihari has not yet decided that he’d rather play Hungry Hungry Hippos. He has to play at four Hazlewood deliveries, but all defensive strokes. “Hi Geoff. These guys need to be bounced out methinks.” I do hope that’s satirical, Ruth, after what we saw yesterday morning.96th over: India 314-4 (Pujara 138, Vihari 41) Another Cummins maiden to Pujara. Jono Maher has a very interesting question.“I wonder if that list of top visiting run-scorers against Australia warrants some unpacking? By my reckoning all 15 entries come exclusively from England or India. Is that simply a function of the number of series played, or the effect of a few stand-out iniduals, or something else perhaps? India in particular have never won a series in Australia, yet claim 7 of the top 15 highest spots, whereas the West Indies I believe have won 4 series here, and don’t feature at all...”Not something I necessarily have time to unpack while doing the OBO, so please feel free to write in. Off the top of my head: yes, England have played far more series than anyone else, so have had more opportunities to get on the list. Also those series have been five or six Tests for a long time, where most countries visiting Aus play two or three. India did play some five-Test series, and even when it dropped to four they had that generation of prolific batsmen who went huge when they went big. West Indies is the big anomaly, as you say. Perhaps they won Tests by batting once, or didn’t need more than about 200 themselves because they could bowl other teams out for 120?95th over: India 314-4 (Pujara 138, Vihari 41) Both batsmen are starting to drive Hazlewood confidently. Can he use this against them? Vihari picks up two and then one, Pujara another three. What’s the pool on Pujara’s score today? I’m tipping 232. Nominations close after the 100th over. Closest to the pin. 94th over: India 308-4 (Pujara 135, Vihari 39) Cummins in contrast takes the Route 1 approach, attacking the body. He’s got that leg gully in again, trying to replicate the dismissal of Pujara from Melbourne. Slightly different circumstances though this time around, and Pujara is happy not to score. We might as well crack into the politics of the day, via Bill May. “‘I don’t play for NSW’ used to be the lament of fine cricketers not selected in the Australian team. Now it’s ‘I’m not the kind of bloke the selectors are looking for.’ Time to remove politics from the selection process as in the PM’s assurance, ‘Have a go and you’ll get a go.’”Not sure that Kirribilli is where I’d be looking for pointers on stable administrative process right at the moment, but the sentiment largely holds.93rd over: India 308-4 (Pujara 135, Vihari 39) Hazlewood, first thing in the morning, with a ball that’s still fairly new. This is how he did in England in Adelaide a year and a bit ago. How much longer it seems... He beats Vihari with a good ball, but Australia’s bowlers have done a lot of that this series, and far less dismissing anyone. Hazlewood can’t change that, even as he chisels away just outside off stump. Vihari’s discipline holds.92nd over: India 308-4 (Pujara 135, Vihari 39) Pat Cummins will start the day: Simon Atkinson will be happy. “Long time reader, first time caller. Having a particularly busy morning at work and knocked up this masterpiece (attached) for a group chat, but hoping it’s an omen for Cummins bring the spice (cumin?) to India today. Not sure I’ve got the meme right, but... I’m too old to understand memes. Thanks for the commentary yesterday, looking forward to a good morning of cricket for either team.”Pujara blocks out the over tamely enough, bar two runs off his pads.91st over: India 306-4 (Pujara 133, Vihari 39) And we’re away. Hazlewood with the first ball, defended, then the second ball, driven nicely by Pujara through covers for three. The bat twisted on impact there, but it was nice decisive footwork from the overnight batsman to get to the line of that ball. Vihari is tucked up on his stumps and tries to punch into the gap at point, but can’t beat the field. It’s Day 2, so the Richies are out in force. Gathering at the pub across the road before the game as I walked in. Already in good voice. Though drunkenly yelling at passing cars at 9:30 in the morning wasn’t exactly the vibe that the great man exuded, if I’m bluntly honest. Let’s see how they go in the stands today.And while we finish our morning Pujara Party, why not take some of the 25 minutes before play to read my piece from last night, in which I got to cite some beautifully accidental modern Australian poetry from South Australia bowler Nick Benton.While Ric Finlay is doing the business (he’s the ABC statto, and one of the best in the world), how’s this for a number?This gives a good sense of Pujara’s series. Dominant in terms of decent scores per innings, but nothing gargantuan. Currently 15th on this list, though he could vault up a fair few places today. Plus a second innings if necessary.As always, drop me a line. We’ve had a fair bit of fun with the readers this series, who’ve come out of the woodwork more and more as the Tests have gone on. Find me on Twitter if that’s your bag, or use the old and elegant email: geoff.lemon@the.Good morning, good evening, good crepuscular stroll, good whatever time of day or night it is in your locale. Perhaps you’re orbiting in a satellite and the very concepts of day and night are now irrelevant? In which case, welcome, space family! And a salute for your post-atmospheric bravery.It is Cheteshwar Pujara day at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Three hundreds so far in this four-Test series, but he hasn’t made a monster. And he, like Dr Frankenstein before him, loves making monsters. Then suggesting to us by reflection that perhaps the real monster was within us all along?Che Pu is on 130, he has the No6 Hanuma Vihari for company, he has the wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant and the all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja to come, before the batting thins out down the order, and he has a pretty nice batting surface to operate on. So today could be all his. He could carpe the hell out of that diem.Alternatively, Australia desperately need to knock him over early. India have passed 300 already, and that already looks very challenging for Australia’s struggling line-up. No time to waste."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdd81c1fed967d22b1313ada8b4cb3d71e5c5b4d/0_57_4536_2721/master/4536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c990d7c50d49303227cead14f9d7285","title":"apple woes go far beyond slowdown in chinese economy","story":"Higher price tags, competition, cultural differences and saturation in the west have led to longer replacement cyclesApple’s cut in its sales forecast was blamed almost entirely on the economic slowdown in China, but the real picture is probably far more complex, with high prices, cultural differences, fierce competition and consumers keeping their phones for longer all causing problems.Its chief executive, Tim Cook, said falling sales of iPhone, iPads and computers were primarily due to the “magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in greater China”.While the downturn in China is a factor, Apple faces challenges in the west too. Smartphone ownership in the US and EU has reached saturation point and convincing people to upgrade from models that still work is far harder than attracting first-time buyers. People are holding on to their old iPhones for longer than ever. The average time people keep hold of them has risen from 18 months to up to three years.That has meant Apple finding long-term revenue services such as the App Store and Apple Pay, and increasing the purchase price of the phones.The iPhone X raised the price ceiling of a top-end mainstream smartphone to £1,000 in 2017, and a year later the XS Max pushed it up to as much as £1,449.“In mature affluent markets such as the US, in western Europe and South Korea, there is still a willingness to pay a significant premium for an iPhone,” said Ben Wood, head of research at CCS Insight.But the higher prices have undoubtedly hit more price-conscious consumers. “The bulk of the iPhone user base may not be ready to shell out $1,200+ for base iPhone models which used to cost $699 just a few years ago,” said Neil Shah, a partner at Counterpoint Research. “Not all of the hundreds of millions of Apple iPhone user base are affluent.”The increasing cost of iPhones may lead to even longer replacement cycles. Apple is clearly aware of the problem, offering trade-in discounts at the end of 2018. The firm has also been pushing consumers towards instalment plans in the US.The lock-in associated with Apple-exclusive services such as iMessage, Apple Photos and even the App Store, means the iPhone is not just another interchangeable smartphone in the US and many parts of Europe.That isn’t the case in China. No one smartphone dominates, and services are device agnostic. WeChat, for example, is far more than just a communications medium and social network like Facebook and WhatsApp it is where 1 billion Chinese go for news, access to government services, to conduct business, pay for goods and services, and even to order a taxi.“Unlike the rest of the world, in China the most important layer of the smartphone stack is not the phone’s operating system. Rather, it is WeChat,” wrote the technology analyst Ben Thompson in 2017. “For all intents and purposes WeChat is your phone, and to a far greater extent in China than anywhere else, your phone is everything.”Thompson’s view is just as true now. There is little advantage in China to running iOS over Android on your phone. WeChat runs just as well on either, levelling the playing field.Apple is still premium-brand luxury, but it is only as good as its last smartphone. In China it comes up against local rivals such as Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi which not only match but exceed the iPhone, and at a far lower price. Huawei is now the second biggest smartphone maker in the world and its devices can cost as little as half as much as Apple’s.“Chinese brands are outcompeting and out-marketing Apple on design, mobile-first innovations and value ,” said Shah.But the biggest issue for Apple is the importance of China to its future growth. Having effectively been priced out of India, which is one of the world’s smartphone markets that is still growing, China is crucial – and as a trade war between Washington and Beijing looms, Apple’s problems could get worse."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49eef654dbe73fa10866e6bad1b711547461df4f/1_0_3870_2323/master/3870.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7303695388b7dd7d02fc313a814e779c","title":"how can you tell if a mobile phone has good reception before you buy it","story":"Paul lives in a signal black spot where his wife’s smartphone still works. Is there a way to find if phone has good reception?I have a Moto 3 smartphone and my wife has a similar earlier model. We are right on the edge of reception from EE. I can just get a very weak signal if I attach my phone to a selfie stick and lean out of a window, or walk up the bank behind the house. This is not ideal.Away from home, sometimes my wife’s phone can get a strong signal whereas mine can’t get a signal at all. This made me wonder if there was a measurement to assess how good a mobile phone is at receiving signals in areas of poor reception before you buy it … and if there is an easy way for an ordinary punter to understand it. PaulPhone manufacturers and others can and do test their phones, usually for certification purposes. The performance test results you want, if you can get them, are the Total Isotropic Sensitivity (TIS) value for reception and the Total Radiated Power (TRP) for transmission.These probably don’t qualify as easy for an ordinary punter to understand. Also, they are derived by testing performance in ideal conditions with a simulated base station in an anechoic chamber, not with a fading signal on a wet and windy hillside.Either way, I don’t think phone manufacturers are likely to use TIS in their marketing. There are too many variables for it to be a reliable guide to real-world reception. For example, studies have found significant differences between holding a phone in the left hand and holding it in the right hand, which I assume is connected with the way manufacturers position their antenna(s). The size of your hands and the angle at which you hold the phone also make a difference.The tests were created by the CTIA – originally the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association – to certify wireless devices’ over-the-air performance, and a brief glance at the 591-page PDF will show how complicated it is. For example, you could measure peak performance with a directional aerial, but then users would have to orient the phone towards the unseen transmitter for the best results. Instead, the CTIA requires the “average spherical effective radiated receiver sensitivity (TIS) to be measured”. This should mean a phone works equally well in all directions, but it’s complicated to calculate and still a compromise.Another problem is making antennas work with different 2G, 3G and 4G phone networks that operate at different frequencies. A phone that works well with GSM 900 might be terrible with UMTS 2100. The downside of having a phone that talks to most networks is that it won’t be optimised for the one you actually use.Also, because human bodies have not been standardised, TIS and TRP measurements are made with dummy heads and hands filled with liquid. Results may vary if you use real people.In the end, the only measurements that matter are the ones you get with your head and hands with the specific frequencies used by your EE network. We are left with “ask a friend” and the not-very-helpful “try it and see”.I couldn’t find much public research into mobile phone reception with commercial phones, presumably because of some of the problems mentioned above. Professor Gert Frølund Pedersen tested nine phones in Denmark in 2012 (PDF), while in the UK, Ofcom used the CTIA test to check 10 off-the-shelf phones in 2016 (PDF).Ofcom withheld the names of the phones it tested because there weren’t enough samples to show statistically significant differences – it tested three of each device – and because “no handset outperformed the others across different frequency bands and technologies”. Knowing the names would therefore not help consumers.However, Ofcom did point out that the non-smartphones outperformed the smartphones, and that “some of the smartphones tested required over 10x (10dB) more power than the best performing non-smartphone”.You could always buy a cheap Nokia for making voice calls.Last year, Ireland’s ComReg (Commission for Communications Regulation) tested 71 mobile phones that were available on the Irish market in June 2017. The aim was to “quantify the minimum signal level(s) required to make or receive a mobile call and to stream data” (PDF).ComReg names names and gives results, but only for TRP (active transmission) not TIS (reception). It doesn’t explain why. The CTIA test recommends that TRP and TIS are tested concurrently, because a phone’s internal components (processor, memory and so on) generate electrical noise that affects reception.StellaDoradus has published a table of the results, which includes some strikingly low numbers for some popular phones. I wouldn’t use it as the sole basis for a purchasing decision.Most tests assume that all models of a particular phone will perform in the same way, but Ofcom found differences. As with other products, phones that look identical can vary. In some cases, they may have been assembled in different countries, and use slightly different components. In others, the circuitry may have been revised between editions. Even if the internal components seem to be the same, there could be some sample variation, without a phone actually being faulty.This makes me wonder if your Moto 3 is below average in reception performance. In most cases, no one would ever know, but you are literally an “edge case”. With a new phone, it might be worth asking the supplier for a different sample, but it may be too late for that.It would be interesting to know what would happen if you swapped phones and sims with your wife. You may have a bigger capacitance than your wife, electronically speaking, and possibly much bigger hands. Both can and do affect reception. If your Moto 3 works better in her hands, then either you or your sim are degrading the performance. It might be worth getting a new sim.As you already know, using your phone on a selfie stick can improve performance. You may also get better reception by not touching the phone and using the built-in speakerphone.You could also try using a signal booster or repeater. These used to be illegal, but on 12 April last year, Ofcom approved the use of some models in homes and road vehicles “but not in boats or static caravans”. However, check carefully because illegal signal boosters are still available.Have you got a question?

We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

In total, she suffered 15 Democratic defections, mostly from new members who pledged to oppose her during their campaigns and from old foes who have long called for new leadership.When the tally was announced, Democrats erupted in applause. Several members embraced Pelosi as her grandchildren, who were seated on the chamber floor, bounced up and down with excitement. In reclaiming the gavel, Pelosi, who had previously served as speaker from 2007-2011, became the first former speaker to win re-election since Sam Rayburn in 1955.She then swore into office the 116th Congress, which includes a record 102 women. The incoming freshman class is the youngest and most racially erse in history, with a number of outspoken members prepared to take on Donald Trump.“Our nation is at a historic moment,” Pelosi said in her remarks on the House floor. “Two months ago, the American people spoke and demanded a new dawn.”Among the special guests watching from the audience were singer Tony Bennett, Mickey Hart, drummer of the Grateful Dead and fashion consultant Tim Gunn. Pelosi’s supporters wore pins that said “Madame Speaker”.To secure her ascent, Pelosi defused an attempt to block her nomination with a series of concessions to opponents, including pledging to support term limits for serving as speaker. In doing so, she won over key dissenters such as Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged her in 2016.Others took a different tack. Andy Kim, a newly elected Democrat from New Jersey who said he would not support Pelosi on the campaign trail but flipped on Thursday, told reporters: “I’m approaching every vote on what I think is going to be best for people of Burlington and Ocean county. So when I approach the vote, I think about what I can get for that vote for my people either way.”The opposition to Pelosi manifested itself in different ways. Three Democrats voted present (including the newly elected Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, who first attempted to vote “no”, which was not an option).Others backed a variety of candidates. There were three votes for the incoming Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) chair, Cheri Bustos of Illinois, two for Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and other votes cast for politicians such as the former vice-president Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams, the losing Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Georgia.But for the most part, she received enthusiastic endorsements from the Democrats. Several congresswomen dedicated their vote for Pelosi to the young women who will come after them. Congresswoman Lucy McBath said she would vote for Pelosi in honor of her son Jordan, who was fatally shot in Florida. A new member from Texas, Veronica Escobar, enthusiastically voted for “Nancy ‘No Wall’ Pelosi” while others cheered for “NDP” – the initials for Nancy D’Alesandro Pelosi.One Democratic aide hailed Pelosi as a “mastermind” for her comfortable win and said: “All of us are amazed by how easy today’s vote will be for her.”The aide noted, however, that unlike Pelosi’s first stint as speaker, “managing this caucus will be more difficult than back in 2007”.In their first act after officially taking control of the House of Representatives on Thursday, Democrats intend to test their power in a newly ided Washington by passing legislation to end a partial government shutdown that is entering its 13th day.Though the vote on the proposed funding legislation is unlikely to break the impasse over the shutdown – Trump formally pledged to veto it in an official White House statement Thursday – it sets the tone for what is expected to be a tumultuous final two years of the president’s first term.The 2019-20 Congress begins work on Thursday with roughly a quarter of the federal government closed, affecting 800,000 employees, in a shutdown triggered by Trump’s demand last month for the money for a wall along the US-Mexican border – opposed by Democrats – as part of any legislation to fund government agencies.Trump started Thursday by blaming Democrats for the impasse, calling their opposition to a wall “strictly politics”.He wrote on Twitter: “The Shutdown is only because of the 2020 Presidential Election. The Democrats know they can’t win based on all of the achievements of ‘Trump,’ so they are going all out on the desperately needed Wall and Border Security – and Presidential Harassment. For them, strictly politics!”Trump had previously said he would be “proud” to shut down the government to secure funding to build a physical barrier along America’s southern border.During a contentious meeting with top congressional leaders in the White House Situation Room on Wednesday, Trump said the shutdown could last “a long time” and promised to reject any offer that did not include billions in taxpayer dollars for a wall, despite the fact that he has repeatedly stated Mexico would be forced to pay for it.Pelosi’s spending package would fund most of the federal government through the end of September and the Department of Homeland Security until 8 February.The bill would allocate $1.3bn for border security measures, such as increased surveillance and fencing, but would deny Trump’s demand for $5.6bn to build 200 miles of fencing along the 2,000-mile border with Mexico.At a press conference on Thursday, Pelosi implored Trump to take “yes for an answer”, noting that the bills had previously drawn overwhelming support from Senate Republicans. However, she insisted “we’re not doing a wall” and described Trump’s signature proposal as “an immorality”.If the House sends the bills to the Senate, which remains under Republican control, it will need 60 votes to advance. Last month, the Senate easily passed legislation that would have funded the government through 8 February without money for Trump’s border wall. However the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has pledged not to put the legislation on the floor, describing it as “political theater not productive policymaking”.

There are a number of former members of the military and intelligence services, many of them women. There are seasoned veterans of past presidential administrations and a handful of political neophytes who never held office before running for Congress in 2018.A record 102 women were sworn into the House on Thursday, 35 of whom were elected for the first time in November in a historic wave of success for female candidates.“We’re in the building. Swearing in tomorrow,” the congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York captioned a photograph of her and five incoming female colleagues, posing in the US Capitol.The arrival of this large new group will significantly alter the balance of power in Washington, where the federal government is currently paralysed by a shutdown stretching into its 13th day.Democrats regained control of the House on Thursday eight years after losing power. Their takeover was fuelled by 63 Democrats whose victories in the November midterm elections helped the party win by the largest margins since the Watergate scandal in 1974.Nancy Pelosi reclaimed her former title as speaker of the House. She made history in 2007 as the first woman to hold the position, before handing over the gavel when the GOP won the House in 2011. The Republicans will be led by Kevin McCarthy of California.“I think of it is a responsibility,” Pelosi told Today when asked how she felt about being the most powerful woman in Washington. “I don’t think of it as an accomplishment … This isn’t breaking a glass ceiling – this is breaking a marble ceiling in the Capitol of the United States.”Pelosi became one of few elected officials to regain the gavel, and the first for more than 50 years.“When our new members take the oath, our Congress will be refreshed and our democracy will be strengthened by the optimism, idealism and patriotism of this transformative freshman class,” Pelosi said on Thursday. “Working together, we will redeem the promise of the American dream for every family, advancing progress for every community.”As in years past, proud relatives and curious members of the public filled the House and Senate galleries as the 116th Congress was sworn in and new leaders were elected. But this year the faces look different – more erse and more female.Rashida Tlaib, an incoming Democratic congresswoman from Michigan, announced on Instagram that she would wear a traditional Palestinian thobe – a long-sleeved, ankle-length garment – when being sworn in. Ilhan Omar, an incoming Democratic congresswoman from Minnesota, swore the oath of office on her grandfather’s Qur’an.In an Instagram post, her father recounted the family’s journey from a refugee camp in Kenya to the US, where they first arrived at an “airport in Washington DC”.“I could never have dreamed that 23 years later I would return to the same airport with my daughter Ilhan by my side, the day before she is to be sworn in as the first Somali-American elected to the United States Congress,” he wrote.Congressman Jim Langevin, a Democrat from Rhode Island and the first quadriplegic person elected to Congress, presided over the chamber on the first day.After the speaker was elected, the newly empowered Democratic majority was due to vote on an internal rules package designed to bring more transparency to congressional governance, a measure that has already exposed ideological tensions within the party. Two prominent progressives, Ocasio-Cortez and Congressman Ro Khanna of California, said they would oppose the package, arguing that the rules would hinder liberals’ ability to advance their ambitious social agenda.Democrats will then turn to their first major order of business: a spending package that would end the government shutdown.The party is unified on the legislation but Donald Trump has said he will refuse to sign the bill, which does not include funding for his border wall.The vote will be the first test of their power – and an indication of the battles to come in a newly ided government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af24f4769acc653c32759678792c85556c63c879/465_930_2341_1404/master/2341.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a445ee97211918934720545db3592659","title":"seaching for scrap in guatemala city in pictures","story":"Workers known as guajeros descend daily to search for recyclable items at one of the biggest rubbish dumps in Guatemala City.

File photograph: Getty ImagesThe Government estimates that the cost of a scheme to compensate women caught up in the CervicalCheck controversy for the non-disclosure of the results of a smear test audit could be between €5 million and €15 million.The cost is based on the State’s contribution of €25,000 to one case which was settled out of court. The scheme applies to compensation only for cases of accepted non-disclosure for the 221 women and families involved in the controversy.While the Government has been told it is difficult to estimate exactly how much such a scheme would cost, the benchmark comparison of the case settled out of court was used in recent briefings to Ministers.The €25,000 payout was made in respect of the issue of non-disclosure and to avoid further legal costs, it is understood.The anticipated payouts would be made under a non-statutory ex-gratia compensation scheme where the State accepts non-disclosure.However, the acceptance of such a sum would not preclude any women from pursuing other legal claims, although any further awards for non-disclosure would be subtracted by the amount granted under the ex-gratia scheme.The State’s liability in the CervicalCheck cases is mainly said to be limited to issues of non-disclosure. This element has been separated from the substantive claim of reading the smear samples, and issues between CervicalCheck and the laboratories, so the issue of non-disclosure can be fast-tracked.It is anticipated that laboratories involved in reading smear tests would be liable for any incorrect reading of smear tests.The Government decided before Christmas to set up an independent statutory tribunal to deal with claims arising from the CervicalCheck controversy. It is intended that the tribunal will provide a less adversarial approach than pursuing cases via the courts. Hearings are expected to be held in private. Ms Justice Mary Irvine will chair the tribunal, which will be set up in late 2019 and will be voluntary for all parties.Minister for Heath Simon Harris is also expected to appoint another retired judge to administer the separate ex-gratia scheme, and the judge will have the discretion to decide the level of payment per woman. The recent estimates given to Ministers were indicative only, it is understood.Instead of the wider tribunal, one option that was considered was an adapted High Court process to deal with just CervicalCheck cases. This would not have been voluntary and it was argued privately that it would have avoided risks associated with a tribunal. These risks include its remit expanding to include all medical negligence claims, which would make such a tribunal potentially permanent in nature. However, this was rejected in favour of a tribunal.Private briefings also acknowledged that the voluntary nature of the proposed tribunal may prove to be a disadvantage if laboratories concerned decline to participate in anything less than a formal court process."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3747252.1546554267!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu clarifications could help may sell withdrawal deal says varadkar","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar speaks to the media following the first Cabinet meeting of 2019 at Government Buildings, Dublin, on Thursday. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe It would be “helpful” if European Union leaders knew what clarifications they could offer on the Brexit withdrawal agreement that would assist UK prime minister Theresa May pass the deal through the House of Commons, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.Speaking after a phone call with German chancellor Angela Merkel, the Taoiseach said they both agreed to stand by the Brexit withdrawal agreement and discussed how to help Mrs May pass the deal in the House of Commons.Separately, almost 1,000 police officers from England and Scotland are to begin training for deployment in Northern Ireland in case of disorder from a no-deal Brexit, according to a report in .The plans were put in place after Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) chiefs asked for reinforcements to deal with any trouble that arises from a hard border. The training for officers from English forces and Police Scotland is expected to begin this month.The prospect of large numbers of English and Scottish officers being deployed on the streets of Northern Ireland after March 29th could complicate efforts to restore the power-sharing executive at Stormont, which collapsed in 2017.The option of reinforcements is deemed necessary to cover the possibility of civil disorder arising from disquiet about Border arrangements that could be put in place after a hard Brexit.The PSNI request was made under mutual aid arrangements, which are in place to enable local police forces to help each other in times of heightened demands.On Thursday, Mr Varadkar said while the EU could offer assurances and clarifications to the UK, nothing could “contradict or change” the withdrawal agreement struck in November, including the backstop.The backstop, the insurance policy to avoid a hard border in Ireland even if there is no future EU-UK trade deal next March, is the main impediment to Mrs May getting the deal passed in Westminster. MPs are due to vote on the deal in the middle of the month.There have been calls from the United Kingdom for clarifications that the backstop will be temporary, and Mr Varadkar has said it was always only meant to hold “unless and until” a future trade deal that avoids a hard border is in place.“What would be helpful for us as EU prime ministers and presidents would be to know what clarifications would be enough to secure a majority in the House of Commons but always understanding that clarifications, understandings, guarantees, explanations cannot go against the spirit or render inoperable parts of the withdrawal agreement,” he said.“We need to know what the United Kingdom parliament wants in terms of those guarantees and those clarifications. This is something we will have to see develop over the next week or two.”Mr Varadkar said he and Ms Merkel spoke for about 40 minutes at the chancellor’s request. They also spoke about planning for a no-deal scenario, which was also discussed by the Cabinet in Dublin on Thursday.At the Cabinet meeting on January 15th, Minister for Health Simon Harris and Minister for Transport Shane Ross will give detailed outlines of planning for the supply of medicines and in the transport sector if the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal in March. Other ministers will follow at subsequent meetings.The Taoiseach said that the 45 pieces of legislation needed for a no-deal Brexit outcome will be condensed into four large Bills. If needed, time would be cleared in the Dáil and Seanad in March for such legislation rather than have both Houses “tied up” in January and February, the Taoiseach said.On the issue of State aid in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the Taoiseach said the Government would largely be asking the EU for “State aid clearance”.“Us being allowed to use our own money to support companies, businesses and farmers who are adversely affected by Brexit,” he said.Mr Varadkar will travel to Bavaria on Friday to address the annual gathering of the Christian Social Union, the regional sister party of Ms Merkel’s national Christian Democratic Union."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3747008.1546533512!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nostalgia for deutschmark fades as germans accept euro","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA customer pays for a hot dog in Frankfurt at the start of  2002.

Photograph: EPAUK prime minister’s officeMore than half of grassroots Conservative members want British prime minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal to be ditched in favour of no deal, a survey has found.About 57 per cent of the rank-and-file are convinced that leaving the EU without a deal is better than their own leader’s Brexit plan, according to a poll funded by the UK’s Economic and Social Research Council.Less than a quarter (23 per cent) would vote for Mrs May’s deal in a three-way referendum between the deal, no deal and remaining in the EU.The latest findings are bad news for Mrs May’s hopes of winning support for her deal, said research leader Prof Tim Bale. “If Theresa May is hoping that her MPs will return to Westminster having been persuaded by their constituency associations to back her Brexit deal, she’s going to be disappointed,” he said.“It appears that those members are in no mood for compromise. Moreover, the Tory rank-and-file, it seems, are convinced that no deal is better than May’s deal.”Prof Bale added: “Tory members’ dislike for the PM’s deal really comes out when we asked about a referendum in which the choice came down to her deal or no deal. Only 29 per cent of Tory members would vote for Mrs May’s deal, compared to 64 per cent who would vote to leave without a deal.“But that’s as nothing to Conservative Party members faced with a referendum offering just two choices – remain or no deal. Some 76 per cent of Conservative Party members would plump for no deal.”He said there were two specific issues behind the opposition to Mrs May’s deal, the first being the Irish backstop.“Tory members have become convinced that the Irish backstop is a bad idea,” he said. The survey, he pointed out, found that that 40 per cent of Conservative Party members thought the backstop was a reason in itself to reject a deal, while 21 per cent thought it was irrelevant because Mrs May’s deal “is a bad one anyway”.The backstop is a mechanism to ensure there is no hard Border in Ireland after Brexit.The second issue was that 76 per cent of members believed warnings that a no-deal Brexit would cause serious disruption were “exaggerated or invented”.“Tory members – like Tory voters – are utterly unconvinced, despite their own government’s best recent efforts – that a no-deal Brexit would cause serious disruption,” said Prof Bale. “Some 72 per cent of voters currently intending to support the Conservatives think the warnings are ‘exaggerated or invented’ – a figure that rises to 76 per cent among Tory members.“Meanwhile, those members are convinced by a margin of 64 per cent to 19 per cent that leaving without a deal would have a positive rather than a negative effect on Britain’s economy in the medium to long term.”Nearly half (48 per cent) of Tory members think Mrs May is doing fairly badly or very badly as prime minister, and 44 per cent think she should quit if parliament votes to reject her deal.“In short, Mrs May has failed not only to convince the country, and quite probably parliament, that her Brexit deal is a good one, she has also failed to convince the party faithful,” Prof Bale said. “If anything, grassroots Tories are even less impressed than Tory MPs.“If some of those MPs can be persuaded to back the prime minister’s deal, it won’t be because they’ve come under pressure to do so from their local party members over the Christmas break.” – PA"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

though some suggest these figures are an overestimate.But in the first study to track the strain of cholera responsible for the outbreak, scientists using genome sequencing have found that migration is behind the introduction of the disease into the country.The strain originated in South Asia in 2012, according to the research published in Nature journal on Tuesday, but spread to Yemen from East Africa. Yemen has long been a crossroads for trade and communications between Africa and Asia, and the current epidemic is closely linked to recent outbreaks in Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya. Cholera is a diarrhoeal disease, transmitted through contaminated food and water, which is most prevalent in regions with poor sanitation. In Yemen, where there has been more than three years of conflict, around 16 million of the 29 million inhabitants have no access to safe water and basic sanitation. “We know that a lack of sanitation and hygiene, population displacement and war are directly linked to large-scale outbreaks,” said Professor Nick Thomson, one of the report’s lead authors. “The difference is that we now know that it’s the movement of the bacterial agent causing cholera across and between countries that links these large-scale outbreaks together.”“In the past we have considered that we are in essence victims to fortune for local pools of the bacterium causing cholera, but we now have a new window into the disease,” he added. Prof Thomson said the research will allow better targeted interventions against cholera and help estimate the risk of future outbreaks in regions like Yemen -potentially reducing the impact of future epidemics. But the researchers, from the Wellcome Sanger Institute and Institut Pasteur, also found that the strain in Yemen is more susceptible to antibiotics than other types of cholera. “Surprisingly, we discovered the cholera strain causing the Yemen outbreaks is less resistant to antibiotics than related strains,” said Dr Daryl Domman, a visiting scientist at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. “The strain causing the Yemeni cholera epidemic has deleted four genes responsible for resistance to clinically relevant antibiotics, making itself more vulnerable to treatment.”Newsletter promotion -

or the dark side - is never visible from Earth. Previous spacecraft have seen the far side of the moon, but none has landed on it.The landing lifted the mysterious veil from the far side of the moon, and opened a new chapter in human lunar exploration, the broadcaster said. China launched the Chang\u0027e-4 probe earlier this month, carried by a Long March-3B rocket. It includes a lander and a rover to explore the surface of the moon.An image taken by China\u0026#39s Chang\u0026#39e-4 probe after its landingThe far side of the moon is a rare quiet place that is free from interference of radio signals from Earth, mission spokesman Yu Guobin said, according to Xinhua. This probe can fill the gap of low-frequency observation in radio astronomy and will provide important information for studying the origin of stars and nebula evolution.Unlike the near side of the moon that offers many flat areas to touch down on, the far side is mountainous and rugged.The tasks of the Chang\u0027e-4 include astronomical observation, surveying the moon\u0027s terrain, landform and mineral composition, and measuring the neutron radiation and neutral atoms to study the environment on the far side of the moon.The near side (l) and far side (r) of the Moon show marked differencesChina aims to catch up with Russia and the United States to become a major space power by 2030. It is planning to launch construction of its own manned space station next year.However, while China has insisted its ambitions are purely peaceful, the US Defence Department has accused it of pursuing activities aimed at preventing other nations from using space-based assets during a crisis.Apart from its civilian ambitions, Beijing has tested anti-satellite missiles and the US Congress has banned Nasa from bilateral cooperation with its Chinese counterpart due to security concerns.A simulated landing process of Chang\u0026#39e-4 lunar probe is seen through the monitor at Beijing Aerospace Control Center in BeijingThe United States is so far the only country to have landed humans on the moon. US President Donald Trump said in 2017 he wants to return astronauts to the lunar surface and establish a foundation there for an eventual mission to Mars.It was not until 1959 that the Soviet Union captured the first images of the moon\u0027s mysterious and heavily cratered dark side.No lander or rover has ever previously touched the surface there, and it is no easy technological feat - China has been preparing for this moment for years.The first image of the moon\u0026#39s far side taken by China\u0026#39s Chang\u0026#39e-4 probeA major challenge for such a mission was communicating with the robotic lander: as there is no direct line of sight for signals to the far side of the moon.As a solution, China in May blasted the Queqiao (Magpie Bridge) satellite into the moon\u0027s orbit, positioning it at a \u0027Lagrange point\u0027 so that it can relay data and commands between the lander and Earth.A Lagrange point is a location in space where the combined gravitational forces of two large bodies, such as Earth and the sun or Earth and the moon, equal the centrifugal force felt by a much smaller third body. The interaction of the forces creates a point of equilibrium where a spacecraft may be parked to make observations.In another extreme hurdle, during the lunar night - which lasts 14 Earth days - temperatures drop to as low as minus 173 degrees Celsius (minus 279 Fahrenheit).Long March-3B rocket carrying Chang\u0026#39e 4 lunar probe takes off from the Xichang Satellite Launch CentreDuring the lunar day, also lasting 14 Earth days, temperatures soar as high as 127 C (261 F).The rover\u0027s instruments have to withstand those fluctuations and it has to generate enough energy to sustain it during the long night.The pioneering landing demonstrates China\u0027s growing ambitions as a space power. In 2013, Chang\u0027e 3 was the first spacecraft to land on the moon since the Soviet Union\u0027s Luna 24 in 1976.China plans to send its Chang\u0027e 5 probe to the moon next year and have it return to Earth with samples - the first time that will have been done since 1976. Please review our commenting policyWhat happens if Donald Trump is impeached – and who would be the next president?What is impeachment and how long does the process take?Councils urged to price motorists off road by NHS watchdogGirls who spend over three hours on social media twice as likely to suffer depressionMost Tory members would choose a no-deal Brexit over Theresa May\u0026#39s plan, poll showsChina poses greatest threat to UK as global super-power, claims new studyComment: Armed build-up means extraterrestrial warfare no longer in the realm of fantasyPatients forced to wait twice as long when GP calls for paramedics Watch out on Sunday, it\u0026#39s the deadliest time of the yearChildren \u0026#39should not be allowed screentime for an hour before bed\u0026#39Paul McCartney gets by with a little help from Auto-Tune Island of Dreams, review: Richard Branson makes an easy target in scurrilous sitcomCommons\u0026#39 Oliver Cromwell bust targeted by Labour MP is moved over \u0026#39health and safety concerns\u0026#39Gatwick and Heathrow order military-grade anti-drone defences to avoid repeat of Christmas chaosSajid Javid in talks with France to send migrants straight back across the ChannelRelative of Duchess of Cornwall wins right to take Scottish orce fight to Supreme CourtDavid Bowie app enlists Gary Oldman to bring V\u0026ampA show to your phoneBack in Time for School, review: an engaging pop-historical rompComment: Our children understand that they have to be world-beaters - but do we?MPs\u0026#39 anger as speedboat killer given legal aid to appeal conviction despite being on the runBritain can lead the world in new farming revolution, says Michael GoveWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/01/03/TELEMMGLPICT000131209177_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqLfD0EOB5CEFXzCF_NHe0S8zg6NlZ2-aGbyIcXcVFyEI.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"january time promise national self flagellation","story":"Concocted misery milestones like \u0026#39Blue Monday\u0026#39 convince us to mope about in JanuaryYes, it\u0027s cold, but self-imposed sadness gets us nowhereWe are but four days into the first month of the year, and the country is already struck down with despair.

The vocal processing is favoured by Kanye West, with  whom Sir Paul collaborated in 2015. The song was not included on Sir Paul’s current album, Egypt Station but he  played it to an interviewer last year and said: “I know people are going to  go, ‘Oh, no! Paul McCartney’s on bloody Auto-Tune! What have things come  to?’” The 76-year-old added: “Come on, man. You can’t be so straitlaced to not  expose yourself to experiences in life.” Sir Paul co-wrote and produced the track with Ryan Tedder, who has worked  with Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran.

such as sleep, exercise and face-to-face socialising.And its experts urged parents to “practise what they preach” - and spend less time of their leisure time glued to tablets and phones.The guidance comes alongside a systematic review of the scientific evidence regarding the health impact of screen time, published on Friday in BMJ Open.It found moderately strong evidence for a link between greater screen time and depressive symptoms.Researchers said it appeared that the “displacement of positive activities” - in particular, lost sleep, as a result of time spent scrolling - was the most convincing explanation for the link.And they said the impact of blue light on screens on the ability to sleep was likely to be a factor.Dr Max Davie, from the RCPCH, said stopping access to all screens for at least an hour before sleep was a  “sensible rule of thumb”.“The process of going to sleep is a physiological process involving the secretion of melatonin and screens appear to interfere with that,” he said.Researchers said the review also found links between high levels of screen time and excess weight - perhaps because children were likely to consume more snacks while staring at a screen.The college also urged parents to negotiate “age appropriate” boundaries on screen time with children, with firm consequences if such limits were breached.Dr Davie said families needed to ensure that screen time was “under control” - for adults as well as children.“Children do learn from example rather than instruction. It\u0027s difficult to impose strict limits on your children\u0027s screen use if you are constantly on screens yourself. It\u0027s much better to be authoritative about screens if you practise what you preach,” he said.“We suggest that age appropriate boundaries are established, negotiated by parent and child that everyone in the family understands. When these boundaries are not respected, actions need to be put in place with parents making consequences clear.”Four ways to keep your child safe onlineProf Russell Viner, the college’s president, said: “If you are authoritative - tough love and giving clear boundaries and warmth, that works.”The chief medical officer is currently considering setting new recommendations on screen time for children. But the college shied away from recommending a daily screen time limit for all children, saying more research was needed, particularly on the use of social media.So far, many studies on screen time have focussed on television habits, failing to keep up pace with the advent of websites and smart phones.Next week the head of the NHS is expected to unveil plans to expand children\u0027s mental health services to deal with the fallout from an explosion of social media.Simon Stevens has said the NHS has been left “picking up the pieces” of an epidemic of mental illness fuelled by digital overload.It comes after The  launched a duty of care campaign calling for more stringent regulation of sites like Facebook and Instagram, in order to protect children from harm.The expansion of mental health services for children - and the rollout of a four week target for treatment - are expected to form part of a 10-year plan for the NHS.What happens if Donald Trump is impeached – and who would be the next president?What is impeachment and how long does the process take?Councils urged to price motorists off road by NHS watchdogGirls who spend over three hours on social media twice as likely to suffer depressionPatients forced to wait twice as long when GP calls for paramedics Watch out on Sunday, it\u0026#39s the deadliest time of the yearMost Tory members would choose a no-deal Brexit over Theresa May\u0026#39s plan, poll showsChina poses greatest threat to UK as global super-power, claims new studyComment: Armed build-up means extraterrestrial warfare no longer in the realm of fantasyPaul McCartney gets by with a little help from Auto-Tune Island of Dreams, review: Richard Branson makes an easy target in scurrilous sitcomCommons\u0026#39 Oliver Cromwell bust targeted by Labour MP is moved over \u0026#39health and safety concerns\u0026#39Gatwick and Heathrow order military-grade anti-drone defences to avoid repeat of Christmas chaosSajid Javid in talks with France to send migrants straight back across the ChannelRelative of Duchess of Cornwall wins right to take Scottish orce fight to Supreme CourtDavid Bowie app enlists Gary Oldman to bring V\u0026ampA show to your phoneBack in Time for School, review: an engaging pop-historical rompComment: Our children understand that they have to be world-beaters - but do we?MPs\u0026#39 anger as speedboat killer given legal aid to appeal conviction despite being on the runBritain can lead the world in new farming revolution, says Michael GoveComment: Why are Iranians willing to risk their lives fleeing France for Britain?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2016/04/28/18/web-john-vickers-get_0.jpg","title":"bank england women financial policy committee dame colette bowe jayne anne gadia","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

One thing many cryptocurrency analysts\u0026nbspagree upon is that price volatility will steadily decrease, thanks to a combination of its finite supply and regulation designed to help the market\u0026nbspstabilise and mature.Bitcoin price predictions for 2019: From $0 to $36,000, experts weigh Whilst some critics still argue, for varying reasons, as to the longevity of\u0026nbspbitcoin, the next 10 years should at the very least provide many more talking points and events to document its life,\u0026nbspDavid Thomas, director of Mayfair-based cryptocurrency broker\u0026nbspGlobalBlock, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.If, as expected, increased regulation enters the market then bitcoin will be opened up to a broader investor base, and with increased adoption, we expect to see volatility reduce and stability increase both of which will establish bitcoin and cryptocurrencies further as an asset class in their own right.10th birthday has prompted speculation about the cryptocurrency\u0027s future (Rock Star Pastries Composite)Bitcoin\u0027s underlying blockchain technology is also expected to continue to drive an entire industry of new applications.\u0026nbspVladislav Dramaliev, head of digital marketing at aeternity, believes this is where bitcoin\u0027s real promise lies.Mr\u0026nbspDramaliev\u0026nbspdescribes bitcoin\u0027s inception as starting a curious revolution, but believes the word evolution will be more appropriate to describe the next decade of bitcoin and blockchain\u0027s growth.One of the most incredible developments is that, 10 years after that first block was mined, there is actually a whole\u0026nbspindustry\u0026nbspbased around this fantastic technology. Today we have a mind-bogglingly erse range of iniduals and companies in the sphere, covering every possible spectrum of opinion, vision for the future, and agenda, he said.The public blockchain infrastructure is getting better and better, more developers are getting interested in blockchain applications, more entrepreneurs are looking for the next killer app, and more users are playing with digital assets on a blockchain. I don’t expect this process to slow down.

Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself.

Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHFor a fleeting moment, Bros were the biggest band in Britain. Between 1987-89, they achieved eight UK top 10 singles, sold out London’s Wembley Stadium,\u0026nbspand enjoyed a huge fanbase, dubbed “Brosettes”. Their debut album\u0026nbspPush\u0026nbsptopped the charts in 19 countries, and sold more than seven million copies.\u0026nbspAfter the Screaming StopsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Apple expects revenue of $84 billion for the last quarter of 2018, $7 billion less than analysts expected.Mr Cook said: “We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States.”Apple’s announcement echoed the concerns that have pushed investors to flee the stock market over the last three months. Many global indexes posted their worst year in a decade amid concerns about the global economy and the prospect of further US interest rate increases.The S\u0026ampP 500 lost 62.14 points to 2,447.89. The Dow slid 2.8 per cent to 22,868.22. The Nasdaq, which has a high concentration of tech stocks, retreated 202.43 points, or three per cent, to 6,463.50.US government bond prices surged, sending yields to their lowest level in almost a year, and gold and high-idend stocks like utilities also rose as investors looked for safer places to put their money.A weak report on US manufacturing also weighed on the market on Thursday. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing fell to its lowest level in two years, and new orders have fallen sharply since November. Manufacturing is still growing, but at a slower pace than it has recently.Apple’s stock has slumped 39 per cent since early October. The company also recently announced that it would stop disclosing how many iPhones it sold each quarter, a move many investors suspected was an attempt to hide bad news.Apple’s share price took its biggest loss in six years to end Thursday at $142.19. Microsoft shed 3.7 percent to $97.40. Among chip makers, Intel fell 5.5 percent to $44.49. The S\u0026ampP 500 technology companies had their worst day since August 2011.European stocks were also down and the pound tumbled against the dollar and euro\u0026nbspas investors switched their money into safe havens such as the Japanese yen.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Previous studies have suggested\u0026nbspblue light emitted from the screens of laptops and smartphones can contribute to\u0026nbspblindness.\u0026nbspIn August, research by scientists from the University of Toledo, Ohio, revealed that prolonged exposure to the short-wavelength light triggers the generation of toxic molecules in the eye\u0027s light-sensitive cells.\u0026nbspIs Facebook finished? \u0027We\u0027re not far from Zuckerberg subpoena\u0027This process can lead to macular degeneration, a condition that results in blurred or no vision in the centre of the vision field.While it is thought that dark modes can help reduce eye strain, no studies have provided conclusive proof of whether the feature helps prevent this type of damage. Some experts have also questioned whether blue light can cause permanent eye damage.\u0026nbsp“Looking at artificial blue light for prolonged periods may increase eye strain and affect sleep patterns, so using ‘Dark Mode’ may help with this,\u0026nbspHenry Leonard, optometrist and head of clinical and regulatory at the Association of Optometrists, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.However, there is currently insufficient evidence to suggest that exposure to blue light from devices such as mobile phones causes permanent damage to the eye, including the retina, or increase the risk of eye conditions.\u0026nbspFacebook Messenger follows several other popular apps to introduce the feature, including YouTube, Google Maps and Firefox.WhatsApp, which is also owned by Facebook, is expected to introduce a similar feature later this year.As well as avoiding shining bright screens into people\u0027s eyes, dark modes can also improve battery life. Phones that use OLED displays do not need to light up parts of the screen that are black, potentially reducing the energy needed while the app is open.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/01/02/14/rexfeatures-1550693a.jpg","title":"fat cat friday women ftse 100 ceos earn half salaries men","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film.

But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores.

PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. Still, overall figures show the movie industry remains overwhelmingly male-dominated. Ninety-two per cent of the top 250 films had no women directors, a staggering 96 per cent had no women cinematographers, and 73 per cent had no female writers.Bros releases promo video for upcoming superhero film AquamanSeventy-four per cent of those movies didn\u0027t employ any women editors and 42 per cent had no female executive producers.Producing and executive producing roles do appear to be two of the most favourable spots for female representation: they made up 26 per cent and 21 per cent of those categories respectively.The study provides no evidence that the mainstream film industry has experienced the profound positive shift predicted by so many industry observers over the last year, Lauzen told Variety.This radical underrepresentation is unlikely to be remedied by the voluntary efforts of a few iniduals or a single studio.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Without the constraints of physical controls, these virtual tools can take on the fluidity and precision of our natural human hand motion.Project\u0026nbspSoli\u0026nbspFounder Ivan\u0026nbspPouyrev\u0026nbspexplained his motivation behind the endeavour in a video posted in 2015.Capturing the possibilities of human hands was one of my passions, he said. How could we take this incredible capability, the finesse of human actions, and apply it to the virtual world?He explained that\u0026nbspthe technology can fit onto a single chip measuring\u0026nbsp8mm\u0026nbspby\u0026nbsp10mm, allowing it to fit in a large variety of devices.What is most exciting about it is that you can shrink the entire radar and put it in a tiny chip, he said.\u0026nbspThat\u0027s what makes this approach so promising. It\u0027s extremely reliable, there\u0027s nothing to break.

It also doesn’t show\u0026nbspevidence of particular harms in younger children\u0026nbspthat would be\u0026nbspcause for recommending age limits on screen time, beyond those that exist for content of video games and social media.There is more evidence to support its recommendation that\u0026nbsp“screens are avoided for an hour before the planned bedtime”.Created with Sketch.Health news in pictures Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.140 Breeding with neanderthals helped humans fight diseasesOn migrating from Africa around 70,000 years ago, humans bumped into the neanderthals of Eurasia.

Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. The research shows even modest sleep deprivation can undermine\u0026nbspchildren’s mental and physical health, educational success and family relations,\u0026nbspand there is a plausible biological reason why screen use could be disruptive.“Going to sleep involves the production of melatonin, and screens appear to interfere with that process, the evidence is emerging but we think that’s a sensible rule of thumb,” Dr Davie added.Facebook became the latest app to introduce a “dark mode” for its instant messaging service\u0026nbspwhich reduces levels of blue light that have stoked health fears. However the RCPCH review said there wasn’t enough evidence to support blue light being particularly harmful and any bright light can disrupt sleep.The college called for more education for parents to help them set healthy patterns of screen use, and understand issues with screens such as age rating certificates for violent video games.“But we know, undoubtedly, that if a child is spending most of their day on screens, they will be not doing the physical activity, sleeping, the stuff that is beneficial.”Independent experts welcomed guidelines, particularly the close focus on evidence, but said they may not be detailed enough to help many parents.Professor Stephen Scott, director of the national academy for parenting research the King\u0027s College London said: The notion that it should stop one hour before bedtime is welcome, but more detail on exactly how to turn off Wi-Fi access and keep smart phones out of the bedroom would help parents.\u0026nbspLikewise it would have been good to have some specific number of hours recommended, e.g. one hour a day doing weekdays, perhaps 2 to 3 hours at weekends, or whatever a family feels comfortable with.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The Chief Medical Officer has commissioned a systematic evidence review on the impact of social media use on young people’s mental health. Later this year we will also publish our proposals to tackle online harm and set clear responsibilities for tech companies to keep people safe, which will consider young people and social media.”Royal College of Paediatrics and Child HealthOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

In a strange run of events, Apple froze trading on its stock and was forced to announce that its results were about to disappoint its investors.The announcement was meant primarily for Apple\u0027s shareholders, and the wide circle of analysts and financial markets that revolve around them. Tim Cook\u0027s letter announcing the change was addressed to its investors, and included information intended for them.As an indication of how rare such a statement\u0026nbspis, Apple has not done this since 2002 – long before the iPhone, and just months into the iPod era.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialFor investors and Apple itself, it\u0027s a worrying announcement about the future of the iPhone, and an admission that it was not going where it thought. That has happened for a whole host of reasons – many of them not really connected to the iPhone itself, or even Apple.But the announcement could make a difference to Apple fans and iPhone users in a wide variety of not immediately obvious ways, some of which could be positive. It is one of the most important announcements about the future of its star handset that Apple has ever made, and so will matter in some small way to everyone who uses an iPhone or will do in the future.It matters, primarily, because Apple said that people are not buying as many iPhones\u0026nbspas expected, or as it needed to sell to ensure that its investors were happy. That, in turn, means that it will most likely adjust its strategy to try and make people buy more.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightSome of the reasons people are not buying enough are both specific and too general for Apple to do anything about. But others revolve around central parts of Apple\u0027s strategy, which touch on all of its customers.In his letter announcing the weaker than expected results, Mr\u0026nbspCook cited a number of reasons to the drop. He pointed above all to weakness in China\u0027s economy – in part caused by an ongoing trade war between it and the US – but he also said that there were problems elsewhere, too.Chief among the other reasons for Apple\u0027s weaker than expected performance is likely to be the higher prices that it has started to charge for its iPhones, as well as other products.Gradually, Apple has pushed up the prices for both the cheapest versions of its new phones and the ones at the very top of the line. Over the last couple of years, Apple has changed its pricing strategy so that the cheapest model of the phone – the XR, which starts at $749 – would have been at the top end in the years that went before.As well as leading people to think twice about whether they can afford or want to pay that much for a new iPhone, the higher prices came at the same time Apple announced a wide-ranging and heavily discounted program to allow people to replace their phone\u0027s batteries. That came in response to a controversy that raged at Christmas last year, amid\u0026nbspsuggestions that Apple was intentionally slowing down old phones.Apple suggested that a higher-than-expected number of people taking up that deal – presumably in part because the battery replacements were so cheap, and a whole new phone was so expensive – had also helped dampen demand. At the same time, Apple made keeping an old phone more appealing in other ways, such as the new iOS 12 update that sped older handsets\u0026nbspup dramatically.That as well as other factors mean that people are holding onto their old iPhones for a longer period of time. And that means they\u0027re not buying new ones, hurting Apple.The company\u0027s response is still unknown and could come in a variety of forms. Apple might choose to cut the price of its most expensive models in future, for instance, meaning that the next phone will cost less it could also try and ramp up improvements in the coming years to ensure that the new handsets remain more compelling.Whatever happens, Apple appears to have been forced to realise that it has pushed the top end of the iPhone\u0027s pricing too far. Customers have given their verdict by just not buying the phones – and it will now be Apple\u0027s turn to try and convince them otherwise.It might also be that Apple turns towards its other products, at the same time, in an attempt to ersify away from the handset that represents a vast part of its profits. It has already been looking to focus on services such as Apple Music to ensure that customers still give it money even after they\u0027ve bought their products, and has been branching out further into accessories with the release of the AirPods, HomePod and more.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/10/29/17/iphone.jpg","title":"iphone apple battery replacement cheap last date price swap store","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

For the moment, a new battery costs only £25 – but once the new year arrives, that will rocket up to as much as £65.Old batteries can cause significant problems for their owners as iPhones age. With use, the power begins to drop – something that can lead to phones lasting for much less time, and to Apple having to slow down phones to ensure that they don\u0027t crash because they\u0027re not getting enough power.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIt was the revelation that Apple was doing that – throttling performance on older phones, in line with more spectacular rumours that swirled before it was admitted – that led to the cheap repairs in the first place.When that story came out over the Christmas period in 2017, Apple apologised and said that as part of a range of ways of making it up to customers it would knock down the price of replacements, allowing people to restore their phone\u0027s performance if their battery had been degraded.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

Once the programme is over, the same service will cost £45 for most phones, and a full £65 for the iPhone X.Apple gives governments increased access to phone dataThe iPhone X recently became eligible for the throttling, which Apple still applies to more strained batteries to ensure they perform properly. One of the other forms of restitution offered to users was the option to turn that off, which can be found in Settings.Phones that are covered by its warranty period or extended AppleCare coverage will remain free, as they always have been.As the end of the year approaches, Apple Stores appear to be especially busy with users rushing to take advantage of the offer. Genius Bar appointments can be few and far between, though some customers have had success turning up at stores.The replacements require that a battery is sufficiently degraded, which will be checked by Geniuses at the store but can be seen by heading to the Battery options in the Settings app. But some customers appear to have successfully had batteries that are not under the critical 80 per cent mark swapped out all the same.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/27/12/samsung-galaxy-s10-leak-camera.jpg  width= 1254  height= 836  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/27/12/samsung-galaxy-s10-leak-camera.jpg","title":"samsung galaxy s10 release date price camera specs camera screen leaks","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Since it is so massive, the satellite galaxy is quickly losing energy – meaning that it is doomed to fall into our galaxy and cause huge disruption, relatively quickly.“While two billion years is an extremely long time compared to a human lifetime, it is a very short time on cosmic timescales, said lead author Dr Marius Cautun, a postdoctoral fellow in Durham University’s Institute for Computational Cosmology.“The destruction of the Large Magellanic Cloud, as it is devoured by the Milky Way, will wreak havoc with our galaxy, waking up the black hole that lives at its centre and turning our galaxy into an ‘active galactic nucleus’ or quasar.“This phenomenon will generate powerful jets of high energy radiation emanating from just outside the black hole. While this will not affect our Solar System, there is a small chance that we might not escape unscathed from the collision between the two galaxies which could knock us out of the Milky Way and into interstellar space.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Apple expects revenue of $84 billion for the last quarter of 2018, $7 billion less than analysts expected.Mr Cook said: “We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States.”Apple’s announcement echoed the concerns that have pushed investors to flee the stock market over the last three months. Many global indexes posted their worst year in a decade amid concerns about the global economy and the prospect of further US interest rate increases.The S\u0026ampP 500 lost 62.14 points to 2,447.89. The Dow slid 2.8 per cent to 22,868.22. The Nasdaq, which has a high concentration of tech stocks, retreated 202.43 points, or three per cent, to 6,463.50.US government bond prices surged, sending yields to their lowest level in almost a year, and gold and high-idend stocks like utilities also rose as investors looked for safer places to put their money.A weak report on US manufacturing also weighed on the market on Thursday. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing fell to its lowest level in two years, and new orders have fallen sharply since November. Manufacturing is still growing, but at a slower pace than it has recently.Apple’s stock has slumped 39 per cent since early October. The company also recently announced that it would stop disclosing how many iPhones it sold each quarter, a move many investors suspected was an attempt to hide bad news.Apple’s share price took its biggest loss in six years to end Thursday at $142.19. Microsoft shed 3.7 percent to $97.40. Among chip makers, Intel fell 5.5 percent to $44.49. The S\u0026ampP 500 technology companies had their worst day since August 2011.European stocks were also down and the pound tumbled against the dollar and euro\u0026nbspas investors switched their money into safe havens such as the Japanese yen.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17.

On first glance, the clan at its centre are just like any other, but their impulsive decision to take in a missing girl begins a series of rug-pulls you wouldn’t expect from a film such as this. A complex heartbreaker, albeit one that starts out looking like the more modest family dramas Kore-eda is known for.  “We knew there was a bad version of this movie that could exist,” said Game Night’s co-director John Francis Daley (the kid from Freaks and Geeks). This certainly isn’t it. Starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams as a competitive married couple who mistake an actual kidnapping for a particularly immersive role play game, Game Night is snappy, witty and fully committed to its brilliant, tonally unsettling conceit.  315 13. Isle of DogsAny Wes Anderson film is likely to be offbeat, fastidiously stylish and shot through with the auteur\u0027s understated drollery. Isle of Dogs is no different. A stop-motion story of abandoned canines taking on a corrupt human government, it\u0027s set in a futuristic Japan and deals with some pretty heavy themes (fascism, ethnic cleansing). Funny and full of heart.Peter Jackson’s First World War documentary is a remarkable step-forward for historical filmmaking. The Lord of the Rings director breathes new life into black and white archive footage from the Imperial War Museum, digitally restoring and smoothing the grainy source material before adding colour and sound. The result is a stunning cinematic experience that vividly brings the past into the present. By using the voices of veteran British soldiers interviewed about their experiences in the trenches, Jackson also includes a fascinating narrative that’s both gripping and informative. A wonderfully apt way to mark the centenary of the Great War. Nobody knew if Paul Schrader still had it in him to make a film as angry or as barbed as First Reformed. There is the same raw power here as found in his earlier features about tormented loners. Cinephiles will delight in the (sometimes a little self-conscious) references to Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky, but you can’t help but relish the intensity and intelligence in Ethan Hawke’s performance as the tormented, guilt-ridden priest.There were two Marvel films released this year, one of which – Avengers Infinity War – was an over-crowded, if ambitious, sequel. The other was a landmark film – not just for Marvel, but for cinema. Black Panther was fit to bursting with selling points, all combining to deliver the studio’s best film: Michael B Jordan’s standout villain, scene-stealing performances from Danai Guria and Letitia Wright, plus the direction of Creed’s Ryan Coogler who proved an inspired appointment. Wakanda forever, indeed.Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War, shot in the sleekest black and white, is an effortlessly stylish and romantic drama set in a period of political convulsion. It offers everything from Polish folk music to the sultriest Birth of the Cool-style jazz. Pawlikowski includes moments of reckless hedonism alongside scenes of exile and imprisonment. Best of all, the film has a truly wonderful performance from Joanna Kulig as Zula, the free-spirited young folk singer turned femme fatale.There are no two ways about it: Bradley Cooper\u0027s rock star Jackson Mane inviting Ally – a small-town waitress played by Lady Gaga – onto stage to sing her song in front of thousands of his fans is movie magic. Regardless of your stance on the film\u0027s back half and pretty maudlin ending, A Star is Born is an old-fashioned success story with an intensity that brings up the hairs on the back of your neck.Director Chloé Zhao took a gamble casting a real-life family in this modern-day western about a cowboy named Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau). It pays off – this an authentic portrait of contemporary rodeo life in South Dakota. From her amateur cast she somehow coaxes performances more memorable than most pros manage in their entire careers. As moving as it is bold, The Rider also offers an all-too-rare female perspective on masculinity. Eight years after Winter’s Bone made a star of Jennifer Lawrence, Leave No Trace – director Debra Granik’s first feature film since then – should rightly make a star of Thomasin McKenzie too. Based on the book My Abandonment by Peter Rook, Leave No Trace is virtually a two-hander between McKenzie and Ben Foster. They play a PTSD-suffering war veteran and his daughter, who live in the forests of Oregon, fending for themselves. Even when the two are arrested and placed in government housing, the film refuses to be anything other than understated and is all the more beguiling for it.1115 5. The Shape of WaterLoneliness can sometimes feel like your soul has been chained to the bottom of the ocean, at other times it can feel like you’re speaking a language no one else understands. Guillermo del Toro beautifully illustrates both these nuances in his Oscar-winning fantasy romance, in which a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) unexpectedly falls for a strange aquatic creature (Doug Jones), the only one who sees her as she truly wants to be seen. Theirs is a love so mystical, so overwhelming, that it can only be communicated through the language of dreams. Lady Bird will always be close to our hearts. There are times when it feels less like a film, more like a hand tracing delicately through memories, of what it felt like to grow up, to say goodbye, and to find one\u0027s own place in the universe. Greta Gerwig’s story of a teenager, played by Saoirse Ronan, desperate to escape her hometown and seek the intellectual haven of the East Coast colleges (“where the culture is”, she argues) may be specific in its layout, but it is universal in its emotions. Whenever Lynne Ramsey attaches her name to a film, you know to expect something special. You Were Never Really Here marks a career-high for the British auteur, who manages to condense the violent story of a former military man searching for a stolen girl into a viciously edited 90-minute thriller. Joaquin Phoenix makes for the perfect enigmatic leading man, while Jonny Greenwood’s mechanical, piercing score adds to the decidedly eerie atmosphere.Should Phantom Thread really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film, then the actor can retire knowing that Reynolds Woodcock ranks among his greatest roles. Day-Lewis plays the egomaniacal fashion designer with a childish whimsy, but there\u0027s also a spectral quality to him that looms in every scene. Lesley Manville’s deliciously funny Cyril and Vicky Krieps’s superbly sharp Alma offer two cunning counters to Reynolds’s growing appetite for self-destruction, making for some wonderfully heated confrontations. Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him. It\u0027s a neorealist masterpiece, shot in 65mm black and white, and built from detailed vignettes of domestic life in early 1970s Mexico City, a time there of great social unrest. Savour every scene: the camera takes it all in, as we follow a young Mixtec woman named Cleo (wonderful newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) who looks after a well-to-do family she comes to think of as her own. It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters could be the year’s most disarming film.

Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him. It\u0027s a neorealist masterpiece, shot in 65mm black and white, and built from detailed vignettes of domestic life in early 1970s Mexico City, a time there of great social unrest. Savour every scene: the camera takes it all in, as we follow a young Mixtec woman named Cleo (wonderful newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) who looks after a well-to-do family she comes to think of as her own. It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.Avengers: Infinity War was the fourth best selling home entertainment release of the year across digital retail, blu-ray and DVD, followed by Paddington 2.Liz Bales, chief executive of BASE said: “The third consecutive year of growth in the video category underlines the fact that audiences remain engaged with a broad variety of home entertainment content and format options.“This serves as a testament to the innovation and energy that continue to drive the home entertainment category even as the high street retail environment presents clear challenges in some areas.“Today’s customers enjoy a multitude of options when it comes to keeping themselves entertained and clearly continue to find a huge amount of relevance in the video category which, more flexibly than ever before, caters to every need whether that is watching on the go, building a digital library or securing the absolute best viewing experience premium formats now guarantee.“We face into the New Year with a clear desire to build on successes but also to ensure that the degree of choice available remains one of the category’s great strengths.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Clunge. Muffwagon. Goodness, it’s been a long time since we’ve heard those creative expressions of male sexual frustration, and it\u0027s\u0026nbspnice to hear them again, like old friends, or “Fwends” in this case. The Inbetweeners are back. Sort of.Even by the usually self-congratulatory standards of tellyland, the total of four hours and 10 minutes of airtime devoted by Channel 4 to their 2008 hit The Inbetweeners\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspa tad self-indulgent, though it is one of the channel’s recent glories.\u0026nbspHosted, inevitably, by the roughly contemporaneous Jimmy Carr, the first two hours of this teenage marathon, The Inbetweeners: Fwends Reunited, is given over to a sort of mix of This is Your Life, An Audience With..., and Radio 4’s The Reunion. That is followed by four full episodes of the series, mostly for the devotees, I imagine, as well as any stray viewers unfamiliar with this comedic landmark to judge this odyssey of pubic discovery, adolescence and embarrassment at first hand.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn all, The Inbetweeners ran to three series and two films, predominantly onanistic in tone, and most of the cast and creators turn\u0026nbspup for this celebration of its 10th anniversary. The Fwends Reunited show is dominated, naturally, by the four sixth form virginal idiots a good shag would have probably sorted out, but who, fortunately for us, never got lucky. Simon Bird (as Will McKenzie), Joe Thomas (Simon Cooper), James Buckley (Jay Cartwright) and Blake Harrison (Neil Sutherland) confirm the impression that they were basically playing themselves in The Inbetweeners and haven’t changed much since the last piece was smut was propelled like a flying turd into the public’s consciousness in 2014. I just hope their real-time personas have managed to “plunge some clunge” as they approach early middle age. Not sure, though.Given the vast prairie of time to fill, the producers plunder every known format to maintain some kind of momentum, and mostly to good effect, \u0026nbspthanks to the timeless quality of the original gags. So there is a series of “Awards” for stuff like “best bodily malfunction”, and I for one will never tire of seeing Simon projectile vomiting semi-digested creme de menthe on his girlfriend’s six-year-old brother nor of Simon’s left testicle hanging forlornly from his posing pouch in the school fashion show nor of watching Will tearfully confessing to his teacher that “I thought it was a fart”, as he had to be escorted from the A level exam room. You can almost smell the, er, shame.\u0026nbspThe 10 best TV shows of 2018The Inbetweeners\u0027 James Buckley \u0027could have died\u0027 filming boat scene There is a mini-quiz segment too, featuring Inbetweeners “super fans” whose programme knowledge exceeded that of the cast themselves, with a scholarly textual grasp of lines such as: “What is Swansea. Is it an animal?” “What\u0027s this pesto stuff? Is it for humans?” and “Just cos you’ve had your first puff on your first joint it doesn’t make you Kurt Cobain.”One super fan even had a tattoo of a grinning Jay with the inscription “CLUNGE” garnishing her upper thigh – ironically about as close as Jay ever got to a lady’s bodily treasure.The quiz “prize”, won by a Will lookalike in specs and a blazer, is a bright yellow M-reg Fiat Cinquecento Hawaii Edition, complete with “tape deck” and red passenger door.This runabout is also the co-star of the Fwends show and features in the freshly filmed sequences, such as their nostalgic trip back to Rudge Park Comprehensive\u0026nbsp(, as Carr puts it “in a car none of them owned to a school none of them went to”. Will relives the moment when he shat himself, which is, well, moving.Created with Sketch.Best TV of 2018 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair. Instead it was a gripping start to Sky Atlantic\u0027s impressive run, with James taking the lead as Nelly, the womanising bum who gains a new lease of investigative energy when his estranged daughter Jody vanishes. A smart script kept us guessing right up to an ending that denied us the closure we had expected. A second series has been commissioned.  210 9) Cunk on BritainHow much you enjoyed Philomena Cunk\u0027s history of Britain depended on how funny you find Diane Morgan\u0027s resting confused face. I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair.

I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.The talking (dick) heads are good too, especially when creators Damon Beesley and Iain Morris explain the genesis of some of the set pieces, often based on their own life experiences. Beesley, for example, confesses how he had ranted some foul-mouthed sarcastic abuse at some hapless kids for pushing in at an amusement park before bullying his way onto the ride. Smug, he turned to them and only then discovered that the selfish bastards were at the front of the rollercoaster because they had Down syndrome.\u0026nbspGreg Davies’s presence as the bad-tempered teacher Mr Gilbert is also enjoyable. No wonder that Davies went into comedy having himself been a bad-tempered teacher (“a living hell” in his seemingly sincere description). Waen Shepherd (Mr “Paedo” Kennedy) is extremely game to join in the fun –\u0026nbspperhaps surprising given the times we live in. Indeed, I wonder, only a few years on, if phrases such as “spaz” and “rapey” could be scripted now.You could call it a retrospective then, if you were pretentious enough, or “going in balls deep” if you’re Jimmy Carr. Although it lacks a certain pointfulness - the cast are even more absurdly old to play adolescents again and there will \u0026nbspbe no more episodes or movies \u0026nbsp- and all concerned refuse to take itself too seriously, which is just as well. Like a more successful sort of school reunion.\u0026nbspThere’s nothing more tedious than people earnestly trying to deconstruct comedy: much better instead just to get on with the clips and the poo jokes. And so they do, and so does Will get a high speed turd in the face from a water chute, and suddenly we are all back in the sixth form disco again.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

President Minette Batters said that with less than 90 days to go until exit day, there was still “enormous uncertainty” about the future of Britain’s food production.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”Mr Corbyn also urged Labour supporters demanding he stop Brexit to “recognise a number of things”, saying: “About 60 per cent of Labour voters voted remain, about 40 per cent voted leave. We have to recognise why people voted in those directions.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal Brexit“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”However, some estimates have put Labour voters’ backing remain at more than 60 per cent – while one recent poll found their support for a further referendum to be 80 per cent.The interview triggered a backlash from some Labour MPs, Chris Leslie, the Nottingham East MP, tweeting: “If Jeremy Corbyn facilitates Brexit he’ll share responsibility for the job losses, trade barriers and decade of austerity to come.Angela Smith, the Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, said: “We need to get the message over to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour members and supporters want a People’s Vote.”Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “There you have it, Jeremy Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off. He is ignoring the concerns of his own supporters and the economic damage experts warn Brexit will do to the UK economy.”In reality, the chances of a snap election in the new year are slim, with Theresa May having ruled it out – and many Tories opposed to her deal happy to run down the clock to a no-deal Brexit.Instead, Mr Corbyn is under pressure to swing behind a fresh referendum if – as seems certain – the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote”, in the second week of January and his vote of no confidence in her government fails.Some Labour insiders believe Labour backing for a referendum is all-but certain in those circumstances, given the party\u0027s inability to set out what the other “options on the table” it could pursue might be.Expats set to lose healthcare under no-deal Brexit, NHS toldThink homelessness is bad now?

He confirmed he will remain in post and thinks it is important to continue working with Cabinet colleagues to ensure the best Brexit outcome for the countryTheresa May chuckles at a press conference in Downing Street after a tough day in which multiple cabinet members have resigned and a number of MPs have tabled votes of no confidence in her leadership“If some of those MPs can be persuaded to back the prime minister’s deal, it won’t be because they’ve come under pressure to do so from their local party members over the Christmas break,” said Prof Bale.\u0026nbspThe study found that 59 per cent of Tory members opposed Ms May’s deal, compared to 38 per cent who supported it and 3 per cent who did not have an opinion.More than half, 53 per cent, also said that the deal “does not respect the result of the referendum”, comparing to 42 per cent who said that it does.People were then asked how they would vote in a referendum where there were three options – to remain, leave with the deal or leave without one – and in which they are able to put down a first and second preference.Some 57 per cent opted to leave with no deal as their first choice, with only 23 per cent putting Ms May’s deal and 15 per cent backing the option to remain in the EU.Forty per cent\u0026nbspthen put the prime minister’s proposals as their second choice, with 19 per cent putting no deal and 6\u0026nbspper cent opting to stay as a member of the bloc.The survey showed large majorities of members think both that a no-deal Brexit will have a positive impact on the economy in the medium to long term and that warnings of disruption have been exaggerated.A slim majority, 51 per cent, said they thought Ms May was doing “well”, but almost as many, 48 per cent said she was doing “badly” to some degree.But despite wavering support for Ms May and her deal, an overwhelming majority of members – 83 per cent – opposed the idea of having an election, while 82 per cent would not back a further referendum.Yesterday, the prime minister’s Northern Irish partners in government raised the stakes further in the Brexit talks, saying there is “no need” for key parts of the deal she agreed with the EU.Nigel Dodds, DUP deputy leader,\u0026nbspargued that the withdrawal agreement she is seeking “flies in the face” of the government’s own commitments relating to the border between the north and the republic.His comments came after a meeting in Downing Street, and are a blow to the prime minister as she desperately tries to convince the Northern Irish party and her own MPs to back her proposals ahead of a vote in the coming weeks.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

This is being immediately rectified.”The government is spending a total of\u0026nbsp£108m on chartering ferries to transport goods and reduce congestion at Dover in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The deal will see two other companies, Danish firm DFDS and French company Brittany Ferries appointed to provide freight services if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal.Seaborne Freight has been instructed to operate\u0026nbspferries from\u0026nbspRamsgate\u0026nbspin Kent to Ostend in Belgium, beginning with two ships in late March and increasing to four by the end of the summer.The company said it had been working since\u0026nbsp2017 on reopening a ferry route from Ramsgate, including “locating suitable vessels, making arrangements with the ports of Ostend and Ramsgate, building the infrastructure – such as bunkering – as well as crewing the ferries once they start operating”.It added: “It was intended to start the service in mid-February but this has now been delayed until late March for operational reasons.“This coincides with the Department for Transport’s\u0026nbspfreight capacity purchase agreement with Seaborne which is part of their preparations to increase ferry capacity in the unlikely event of a no-deal Brexit.”But a Conservative councillor for Ramsgate\u0026nbspquestioned the decision to award the contract to the firm.Paul Messenger told the BBC:\u0026nbsp“It has no ships and no trading history so how can due diligence be done?“Why choose a company that never moved a single truck in their entire history and give them £14m?

In 2014, astronomers found Thule using the Hubble Space Telescope and selected it for New Horizon’s extended mission in 2015. “Anything’s possible out there in this very unknown region,” said John Spencer, deputy project scientist for New Horizons. Launched in January 2006, New Horizons embarked on a 4 billion mile journey towards the solar system’s frigid edge to study the dwarf planet Pluto and its five moons. The spacecraft, which is the size of a baby grand piano, flew past Pluto in 2015, providing the first close-up views of the planet. During the flyby, the probe found Pluto to be slightly larger than previously thought. In March, it revealed that methane-rich dunes were on the icy dwarf planet’s surface.After trekking 1 billion miles beyond Pluto into the Kuiper belt, New Horizons will now seek clues about the formation of the solar system and its planets.There is a great deal scientists can learn from Ultima and the hundreds of thousands of similar bodies scientists deem to be in the solar system. Hal Weaver, project scientist on the mission, told the BBC the rock is “probably the most primitive object ever encountered by a spacecraft, the best possible relic of the early solar system”. The object is officially known as 2014 MU69, but was nicknamed Ultima Thule, a Latin phrase which means “beyond the borders of the known world”.Additional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Previous spacecraft have seen the far side, but none have landed on it.The landing “lifted the mysterious veil” of the far side of the moon and “opened a new chapter in human lunar exploration”, the agency said in a statement on its website, which included a wide-angle colour picture of a crater from the moon’s surface.The probe, which has a lander and a rover, touched down at a targeted area near the moon’s south pole in the Von Karman Crater after entering the moon’s orbit in mid-December.The tasks of the Chang’e-4 include astronomical observation, surveying the moon’s terrain, landform and mineral makeup, and measuring the neutron radiation and neutral atoms to study the environment of its far side.In a tweet, Nasa’s administrator, Jim Bridenstine, praised China for its “impressive\u0026nbspaccomplishment”.\u0026nbsp“Congratulations to China’s Chang’e-4 team for what appears to be a successful landing on the far side of the Moon. This is a first for humanity and an impressive accomplishment!”The landing is a milestone for China in its race to catch up with Russia and the US and become a major space power by 2030. Beijing plans to launch construction of its own manned space station next year.While China has insisted its ambitions are purely peaceful, the US\u0026nbspDefence Department has accused it of pursuing activities aiming to prevent other nations from using space-based assets during a crisis.Besides its civilian ambitions, China has tested anti-satellite missiles, and the US\u0026nbspCongress has banned Nasa\u0026nbspfrom two-way cooperation with its Chinese counterpart over security concerns.As competition accelerates in space,\u0026nbspDonald Trump seeks to create a new “Space Force” by 2020, as the sixth branch of the military.China lands spacecraft on far side of moon in world firstBut the private space race is also heating up, as numerous companies aim to commercialise space travel, such as California-based SpaceX, which has upended the industry with its low-cost reusable Falcon 9 rockets.The US\u0026nbspis the only country to have landed humans on the moon, and Mr Trump said in 2017 he wanted to return astronauts to the lunar surface to build a foundation for an eventual Mars mission.Nasa\u0026nbspadministrators have said people could be put on Mars by as soon as the mid-2030s, with the agency having landed eight spacecraft there, the most recent in November.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The first ever image of the far side of the moon taken by China\u0027s Chang\u0027e-4 probe after its landingTwo men walk past a damaged cargo train after an accident in Nyborg, Denmark.

Heavy rainfall is anticipated to arrive in a few hours.Several popular tourist sites are expected to affected: Koh Samui, Koh Phangan, Koh Tao, Phuket, and Koh Phi Phi to name a few.We are still compiling the number of evacuees. I can say several thousand people for over 16 provinces, Putthipong Punnakanta, a spokesman for the Thai government, told CNN.It is high season, there are many foreign tourists at popular destinations. We have informed them in advance since two days ago. I would say most of them have left islands and come to the mainland.Tropical storm Pabuk was blowing winds up to 104km per hour, or 65 miles per hour, but it is unlikely that it\u0027ll acerbate into a full-blow typhoon, according to forecasters.\u0026nbsp“But we expect waves as high as five or seven metres near the eye of the storm. Normally in the Gulf of Thailand there are only two metre high waves,” Phuwieng Prakammaintara, director general at the Thai Meteorological Department, told reporters.\u0026nbsp“It’s difficult to predict the severity of the storm so people should comply with authorities’ recommendations.”Evacuations are under way as Thailand prepares for Storm Pabuk to pound its southern beach resorts. Ferry services have been suspended in the region and\u0026nbspevacuation centres have been set up in the areas expected to bear the brunt of the weather event.Please allow a moment for the liveblog to loadOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. Getting Brits paid faster would also help stop thousands from falling into debt when they move over.The Sun has told how countless Brits have been pushed into debt waiting for the first payment to come through.Ministers are already paying  weeks of extra benefits to those claiming housing costs when they transfer, and those on ESA and JSA will get an extra payment by  too, it was confirmed in the Budget.If the payments were also extended to cover those on working tax credits at the moment, it could help  million people who claimed them in  .The DWP could also speed up the time to process payments by using the Faster Payments process for all claims - they currently use them only when payment is needed the same day.The BACS payment they currently use can take up to three days just to clear. The Resolution Foundation is also calling for single parents to get their own work allowance of at least  hours on the minimum wage.Experts calculate that raising the work allowance - the amount people on Universal Credit can earn without losing any benefits -  would help , employees.That means a single mum who was renting could get an extra £, a year - more than £ a month.They also argue that introducing a second earner work allowance of  hours on minimum wage would boost the income of a family with a child by £, a year too.It would cost £.billion to put in place, RF calculated.Laura Gardiner said:“The Chancellor’s recent decision to reinvest in Universal Credit by increasing Work Allowances will deliver a £ living standards boost to millions of families, and shows where further support should be prioritised. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000459022098.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"2019 is full of hope","story":"We have much to look forward to in the months ahead.You would scarcely believe it when listening to the Remain doom-mongers but away from the Westminster bubble, Britain is thriving.Today, Brits have never had more cash in their pockets.

And despite reports of a “Brexodus”, for every two EU citizens who leave our shores, three arrive.Brexit, of course, was never about pulling up the drawbridge.

Clearly there is much work to be done before then. It is vital Theresa May fights EU chiefs to ensure we have the right to trade freely across the globe without the “backstop” threat.Her Government must continue planning for a No Deal Brexit, so thatwe are forced into a clean break, Britain will continue to be Great.We want more energy and bold thinking from the Government. The country is crying out for some real leadership.The housing market remains broken, our NHS is strained, and the high street is in dire straits.Meanwhile, the migrant crisis has shown how quickly a problem can escalateit is not tackled head-on.Mrs May bought herself temporary respite by winning her no-confidence vote. But Sun readers need more reasons why she should be in No, other than the fact she isn’t Jeremy Corbyn.Elsewhere, Gareth Southgate’s Three Lions will go for Nations League glory and our brilliant women’s team have a World Cup to win at France .

I think he’s losing the plot”.As the frontrunner now to succeed Theresa May in No, Mr Javid has suffered a wave of bitter attacks from Tory MPs over his handling of the Channel migration furore.The backlash forced him tohome early from a luxury family holiday on Monday to take personal charge of the political crisis.But close friends of high-flying Mr Javid last night accused jealous rivals of seizing on the crisis to try to damage any future leadership bid by him.One senior MP and close ally said last night: “There is a ludicrous attempt to discredit Sajid, and it’s coming from Hunt, Boris and Raab’s people.“They are desperate to undermine someone who speaks sense and can reach parts of the country that nobody  can. It’spathetic.”The Home Secretary’s aides also hold a senior No figure responsible for leaking the location of his exclusive South African safari lodge.Mr Javid’s advisers claim it was done in revenge to embarrass him after he repeatedly clashed with the PM.A spokeswoman for the Home Secretary last night said it is “completely untrue” that he calls himself ‘The Sajid’ in Whitehall meetings. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The EU will be guided through its many problems by a basket-case country with a pygmy economy, most of whose citizens are desperate to get the hell out and reach the UK.Every time you might doubt we did the right thing in voting to leave, the EU comes up with another brilliant reason not to stay in.Romania, with its beleaguered government and wealth per person lower than Trinidad  Tobago and Kazakhstan. That’s who will be running the show.Right now, though, we have to get our act together. In the middle of this month there will be a debate in Parliament about Theresa May’s “new” deal for us to leave the EU.Government ministers have been whispering that May has won some concessions from the EU negotiating team. I hope so. But I kind of have my doubts.As Lord Sugar might put it, she couldn’t sell prosecco to a hen party. But it’s time to get behind her. Time, too, for arch-Brexiteers to cease being so self-indulgent and vote through a deal that is the least-worst option.Sure, I’m no fan of Theresa’s Pedigree Chum plan ­— a dog’s dinnerever there was one. Truth be told, I’d rather we crashed out with no deal at all.But that would be more dangerous — for the British economy and even for Brexit.And waiting in the wingsthe Prime Minister fails to get her plan through is Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party.Frankly, I would rather stay in the EU than have Jezza as Prime Minister. As Tom Harris, a Labour Brexiteer, put it, May’s deal gives us Leavers slightly more than half of what we voted for. And given the result of the referendum two years ago, that seems about right to me. None of us get exactly what we want.But we do leave the EU and we retain control of our borders. And soon we’ll be free to strike our own, independent, trade deals. Reach out to the rest of the world. That seems to me a decent compromise.The problem lies in convincing the arch-Brexiteer Conservative MPs that now is the time to give up the fight. I understand their many reservations. But the reality is the deal May puts before the House of Commons is about the only solution that stands a chance of winning a majority.And we are in this position largely because the Tory Brexiteers never managed to sort themselves out. At every stage, they were ided among themselves and too often concerned about their political careers.Sothis isn’t the deal we all wanted, they have themselves to blame.Our negotiations with the EU should have been done with confidence and self-discipline.Instead, we were always on the back foot because of Conservative in-fighting.Now it’s time to get serious, at long last. Becausewe don’t push this deal through, we may not get Brexit at all.MY wish for the New Year is that someone might tell me what Kendall Jenner, Rita Ora and Ferne McCann actually do for a living. Other than this kinda thing.That’s wish No. Wish No is that Gary Lineker takes a self-awareness course and discovers he’s a bumptious t***er who knows next to nowt.Most of my social-media friends went to bed at pm to avoid seeing London Mayor Sadiq Khan’s ludicrous fireworks display.And all the downstairs lights were off in the houses in my street.Are people getting bored with New Year’s Eve, do you reckon Our Foreign Secretary has just landed in Singapore to drum up more trade for Britain post Brexit.This tiny country – just a city state – is a major economic force and an important ally.It’s also a good lesson for those whining lefties who blame colonialism for the desperate plight of Africa.Singapore was founded as a British trading post exactly  years ago. It was under British control until .It has a booming economy, one of the world’s highest le expectancies and a top standard of living.So it’s not done too badly, has it The truth is colonialism is NOTHING to do with the failure of African countries. It’s about good government.Theres going to be a gay bar in EastEnders.This is an innovation dreamed up by the new script editor, Kate Oates.It’s intended to make the programme more closely represent the area in which it’s set.Ha! Here’s a tip, Ms Oates. If you want EastEnders to truly reflect the borough in which it’s set – Tower Hamlets – you need a few more sweeping changes.Fewer than a third of Tower Hamlets’ residents are white British, so that’s most of the cast gone.Almost  per cent of the people there are Bangladeshi, so the programme should be broadcast in Bengali, not English.Come on, Kate. You want EastEnders to be more real Then make it REALLY real.Lets be honest. It’s not just whichever oaf parked Paul Pogba’s car in that disabled bay who is doing it.When I go to my local supermarket, all the disabled bays are full, every time.No stickers in the car windows.And the people inside the store don’t seem to be limping very much. Sometimes I fantasise about waiting by their cars, with a hammer, for them to emerge with their shopping.“Disabled, huh  Well, you are now.”But one of the problems, I think, is that we have too many disabled bays.And so people don’t take them seriously.Quite clearly, the French are doing nothing whatsoever to deter them.It wouldn’t surprise methey were actually herding them on to the dinghies.“Go on, monsieur, you can see the clfs over there. It’s not far. Bon voyage, mon ami.”It’s another two fingers from the hopeless French because we’re leaving the European Union.What we should be doing is towing the migrants all the way back to Calais.I know living in France is probably a “cruel and unusual punishment” under United Nations laws. But it’s time the French took their responsibilities a bit more seriously.Another year dawns with something  to be terried about.Evil Chinese mussels have invaded British waters, apparently. They smother our decent, God-fearing British scallops and oysters.By the time you read this, they will probably have made their way up the Thames.It’s time we took a stand against these vile, bivalved b******s.Leave our oysters alone, you Commies!

The forthcoming Channel  drama, to be broadcast on Monday, sees the Sherlock star play Cummings, the maverick strategist behind the Vote Leave campaign. But speaking after an preview screening Brexit: The Uncivil War, writer James Graham admitted Mr Cummings was the last figure to come on board. “Cummings didn’t really say yes until the very end, “ he said. Asked how he persuaded him to get on board, he replied: “Weirdly, it was the day that Benedict Cumberbatch got cast, and suddenly…he got back to me.” He quickly added: “I’m not sure that’s fair, because by the time my invite to him got to him, by ious back channels, that was the day he was cast, and he was happy to meet. “I just had to persuade him it wasn’t a stitch up job.”  Mr Graham responded to claims Mr Cumberbatch had demanded script re-writes to make Mr Cummings a less sympathetic character. The star has made no secret of his pro-EU leanings, and signed a letter organised by the Stronger In campaign which declared: Britain is not just stronger in Europe, it is more imaginative and more creative, and our global creative success would be severely weakened by walking away.” According to the Times, Mr Cumberbatch was “initially unhappy” with the script, because it showed Cummings in a “positive light, and he wanted to play him as a much darker figure.”  Mr Graham said: “I saw that story as well and I was completely baffled that an actor would want their character to be less sympathetic. “Anyone who knows anything about acting knows that you can’t inhabit a role unless you can empathise with them, and that was Benedict’s chief obsession. “That’s why Dominic was very gracious with inviting Benedict into his home. I think they had falafel and stayed up until  in the morning. “Because Benedict wanted to understand someone who he politically disagrees with, he’s very open about that, but wants to empathise with. “I don’t know how  you can play a role unless you can get under someone’s skin and possibly quite like them on a personal level, evenyou disagree with their politics.” "},{"url":null,"title":"esa benefits technical glitch means","story":"NewsESA benefits technical glitch means some people are getting their money earlyEmployment and Support Allowanceand Jobseekers Allowance payments have been unexpectedly split for an unknown number of claimantsShare and Jobseekers Allowance payments have been unexpectedly split for an unknown number of claimants\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\" and Jobseekers Allowance payments have been unexpectedly split for an unknown number of claimants\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\" and Jobseekers Allowance payments have been unexpectedly split for an unknown number of claimants\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\" and Jobseekers Allowance payments have been unexpectedly split for an unknown number of claimants\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\" and Jobseekers Allowance payments have been unexpectedly split for an unknown number of claimants\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\" and Jobseekers Allowance payments have been unexpectedly split for an unknown number of claimants\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\" and Jobseekers Allowance payments have been unexpectedly split for an unknown number of claimants\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"CommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsThe error has paid out both sickness benefit Employment and Support Allowanceand Jobseekers Allowance\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA suspected technical glitch in the benefits system means families across the country have been getting some of their money early. The error has paid out both sickness benefit Employment and Support Allowanceand Jobseekers Allowance to people across the country. Usually, both those benefits are paid in one lump sum fortnightly. But many claimants who were due to be paid next week have received half their payment already. The Department for Work and Pensionsattempted to calm fears today by insisting everyone will get the second half of their payment on the correct day.  It is understood the glitch extends to an unknown number of benefit claimants spread throughout all regions of the UK, including Northern Ireland. One claimant tweeted: Id hoped Theresa May had decided we should get an Xmas bonus! Another complained the payment came with no explanation, no solution, no help. Guidance on the DWPs website confirms: If your ESA payment is due in the week starting  January , you might be paid half of it early in the week starting  December .

MPs are due to vote on her pact in the week starting January . But former Brexit Secretary David Davis believes the crunch Commons showdown could be shelved againMrs May is heading for defeat.  His comments come as the PM prepares to meet EU leaders and seek further “clarications” in a bid to persuade sceptical MPs to back her deal. But a spokeswoman for EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said bloc leaders “have been very clear that it will not be renegotiated, what is on the table”. Blasting the PM’s pact, Mr Davis wrote in the : “The withdrawal agreement does not respect the referendum result. “That is why the meaningful vote had to be delayed and one wonderseven the January vote will go ahead. “Attempts to frighten MPs into supporting it are unlikely to work, because voting down this substandard deal will not result in no Brexit.”  A survey of Tory members reveals the struggle Mrs May faces to convince her own party to back her plan. Opposition to the deal among activists outweighs support by % to %, according to the Party Members Project for Queen Mary University of London and Sussex University. Some % think her agreement fails to respect the result of the  referendum, with % saying it does. In another hammer blow to her bid to force the deal through Parliament, only % of Tory members would vote for it, compared to % who would vote to quit without a pact. Mrs May, who has admitted she will not fight another general election, hoped MPs would rally round her pact after meeting constituents over Christmas.  But the survey suggests opposition among activists is even stronger than on her own backbenches. Professor Tim Bale, of Queen Mary University London, said: “It would be fair to say that the Tory grassroots are,not obsessed, then consumed by Brexit. “But what is really striking is how little support there is at the Tory grassroots for Mrs May’s deal. “Generally, Conservative Party members, like most voters of whatever ilk, think the government has made a mess of negotiating Brexit.” Ministers have denied claims they are trying to drum up support for the PM’s plan by running “Project Fear II” after issuing a series of warnings highlighting the risks of crashing out without a deal. But Prof Bale said: “Tory members – like Tory voters – are utterly unconvinced, despite their own government’s best recent efforts, that a no-deal Brexit would cause serious disruption. “Some % of voters currently intending to support the Conservatives think the warnings are ‘exaggerated or invented’ – a figure that rises to % among Tory members. “Meanwhile, those members are convinced by a margin of % to % that leaving without a deal would have a positive rather than a negative effect on Britain’s economy in the medium to long term.” He added: “Mrs May has failed not only to convince the country and quite probably Parliament that her Brexit deal is a good one, she has also failed to convince the party faithful.” Environment Secretary Michael Gove highlighted the risks of no-deal departure again yesterday. The “turbulence which will be generated by our departure without a deal would be considerable”, he told the Oxford Farming Conference. Tarfs, border checks, potential delays for recognising certain organic products and labour pressures would add to food producers’ costs. “Nobody can be blithe or blase about the real impacts on food producers in this country of leaving without the deal,” said the leading Brexiteer. “It would hit worst those who are our smaller farmers and farm businesses.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ros wynne jones amber rudd","story":"NewsopinionRos Wynne-Jones: Amber Rudd should make ending Tory welfare cruelty her resolutionAmber Rudds tweet about welfare came on same day the Mirror revealed Dean Lovell-Payne tried to take his own le while on the phone to the DWP - after waiting  weeks for his Universal Credit to arriveShareCommentsByRos Wynne JonesReal Britain columnist:,  JAN NewsopinionAmber Rudd tweeted about a fairer welfare system - but any changes will have come too late for Dean \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAfter a record-breaking shyChristmas for foodbanks, there came this tweet from Amber Rudd, the new Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. “Not usually one for New Year’s Resolutions,” the former Home shySecretary wrote, “but here are mine + one hope… Make our welfare system work better and fairer for women. Help claimants into work and shyfinancial independence. Get help more quickly to those who need it. Less violent discourse in our politics.” Her tweet came the same day the Mirror revealed former ambulance worker Dean Lovell-Payne tried to take his own le while on the phone to the DWP after waiting a staggering  weeks for his first Universal Credit payment to arrive. Dean’s le had been changed by a fall – something that could happen to anyone.   But, cruelly, he was left thinking his le insurance would pay out more quickly than the DWP to support his we and kids. Of all the Christmases since the Tories turbocharged austerity in  – the ones with the bedroom tax, and cuts to Personal Independence Payments and Disability Living shyAllowance – this may have been the cruellest Christmas yet. The first for millions on Universal Credit. Not only were people forced to spend the festive season with empty cupboards due to the built in “five-week wait”, but Universal Credit has introduced “conditionality” – i.e. shysanctions – to millions who have never experienced it before. That’s one of the things making UC a hostile environment for claimants.   The stories of that cruelty are only just beginning, but given they will apply to more and more people,  looks set to be a story of hunger and poverty for more people. This year, despite having just been told by UN shyrapporteur Professor Philip Alston that the UK’s high child poverty rate was “not just a disgrace, but a social calamity and an economic disaster, all rolled into one”, the Tories will use Brexit as a reason not to do anything to change the misery austerity is wreaking via welfare reform. They will say there’s no shyparliamentary time, and no political “oxygen” left. This is particularly stupid – or clever – given that how millions of people feel about Brexit is directly defined by how hopeless and worthless they feel they and their community are to the elites running the country.   Since the vote in , the Government has had two years to soften austerity, but has done nothing apart from spout some empty jam-tomorrow rhetoric about just- about-managing families. As a Remainer, Rudd might want to think hard about this. Her tweet suggests there is some kind of rocket science to making the welfare system fairer or getting help to people more quickly. The fact is Iain Duncan Smith’s reforms were conceived to make the welfare system less fair – harsher, more cruel. They were specically designed to get help to people more slowly – that’s why there’s a five- week wait. To save the welfare bill five weeks of money per person. It’s not some mysterious alchemy. It’s pretty easy to do some immediate things. Rudd’s first five quick-fix new year’s shyresolutions should be to stop the five-week wait, restore the work allowance in UC, drop sanctions across the benefit system, pause UC rollout, and reverse cuts to disabled people. All this would see foodbanks closing, not opening. Rudd is already shyremembered for one hostile shyenvironment after she was forced to resign amid the Windrush scandal. The Tories have been at it again over Christmas. Talking up the arrival of a small number of people arriving by boat to the UK the way Donald Trump talks up the “migrant caravan” in America. It creates a perception of a deluge of migrants. This is no longer Rudd’s shydepartment. But she has the chance to do shysomething about the Tories’ other most hostile environment – for shystruggling people who need the support of the welfare state. Leaver Iain Duncan Smith has helped his Brexit cause with his brutal “reforms”. The hard lives people are living were one of the key motivators for people to vote for Brexit. When you have nothing, you have nothing to lose by a radical overhaul of our contract with the world. Hostility breeds more hostility. Rudd may have done the Tory right’s dirty work at the Home Office but she’s not a wild-eyed ideologue. It may be there is too little time left now to make a dference. But opening the taps and softening austerity is the way to a softer Brexit. Meanwhile, ending austerity and giving people and communities hope for the future, attacking the causes of the first Brexit vote, is the only path to a second referendum. Perhaps that’s what Rudd’s tweet was about. Meanwhile, she did get one thing right. As we begin a new year afresh, we should all sign up to her final new year’s resolution, “less violent discourse in our politics”.

The Prime Minister’s bid to shore-up backing for her Brussels pact was looking increasingly fruitless after she hosted the party’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds in No. Downing Street had hoped for a breakthrough, but he emerged saying: “The withdrawal agreement, as currently proposed, flies in the face of the government’s commitments on Northern Ireland as we leave the EU.” EU leaders crushed chances of offering Mrs May concessions to win over the DUP and her own backbenchers. She wants reassurances the Irish backstop - designed to prevent checks on the -mile frontier between the North and the Republic under a no-deal departure - will not be indefinite.  Torpedoing the bid, EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker’s spokeswoman said: “We are not renegotiating what is on the table. “Our solutions are on the table, we are ready to listen but at this stage there are no further meetings and the EU  leaders have been very clear that it will not be renegotiated what is on the table.” Mr Juncker “reiterated very clearly that we have put all the solutions on the table and now it is up the British people and MPs to decide on the next steps”, in an interview last month, she added. Meanwhile, speaking after talks with German counterpart Angela Merkel, Irish PM Leo Varadkar piled the pain on Mrs May. He said: “We’re happy to offer reassurances and guarantees to the UK, but not reassurances and guarantees that contradict or change what was agreed back in November.”  Admitting he had “given up speculating at this stage” on potential Brexit outcomes, he said it was a problem triggered by the UK. “We’re really looking to them for a solution,” he said. “It’s up to them to make a proposal but it has to be a proposal that we can accept. “It can’t be a proposal that contradicts what’s already in the withdrawal agreement. “It can’t be something that renders the backstop inoperable.” Mr Dodds warned his party would not support the current plan. He said: “The backstop is not the best of both worlds. “It is potentially indefinite in time, would place a barrier between us and our main trading partner in Great Britain and give enormous leverage to the EU in negotiations on the future relationship with the UK. “We will have further discussions with the Prime Minister and will continue to work with the government is interests of getting a better deal.” "},{"url":null,"title":"what its like live 60","story":"NewsWhat its like to live on £ a week under the governments miners pension schemeMore than £.billion has been taken out of the Mineworkers Pension Scheme - while former colliers live on as little as £ a week.

This is the situation thousands of former miners and colliers found themselves in when, after years of back-breaking work, they were finally able to retire. Now three former colliers have spoken of the reality of living on as little as pound per week from the miners pension scheme in moving testimony, originally published by WalesOnline. In recent years the terms of the Mineworkers Pension Scheme have come under growing criticism by those who were working underground when it was decided in . Since then the government have taken more than pound. billion in surpluses out of the same pot - and will take pound million more over the next three years. Unbeknown to many, the situation with the Mineworkers Pension Scheme began  years ago when British Coal was privatised.  At the time, ministers agreed the Government would act as guarantor for two pension schemes - The Mineworkers Pension Scheme, boasting , members, and the British Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme, with , members. Under the deal, any surplus money gained from the scheme would be split   between the Treasury and scheme members. But, while it was estimated the funds would generate a pound billion surplus over  years, it has done better than expected. In November, energy minister Claire Perry revealed pound million had been taken by the Treasury in  alone. In total, the Mineworker Pension Fight claims the amount taken by the Government has reached pound billion in just over  years - while former workers receive an average pension of pound a week. At -years-old Emlyn Davies lives with his daughter and her husband. He is one of the surviving , former miners who paid .% into the scheme while working.  While the decision was made after his we Gwynneths death in , the pensioner claims he would not be able to afford to live on his own. This is because, after  years working in Penrhiwceiber Colliery he now receives pound a week. I receive pound a week. Imagine playing pound or pound a week in and you only have pound back after  years , Emlyn, known to family and friends as Em, said. When I was a young man - I started in the s - we thought we would have a good pension. Then they altered it and I thought it would be even better but it ended up not being the case. We are still poor. At -years-old, Em followed the footsteps of his father and two older brothers to begin a career in the colliery. Originally a worker on the coal face, he later moved to work with the power loading machinery. As a working father-of-five le was hard - but there were plenty of happy times. He said: When the kids were very young I was still in the pit and we had everything they wanted for Christmas.  We used to go in debt for six months after to back out of it. Thats why our family are so close - we gave them everything and they seem to share that. It wasnt a lot but we lived day to day. However, for the grandfather-of- and great-grandfather-of-, things changed once he hit retirement age. He said: After I retired all together it was a struggle. We couldnt live on the money we were given, every year we would go to the bank and borrow pound, with interest and everything. Thats why we decided to sell the house and move into council rented accommodation. We lost our house - we had to sell it because we couldnt afford the repairs. Now Ive got a good family around me and my daughter and her husband have taken me on. After I lost my we I took it badly. ButI was living on my own now I wouldnt be able to survive. At -years-old, former Oakdale colliery worker Ken Sullivan took the decision to retire after undergoing triple bypass surgery. His career in the colliery also started at the age of  when he began to support his father who was a prisoner of war during World War Two. Now, he receives pound a week from the scheme, alongside his state pension. Ken, who has lived in the same house in Tredegar since he was born, said: People think it is a good amount but when you contemplate what you have paid in its not that much. My we budgets everything down to the last penny. Theres only certain things we can buy and certain things we cant but you get used to it. We dont go out - my we last went out three years ago. For the -year-old, the hardest part is not being able to take his whole family on holiday each year. He said: With Christmas we make sure we have a good time and are not going without but there are one or two extra things we cant get. Im only getting half the pension I should - an extra pound would make a huge dference. For Ken, reality hit home this winter home while watching BBC drama Care - which charted the dficulties of a woman who develops dementia after a stroke. Ken said: Its frightening to think what could become of you. Before we get to that stage it would be nice to enjoy le without worrying about every penny. Two years ago, the father and grandfather began a petition calling for the scheme to be reviewed. It now has more than , signatures. As part of his campaigning, Ken has visited every village and town in South Wales drumming up support - and has met those in situations far worse than his own. He said: In Abertillery there was an old lady and she was told she would get pound. a week as a widower. Her husband would have got pound a week. She was gutted and thought the pension was disgusting but accepted what she had. A lot of people dont realise what has taken place. What we are asking for is the pension we have paid into. We are not asking for charity, we are not asking for hand-outs, thats all we want. Between  and , Gareth Davies also worked at Oakdale Colliery. Gareth, , is thankful his situation is better than most thanks to his pound-a-month pension - arranged due to his position as collier official. Gareth, who now lives in Aberdare, said: I receive pound a month but there are many more that are on a lot less. I have heard many many sad stories, there are people that havent got a penny. I have spoken to people that have teared-up speaking about it. Ive recently separated from my we so Im living on my own and Ive got debts to pay off so its not easy. He added: The government took over our pension scheme under dubious circumstances. The ones worst off are those that left school at  and expected to retire at . Their funds have been used by the government to pay out the banks. A Government spokesman said: “The Mineworkers’ Pensions Scheme is subject to a Government Guarantee which ensures that a member’s pension, including inflation increases, will always be paid. “Members have received pensions approximately % larger than would have been the case without the Guarantee.” "},{"url":null,"title":"chris packham offers himself human","story":"NewsChris Packham offers himself as human prey to stop foxes being torn to piecesThe BBC Springwatch presenter says its time we put an end to fox hunting once and for all - and has offered himself as quarry for the New Forest Hounds in HampshireShareCommentsByRhian Lubin:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video chris-packham-end-fox-hunting-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIn a bid to stop foxes being torn to pieces, animal campaigner Chris Packham offered himself as a hunts first human quarry. The naturalist urged his local hunt in Hampshire, the New Forest Hounds, to switch to drag hunting, which involves dog tracking either a human runner or chemical scent. He says their trail hunting can still end with foxes being killed. Hunts in some parts of the UK have faced allegations the blood sport has continued under the guise of trail hunting. Chris , visited the hunt at Linwood, near Ringwood, Hants, on New Years Day and made a short film about how there is no place for it in st century Britain. In the video, he spoke generally about fox hunting in the UK. There is nothing to suggest the New Forest Hounds did anything illegal.He said: Animals are still being hunted, torn to pieces by packs of dogs in the st century. I know it’s dficult to get your head around that, we work so hard with conservation. and here we are standing in a National Park, a place where millions of people come to enjoy the countryside and it’s wildle.  And yet others are out there tearing it to pieces with dogs. We’ve got to put an end to it. Please join me in  to work harder than ever before to put an end to this horrible anachronism. Theres no place for this savagery in st century Britain. The clip was viewed over , times and shared by over ,. And despite his offer to be the hunts first human quarry, the -year-old hunt group declined, saying it would be impractical for their dogs. Labour outlawed hunting foxes with dogs in , causing NFH and other hunts to turn to trail hunting in which hounds chase an articial scent, but critics believe the sport can still result in hunts chasing a fox accidentally or deliberately. Chris added: Fox hunting is a highly emotive activity which has no place in the contemporary environment - and everyone knows that. The law is constantly contravened. Foxes are being torn to pieces in peoples front gardens and pets are being chased.  We have to make peaceful, democratic progress in ending this practice. Its very dficult to monitor fox hunting and its also very dficult when things go wrong to get a successful prosecution.Police are under-resourced and have many other things to deal with. If hunts switched to drag hunting it would have a positive impact in public relations terms as well as having a positive impact on wildle. Im not saying its the whole answer but it would be a step in the right direction. If the New Forest Hounds did that, I would be happy to be their first human quarry. A New Forest Hounds spokesman today said it would be dficult to switch to drag hunting. He said: We thank Chris Packham for his offer of being hunted by the New Forest Hounds but we dont think it would be practical. We spent a lot of time and effort in getting our hounds to switch to trail hunting. We think it would be even more dficult, perhaps even impossible, to get them to switch to drag hunting. It would go against  years of breeding. Chris Pitt, deputy director of campaigns at the League Against Cruel Sports, added: Wild animals, including foxes, hare and deer, are still being chased to exhaustion before being torn to pieces. There is strong support for British wildle being given robust protection from those who kill for sport How can we call ourselves a civilised nation when those who gain entertainment from attacking wildle continue to go unpunished by the law  You can sign a petition supported by Chris here.

Currently Bristol City Councils planning policy does not allow the building new single-occupier homes. This is because the local authority recommends that at least two bed spaces should be made available and room for additional visitors in every new property.However, proposals for three tiny one-bed, one-person homes in the Hillfields area have recently been approved. An existing two-story Victorian building will be ided into two flats. And a new pop-up Snug home will be created in the rear garden of an existing house.At sqm to sqm, the ground-floor flat, first-floor flat and prefabricated box house all meet or exceed minimum internal floor space requirements under UK housing standards.  Each home will have its own little grassy space, and two of them will have a small patio as well. And while only one new Snug house has been approved so far, it could lead to the roll out of future homes. Planning committee members approved the new homes after developer Ecomotive urged them to “stand up and make new precedents” to help solve Bristol’s housing crisis. But council officers had recommended that councillors reject the plans, arguing that the proposed one-person homes do not provide enough room for everyday activities. An officer said: “Bristol does not accept one-bed spaces because they cannot accommodate extra residents should the need arise. “Bristol City Council expects that all new dwellings provide at least two bed spaces. “It is considered that this is the smallest unit size that can meet the flexibility and adaptability of the policies outlined, i.e., accommodate sufficient space for a partner, a child, temporary carer or visiting friends or relatives.” But Michelle Asher from Ecomotive, which is developing the Snug home design, disagreed. She said: “I’d hate to see Bristol City Council turn down a totally viable living option which addresses the need for affordable housing, small footprints, enough space for people to live comfortably and with dignity and the right to choose just based on limiting bureaucratic regulations.”  The council’s development manager, Gary Collins, advised councillors to change local planning policynecessary rather than make a habit of overruling it. Councillors backed the house conversion by nine votes to two before unanimously approving the “Snug” prefab home in the rear garden. The planning report reads: The dwelling itself is proposed to be a two storey,  bedroom,  bed space dwelling with an overall gross internal floor area of approximately sqm, ided over its two storeys. The dwelling would be .m in height and adopt a modern box   SNUG home design with a flat roof. Amenity space would be provided through a small patio areato the rear of the proposed dwelling and an area of grassachieved through the subision of the existing garden at  Forest Road. No members of the public had objected to either application and  wrote in support of the prefab home. Mr Collins added that the council is developing a new policy approach to modular units.

HGV driver Richard Hook, , watched in horror as a man riding a bike with a small child sitting on the back, decided to overtake a lorry on a roundabout.  Richards dashcam captured the shocking incident which occurred in Weybridge, Surrey. The footage begins with Richard, from Winchester, driving down Church Street in Weybridge. He comes to a halt at a roundabout, just as another lorry begins approaching from the other direction. A loud horn can be heard in the video, as a cyclists darts out in front of the lorry and across the roundabout.  Richard begins shouting at the cyclist - who isnt wearing a helmet and has a young child sat on the back of his bike. Thankfully the child does have a helmet on. The lorry driver proceeds to share his shock through a series of expletives: F*** me! F***ing hell! He adds: Got a bit shaken up there.  The cyclist continues over the roundabout without stopping and then heads onto Balfour Road. Richard recently uploaded the clip to a Facebook dashcam group, where it has since been viewed hundreds of times. He captioned the video, saying: Dad of the year, apologies in advance for bad language. Outraged by the footage, many people took the time to comment and share their thoughts on the cyclist.

The adventurous four-year-old would probably try to tackle the slide in Winter Wonderland on his own but both his legs were amputated after he was abused by his birth parents when he was just weeks old. His birth parents were later jailed thanks to the tireless work of Tonys adoptive parents, Paula and Mark Hudgell, who pushed to have them prosecuted after the Crown Prosecution Serviceinitially dropped the case.  The family of  took a trip to Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park, London, to celebrate the New Year. Paula said: Winter Wonderland was magical. Tony particularly loved the Ice Kingdom which was like walking into a giant freezer with lots of ice sculptures everywhere. He went down the ice slide on his brothers, Jaden and Henrys, laps. And his face lit up when he watched Peter Pan on Ice which he loved. He was sitting right at the front.  Four years ago, little Tonys le was effectively saved by Christmas. The baby was admitted to hospital with multiple organ failure, numerous fractures and sepsis. After a six week battle to save him, doctors made the dficult decision just before Christmas, , to withdraw all but palliative care. But in an extraordinary twist of fate, doctors were unable to stop treatment because Tony was a ward of court – and the courts had closed for Christmas. Those few days gave him the chance to fight for his le and he amazed doctors by rallying. Weeks later, he was fostered by the Hudgells and his le took a dramatic turn for the better.  Now Christmas is an extra-special time for the whole family. Paula said: Tony was so excited for Christmas. He said it was his best day ever. He loved it all. Santa brought him lots of presents and he loved being with the whole family. Now having celebrated a wonderful Christmas together Paula has said that her New Year resolution is to continue to fight for vulnerable children and to build more protection for children into British law. The resolute mum-of-eight from Kent started a petition calling for tougher sentences for child cruelty and quickly collected more than , signatures of support. Her MP, Tom Tugendhat, will present the petition to the House of Commons on January, , and together they hope to change the law in baby Tonys name.  Paula said: This year I will continue to fight for all children until we get tougher sentences for anyone who hurts them. Increased sentences will make no dference to Tony now but hopefully it will help future children.  Too many children are abused and neglected and something needs to be done to stop that. Despite Tonys horric start in le, he has been thriving under the Hudgells care, changing from a broken little boy to a confident, smiling child with big brown eyes that just melt your heart, Paula, , said.  Nothing stops him now. Hes really fast getting around and hes caught up cognitively with all his peers.

Tanya Evans, , was living in agony for years after the mysterious growth appeared out of the blue one day in . However she postponed surgery while she desperately tried for a baby with her fiance Mark Jenkins, . Just as she was giving up hope Tanya fell pregnant with Josie, who was born in December . Since then she has had a major operation in April  to remove the bowel - which was pushing through her abdominal wall causing the hernia. Her rectum and anus had also been irreparably damaged following a prolapse and she is still battling with daily pain.  Tanya, of Swansea, South Wales, said: “I still struggle every day, with the simplest of tasks. “Mark has to help me shower and I can barely lt anything. That means I can’t pick Josie up for a cuddle, which is heartbreaking. “She’s too young to understand, so she thinks it’s because she’s been naughty. The physical side of things has been hard, but the mental has been absolute torture.” Tanyas nightmare began back in , when she was raced to hospital with a severe bowel obstruction. Gravely ill, her skin turned yellow and she even vomited up faeces. She explained: “I was vomiting up something black, which tasted disgusting. Medics tested it and told me it was faeces. I was absolutely terried.”  Forced to have an ileostomy, where the small bowel, or intestine, is erted through an opening in the abdomen, Tanya was left with a stoma bag. Its designed to collect waste that would ordinarily be passing through the large intestine and out of the body. Despite a few weeks of colic – abdominal pain – she felt relatively well, and was hopeful she would make a full recovery. But one day later in , a hernia appeared. According to the NHS,it occurs when an internal part of the body, in Tanya’s case her bowel, pushes through a weakness in the muscle or surrounding wall. She said: “I had it checked over, and confirmed as a hernia. At first, I was reassured it could be easily sorted out – but then, I also began to bleed from my bottom.” Further investigations revealed that Tanya was suffering from ersion colitis, and inflammation of the colon, which can occur as a complication of surgery.  Given pain medication as well as steroid enemas to calm the inflammation, she faced another knockback when she realised that surgery to remove the growth could cause fertility issues. Doctors warned that,the womb was affected too, a hysterectomy may be necessary. With a waiting list for the procedure anyway, doctors agreed she should take the chance to try for a baby while she could. “Mark and I tried and tried and I cried at every negative test,” she said. “I started to fear it would never happen for us, but then, we conceived. “Josie was born on December ,  three weeks early, weighing lb oz. She had to be delivered via caesarean, due to the hernia, but she was happy and healthy.” After recovering from childbirth, Tanya met with a team of medics, and her surgery was pencilled in for August . She continued: “But then August came and went, then September, then October. I was told there were no beds available, which I understand happens, but what was I supposed to do  I felt like I was dying. “Then, at the end of the year, I discovered the surgeon who was meant to be doing my operation was retiring, so no longer available. I was terried I’d be back at square one, on another wait list to see another doctor.  “I contacted the patient liaison department and they kept asking what they could do to help. But all anyone could do was wait for a cancellation to come up. So, I fought and fought.” As she waited, Tanya’s hernia continued to grow, eventually reaching lb. She added: “It affected everything I did, and put so much pressure on my body. Sitting down hurt, standing up hurt – everything. “It even bruised my legs where it’d bang against my thigh. At its worst, it would twist and strangulate, where the blood supply to the intestines and abdominal tissues gets cut off.” Eventually, in April , Tanya went under the kne. Though she did not have a hysterectomy, surgeons did remove her bowel, rectum and anus, which had been damaged by a prolapse – where organs fall down, or slip out of place. Adding that, since the hernia was removed, she has gone from a size  to a , she continued: “Apparently, where the strangulated hernia had cut off the blood supply, my bowel was just completely dead, and the tissue was virtually disintegrated.  “Once they saw the damage that’d been going on inside, medics couldn’t believe I’d been walking around. “It’s not that I have a high pain threshold, though. I’ve just become used to the pain, which is very sad.” When she first came round, Tanya admitted she could not bear to look at her scar, which she said resembled a shark bite. Now, still wearing a bag attached to her stoma to collect waste, she is hoping to also have tummy tuck surgery to remove the baggy skin where it was stretched over the hernia. With a hysterectomy still a consideration in the future, depending on how her regular check ups go, she said: “When people hear tummy tuck, they assume it’s because I want to look good.But it’s actually because I have been left with saggy skin, that can hang down and make my bag leak. “Le is very dferent for me now. I have to be incredibly careful just moving around, as one awkward fall could split my stitching and hospitalise me. I still sit on an air cushion every day, too, as sitting down without is simply too painful. “I don’t want anybody  to go through this, so I am urging others out there to keep pushing and fighting for helpthey need it.”  Jo Davies, Assistant Service Group Manager, Surgical Specialties for Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board, which covers Swansea, said: In line with other health boards in Wales, we continue to experience signicant challenges in providing routine urgent elective surgery.We are taking ongoing action to reduce theof time patients are waiting for surgery. This includes the appointment of new consultant surgeons, the outsourcing of appropriate patients to private hospitals, and additional theatre sessions. Waiting lists are also reviewed weekly to ensure patients with the highest clinical needs are given priority. Ms Evans did not meet the clinical criteria for outsourcing and required an inpatient bed in one of our hospitals. However, as always, we have to give priority to patients with le limb-threatening conditions, cancer and trauma patients. Unfortunately as a result of this we were unable to offer Ms Evans an earlier date, though we are very pleased her surgery went ahead earlier this year.

The entrepreneur launched Killing Kittens in , hosting members-only orgies at a number of plush venues in the UK and the US. Events are for beautul people to explore their sexuality, where party members have to pass a strict vetting system and must be ‘gorgeous’ before they will be admitted. But over the festive period Emma revealed that Christmas was officially cancelled for her and her two other young children. The mum, who is also a practising Christian, told MailOnline: We thought we were going to lose her. I’ve never been so scared in my le.

A wide-eyed Katie turns to face the camera while opening presents in what would be one of the last photos ever taken of her alive. Under the image, her heartbroken mum, Alison Rough, wrote: This was her very last Christmas. We spoilt her rotten. Im so glad we did. I could never say no to her xxx. Katie was just seven-years-old when a neighbour found her leless and bleeding, lying on the grass in a playing field less than one mile from her home in York, on January, , .  She had been smothered with a glove before her killer used a Stanley kne to make a cm slash to her neck and a cm wound to her torso, which cut through fat, skin and muscle, prosecutors said at the trial at Leeds Crown Court in . Katie’s mum Alison, then , raced to the scene and dropped to her knees screaming: “No, no, my little girl,” before trying to cradle her head. Katie was rushed to hospital but was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.  A teenage girl, who Katie had been playing with before her death, was found covered in blood in a nearby cul-de-sac, clutching a kne while calling  to admit to the killing. She was later charged with manslaughter and jailed for le. The death of the little girl, who had been a bridesmaid at her parents wedding just two weeks earlier, sent shock-waves through the community. The disturbed girl who killed her was -years-old at the time and she cannot be named for legal reasons. She pleaded guilty to Katies manslaughter by diminished responsibility, but not guilty to murder.  Mr Justice Soole, who presided over the trial, said that the defendant posed a high risk of serious harm to others and to yourself before sentencing her. He said it was a truly exceptional case and ordered her to be detained for a minimum of five years. In the months before the attack, Katies killer had expressed disturbing thoughts - from grisly dreams and acts of self harm to the mutilation of a toy. She lost most of her school friends and developed an interest in the macabre as her mental health deteriorated ahead of the pre-planned killing.  Often very upset, the teenager experienced delusional and bizarre thoughts, the court heard during her trial. She became convinced that people around her werent human and were robots. She also dreamed of killing someone and reported hearing voices inside her head, according to one friend, who described the teenager as nice but weird.  She had been taken out of school due to the severity of her mental health problems and was under the care of a mental health team. The girls mental health issues escalated over the course of more than a year until, in January, she smothered Katie on the playing field and then slashed at her body. Post-mortem results showed Katie died from asphyxiation, with her wounds inflicted after her death. Pathologists found that a gloved hand was held over her face to suffocate her before she had her neck and torso slashed.

Eight weeks later, the -year-old nursery cook went on her first date since he died. Although it didnt progress into a relationship, Natalie claims the criticism she faced then and still faces today has been devastating. Despite receiving support from most of her family, Natalie said that she had a hard time from friends and family - especially those on Tims side. Now happily married for the second time after finding love online, Natalie is speaking to encourage others to stop being so judgemental about love after berevement. Natalie, from Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, said: When Tim took ill in the August, they told me pretty early on what the outcome was going to be. I did my grieving in those four months while he was still here. I knew what was coming and I had to stay strong for our son Oliver.  When Tim died, my friends didnt call because they didnt know what to say, so they didnt say anything at all. I was in shock and so lonely. Eventually I got to the point where I did want to go out and so I went on a date with a local man. It didnt go anywhere but it caused people to say I had disrespected my husband. I had every respect for him - but I knew he was never coming back. I couldnt sit alone in my house crying. I went out and enjoyed myself for a few weeks. People avoid you when a loved one dies. Soon after Tim passed away I was walking down the street and people would cross over because they didnt know what to say. You do feel isolated. If you havent been through it you can never understand. [Finding love again] doesnt mean Ive no respect for Tim. Some people were judgemental, especially at work. I had got a job after he passed. People would say its only been two years but Id say exactly. Do you want me to sit on the sofa wearing black and never go out  People are so quick to judge. Its not right. In the summer prior to his death, Tim and Natalie had been on holiday to Spain with their four-year-old son Oliver while Tim did some painting work.  The couple were away for a week but days into the trip, Natalie noticed her husband was behaving really weird and had been acting daft. A desperate Natalie even called her dad saying she wanted to come home and when the family ed to the UK, Tim visited the doctors. Natalie said: We went on holiday in  to Spain which is when Tim started behaving really weird. Hed be walking with his head on the side orI gave him his lunch on a plate, hed look at me and tip it all on the floor. Wed gone over there because hed agreed to do some work on a villa.  As the week went on, he hadnt done any painting and was just behaving really daft. I began to notice something wasnt right. When we got back, I took him straight to the doctors and they thought hed had a stroke. He went into hospital that night and he was soon diagnosed with a brain tumour. The specialists said that because wed been on holiday the air pressure on the plane had accelerated the tumour. He went to The Christie in Manchester but there was nothing they could do. They gave him chemotherapy but it wasnt doing anything at all. I did mourn. From getting the brain tumour, each of the words that came out Tims mouth you couldnt take seriously. It was like talking to an older person with dementia. He wanted me to be happy and move on.  That December, Natalie scrambled around to afford Christmas presents for Oliver as her husband lay in his hospice bed. During what should have been a happy time of year, she agonised over how to tell her little boy that his dad might not make it through the month. Natalie said: It was horrendous, especially during that Christmas. I was trying to keep things jolly for Oliver but I was struggling for money. Sadly Tim was soon transferred to a hospice. He couldnt speak or move around. It was just terrible. Oliver understood what was happening. He asked me is my daddy going to die . I could have lied and said no. But I sat him down and explained in terms a four-year-old would be able to understand. Tim had been the breadwinner and Id been at home with Oliver, so people rallied round us to make sure he got some Christmas presents. Tim survived through Christmas but the week later he went downhill. On New Years Day  he passed away.  Suffering with the crippling loneliness and grief, Natalie decided to begin dating again just eight weeks later. However when her first dates didnt come to anything, she focused on helping her son Oliver come to terms with losing his dad. By , Natalie decided to get out there once again and started dating again. Although it was almost two years since Tim had died, Natalie claims she was still judged by family and colleagues - even after her she married Paul  months later. Natalie said: At the end of  I joined Plenty of Fish and thats where I met Paul. It was a happy ending. Paul is a lovely man and from the start I told him the whole story. I explained I had a son and he might be sensitive to the situation, but Oliver took to him straight away. It just progressed from there and soon it became our new normal. When we got married it was really sweet.  At the wedding reception looked up at us and said can I play out  He ran over to Paul and said Daddy, can we play out . Oliver still talks about Tim. He has his watch and we speak about him everyday - night and day. Oliver is now eight years old. A lot of people, especially family, we dont speak to. Tim had older children - he was  years older than me. He had five, including Oliver. Im still in contact with two of them now. They were really supportive from the beginning and came to my wedding in the evening. [Some other people on Tims side of the family were] really unsupportive and quite disrespectful. When Natalie got a new job as a nursery cook, she was also questioned about how quickly she had found a new partner. Despite losing some friends and family, Natalie claimed her own family were there for her and believes Oliver was helped by seeing her smile again. Natalie said: I just feel like [those that criticised me about starting to date again] need to take a step back and think. God forbidthey were in that position. You just cant say that. I did join Plenty of Fish but I didnt go out looking for love. I still post about him. I posted on Facebook on New Years Day last year its been nearly three years since you passed and I hope that youre looking down on me on my wedding day. I got a lot of comments - none to my face. My family were so supportive. I think its helped Oliver to see his mum happy again.

The Queens granddaughter impressed fashion lovers with her gorgeous wedding dress, designed by Peter Pilotto and Christopher de Vos, which showed off the scars from her scoliosis operation. For the black tie evening reception she changed into a stunning blush coloured dress by Zac Posen, and she looked the perfect princess. But Eugenie opted for a very dferent look for the second day of her wedding weekend, and the designer behind the look has described it as unusual. The couple had a festival and funfair themed party on the Saturday, complete with cocktails, rides and a live performance from Ellie Goulding.  Designer Sam Dougal created a short white dress and a Pink Ladies style jacket with Mrs Brooksbank embroidered across the back. The design is in Eugenies handwriting. Sam said: The look is an exciting and unusual one for a royal wedding, and had to go with the feel of the day. The three of us worked on possible ideas and directions and decided to go with a young and super fun aesthetic. Much like Eugenie, the look is totally unique, and full of fun. Its a simple party dress with a modern jacket.  The jacket keeps it young and modern and doesnt take itself too seriously. And to imagine a royal bride in a biker jacket celebrating her wedding at Windsor Castle – its fun and unexpected. Jack and Eugenie tied the knot at St Georges Chapel in Windsor in October, the same venue Prince Harry and Meghan Markle picked for their wedding. Despite being further down the royal line, the couples wedding was much bigger than the Sussexes, with  guests including a host of celebrities. Prince George and Princess Charlotte acted as page boy and bridesmaid on the special day.

Residents, fearing the health risks of an infestation of rats, have had to make repeated visits to the tip to dump their rubbish. Some have had to resort to using private firms to take away the waste. Now there are serious concerns that once-monthly trial schemes could be rolled out across the UK. In September, Conwy in North Wales became the first council in England and Wales to start emptying bins only every four weeks, hoping to save some pound, a year.   Local Neill Scullard said his general waste bin was picked up on the Friday before Christmas and will not be collected again until January . He said: “The black bin for non-recyclable waste is the real problem – the waste has been piling up. “You can see tears in the plastic where the rats have been. Where there is rubbish, there will be rats.” The dad-of-two, from Penmaenmawr, near Conwy, added: “By the time the next collection comes, the bins will be horric. I’ve already done three trips to the tip. “We have been paying pound more council tax this year for less services.”   Chef Neill, , has three green recycling boxes, for plastic and cans, one for cardboard and glass, and one for paper. These are emptied fortnightly. He has a food-waste bin and a nappy bin, both tended to weekly. But it is the once-a-month general waste that is the issue. Some families have reportedly paid up pound a year to private firms who provide weekly collections.   But Conwy County Borough Council claim that for the majority of people “four-weekly bin collections are no problem”. It says a two-year trial scheme saw a % increase in recycling rates and added it has Welsh Government target to meet by  . Neighbouring Denbighshire County Council plan monthly collections in  and nearby Anglesey is also considering the switch.Today is known as ‘fly-tipping Friday’ – the worst day of the year for illegal dumping of waste."},{"url":null,"title":"students blind date goes viral","story":"NewsStudents blind date goes viral after astonishingly dferent interpretationsDanny Tapper and Sophia Kypriotis interviews about the evening appeared in the Newcastle University student paper, The CourierShareCommentsByDanya BazaraaNews Reporter:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsSophia revealed her interpretation of how the evening went \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pair of Newcastle University students who went on a blind date have gone viral after their astonishingly dferent interpretations of the evening.

She said: I really dont like to talk politics when Ive just met someone and stayed as calm as I could and I tried to educate him on his rather misogynist views. He called feminism toxic which allowed women to behave as sla**. I found this very insulting and I was actually very offended.

Laura Kreuzter, , from Selm, Germany, first met the love of her le three years ago on a bus that she took every day. Kai Semmelmann,  was the bus driver and after locking eyes several times in the rear-view mirror, Laura plucked up the courage to speak to him. She tracked him down on Facebook and a couple of days later, the pair met for a coffee and fell head-over-heals. The -year age gap didnt worry Laura at all, but Kai was slightly apprehensive at first as he was worried about what people would think of them.  Lauras parents were not impressed by her relationship and didnt talk to her for a year when they first got together and still refuse to speak to Kai today. Despite this, the couple live together and have been through more than most after Kai suffered a heart attack in April last year. Kai said: My girlfriend Laura always had to travel by bus and she would always take my bus.She thought that I was really nice but she didnt care to talk to me very much.  But one day, she wrote to me on Facebook and we met a few days later for a coffee and then fell in love with each other. It was love at first sight. Laura loved my looks and personality right from the start and the same goes for me. We were attracted to each other from the start. Our age dference is twenty-two-years and for Laura, this was not a problem but I struggled because of what people might think of us. Lauras parents were so outraged and the contact between Laura and her parents was put on ice. After about a year, Lauras mother ed to Laura and started talking to her again. I still have no contact with Lauras family, because they do not want to accept me.  Laura said: For me, it was a very bad situation because parents should actually be happytheir daughter is happy and they are at their happiest when in a relationship. It was terrible because Kai is the love of my le. When Kai had his heart attack, I was with him for every second and I supported him wherever I could. I was scared to death that I would lose him and I wouldnt have been able to handle that so I helped him where I could. Laura and Kai do receive funny looks when they are out and about in public but they are now looking forward to moving into a new apartment at the start of the year.  I suffered a heart attack in April  and that was very bad for Laura because I could not work. I had to visit a rehab centre in Ennepetal so she was heavily burdened during this time and wasnt expecting something like this to happen because she was so young, said Kai. We have been living together for almost three years now and have finally found a new apartment and move into it at the beginning of the year.  There are people who say nothing but give us stupid and contemptuous looks when they see us out and about. There are also people who look the other way and there are the people who smile when they see us. Our message to the rest of the world and to the people who criticise us, we have love to give each other and no one in the world is going to stop that.

But as  dawns and its time to go back to school and work, the sagging branches are looking a bit sad and rooms are feeling just a bit too crammed full. Theres probably more pine needles on the floor than on the lower boughs, and that traditional Christmas tree smell has all but faded. You may have already taken them down, but the tradition, since the Victorian era, is to remove decorations on Twelfth Night. Every year this very tradition causes confusion, as people are left scratching their heads wondering when the date falls and why. Heres the answers and the date when you should take down your decorations. When is Twelfth Night   Depending on what youre celebrating its either January  or January  - and the last day you should keep festive decorations up. A day sooner or later is considered unlucky anddecorations are not removed on Twelfth Night then according to tradition they should stay up all year. Until the th century though, people would keep their decorations up until Candlemas Day on February . Twelfth Night falls on January  and Epiphany on January . Twelfth Night is so called because traditionally Christmas was a  day celebration, beginning on December . This can create some confusion as some will class January  as Twelfth Night because it is the th day after Christmas. Epiphany marks the end of Christmas when the Three Kings came to visit bearing gts, guided by the star which is now represented in the twinkling lights adorning our homes. Why is it unlucky   January  is observed as the last day of Christmas festivities - the eve of the Epiphany. In the past it was believed that tree-spirits lived in the greenery – such as holly and ivy – that people used to decorate their homes. While the festive season provided shelter for these spirits during the winter, they needed to be released outside once Christmas was over. If this custom wasn’t followed, greenery would notand vegetation would not grow as a result, causing agricultural and then food problems. Even though Christmas decorations are now less about foliage and more about baubles, glitter, tinsel and singing Santas, many people still adhere to the superstition. Do all countries follow this tradition   No. Because there is disagreement as to whether January  or January  is actually Twelfth Night lots of countries end up taking down their festooned trees at dferent times. This can also depend on when people actually celebrate the festive season - for example in Russia Christmas Day falls on January . But January  is officially the day of the Epiphany. This is from the Christian tradition where the faithful mark the birth of Jesus on December . The Maji didnt arrive until much later with their gtsso Christians mark this on January . Children were traditionally told thatyou took down your decorations before the Eve of the Epiphany, the wise men might not be able to find their way - because Christmas lights represent the Star of Bethlehem which guided them to Jesus. A number of countries in Europe follow the January  tradition, including the Germans, Poles and Czechs. However for some people, simply having the decorations up into the New Year is too much and many will be taking them down on the st of January.  Real Christmas trees will be accepted at most household tips, but local authorities, garden centres and community groups may accept them for recycling. Find out where might be suitable for this in your area.  If your decorations aren’t going into a loft or attic, make sure they’re stored in a watertight, plastic box - in fact, doing this wherever they are kept will protect them from damp and pests. It’s also worth wrapping fragile Christmas ornaments in tissue paper before storage - and, of course, coiling the lights in a neat circle round your arm. Obviously the loft fairies will have tangled them into a mess by next December, but at least you can say you tried when you open them in a frazzled temper next time.  The UK is estimated to use almost , tonnes of card packaging at Christmas, enough to make a cardboard motorway stretching from Birmingham to Lapland and back  times. Recycle Now is urging consumers to recycle this material rather than bin it. Shiny and metallic ieties of wrapping paper are not recyclable, so the campaign advises people to use the ‘scrunch test’ to check. If you scrunch the paper in your hand and it stays in a ball then it can by recycled but it can’tthe paper springs back. If youre recycling bin is full, several shops such as Marks and Spencer run card recycling schemes to raise funds for charity. For every , cards dropped in to MS stores in January, a tree is planted by the Woodland Trust . Last year  million cards were collected and , trees planted.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

Vanessa Good, who heads up her own independent firm based in the town’s Newmarket Street, admits travellers need “far more clarity” over Brexit. But she this week laughed off the notion that flights will be grounded – leaving sunseekers stranded – when Britain takes a step into the unknown. It comes as fears grow that a ‘no deal’ Brexit will spark chaos at Britain’s borders and lead to untold problems for travellers. Vanessa, , who bosses the Good Travel Company, said: “There’s no doubt people are on edge at the moment. “Our customers are still coming in to book holidays in the usual numbers, but there is understandable concern. “The problem is we’re seeing so much political scaremongering and it’s hugely unsettling at a time we need far more clarity.” Vanessa, whose firm employs seven across two sites and also specialises in currency exchange, insists her team is trying to issue a note of calm to holidaymakers. She said: “We have people flying out to EU destinations on March , which is the day after Brexit, and they’re perfectly relaxed about the situation. “Others are more concerned so we’ve seen some look to other destinations as a result. “After all, the world is a lot bigger than Europe, and there will definitely be a knock-on effect in that regard. “Market experts say a no-deal will have a negative impact on the pound, and that is obviously something that nobody wants to see. “But the idea that they start grounding flights and nobody can move anywhere seems a bit far fetched. “Uncertainty will always be the biggest crippler and that is the problem facing the industry just now. “But our message to people is to continue booking their holidays as before. “In reality, it is changes like the new EU visa coming into play in , which will cost around seven euros every three years, which will be the biggest dference.” An ABTA spokesperson said: “The European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, flights will still operate between the UK and EU. “ABTA is providing holidaymakers and travellers with advice about Brexit and travel, including on pet passports and driving licences, which can be found at abta brexit.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEuropean UnionAyrHolidaysAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"woman admits acting intimidating manner","story":"NewsWoman admits to acting in intimidating mannerThe -year-old shouted, swore and acted in an aggressive and intimidating way towards Shannon Kerr.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  DEC NewsAyr Sherf Court \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman has admitted to acting in an intimidating manner.

For Deborah Biggar has just got a whole chunk smaller. The -year-old has whittled herself down to  stone  pounds - after getting too close to the  stone barrier. Deborah, of Dalmellington, revealed a Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis meant she was put on steroids at age just . Even after the first round of steroids she put on two stone. And she said: “I realised I had to do something or my weight would soon be out of control.” She’d kept active as a community support officer and loved horse riding - but had to get out the saddle as her mobility reduced.   Deborah said: “Riding was something I absolutely loved, and also walking, and with this loss of regular activity, I was definitely going to be up against keeping the weight off.” She took the plunge and joined the Coylton branch of WW . She revealed: “I turned up alone and felt very apprehensive. “Due to my illness this wasn’t an easy thing for me to do, as I can be very self-conscious and don’t often go many places on my own, but I needn’t have worried.” Class wellness coach Kellie Brown and her team quickly put Deborah at ease, and she has now only missed one workshop since joining.   During her battle her weight has snowballed up and down as her medications changed. She said: “I am delighted with my weight loss so far as I am feeling much better, not just physically, but I think more importantly, mentally I am in a better place. Going out I do not feel as self-conscious and my confidence is now a lot better. “I went to my nephew’s wedding a happier and much more confident and content person, and looked forward to it, instead of dreading going. “This is all thanks to Kellie and the group I attend at Coylton and this time I will be continuing to attend workshops to help keep me on track.” She tracks calories with an online WW app as she trawls supermarket aisles.   Deborah said: “I love the fact there are so many zero smartpoint foods, and I eat out quite regularly. As long as I track everything and make sensible decisions, I can still lose weight no problem. I sometimes choose what I’m having before I go with the help of my app. I don’t have a sweet tooth so saying no to desserts and cakes is an easy decision for me.” Fatty foods like chips and fried meals have been swapped for fruit, veg, chicken and home-made soup. Trips out are now anxiety free. She revealed: “I am no longer thinking that people are thinking she is only using a stick or scooter because she is fat but they actually see I have a disability. “With my weight loss I am on the list for the Riding for the Disabled Association, and my fingers are crossed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"make-a-date-with-sinatra-and-crosby-this-christmas-in-selkirk","story":"THERES a chance to swing your way into Christmas this weekend in Selkirk with some of the best-known festive hits.Christmas Crooners is coming to Victoria Halls on Sunday as part of their UK tour, now in its tenth record-breaking year.The show features the renowned West-End Singers performing the famous Christmas hits of all the greats, including Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Nat King Cole.They will be showcasing over  of the best-loved festive tunes, such as lsquoDeck the Hallsrsquo, lsquoChestnuts Roastingrsquo and lsquoSanta Babyrsquo, bringing some old-school Christmas glamour to the Borders.Stephen Leatherland, producer and director of the show, said: ldquoIrsquom delighted to be bringing Christmas Crooners to Selkirk and the Border region.\"This fantastic show has brought joy to many people over the last ten years and more, and we look forward to bringing a parcel of Christmas Magic to Selkirk ndash the perfect start to the festive season for young and old alike.Staged in the warm style of the famous Andy Williams Christmas Shows, this production comes complete with Christmas trees, a rocking chair and fireplace.Christmas Crooners is a community-minded event that will bring people together in the local town hall over the Christmas period to celebrate all things festive, with top-quality musicians performing Christmas classics.Hamish Moir, events and programming officer for Live Borders, said: ldquoI canrsquot think of a better way to celebrate the festive season than by heading to the local town hall for an evening of recreating the biggest Christmas hits.\"The Christmas Crooners put on a top quality performance with the West-End singers and Jazz-All-Stars, and we canrsquot wait for them to come to Selkirk for a cosy evening of live music.ldquoWe have a great series of events running over Christmas and in  that would make great gts, and I recommend looking at our website to view the full programme.\"At Live Borders we want to help make communities healthier, happier and stronger, especially at Christmas time, so come and join us on December  for these feel-good hits.Christmas Crooners will be performing in Victoria Halls, Selkirk, on Sunday at :.Tickets, priced at pound., are still available from www.eventbrite or by calling  ."},{"url":null,"title":"council-accused-of-paying-over-the-odds-for-lowood-estate","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has been told ldquoit may come to regret its decision to buy what remains of the Lowood Estate after it was revealed that government valuers advised the authority it would be paying over the odds.The council has spent pound.m on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.Council officers believe that the site, as part of a wider Tweedbank development plan, will create  permanent jobs, and a similar number during the construction phase.The site has also been earmarked for a -home housing estate.At a full meeting of the council yesterday, December , its executive member for business and economic development, Mid-Berwickshire councillor Mark Rowley, told members: ldquoThis was a project set in motion by a previous council.ldquoIn , the previous council agreed to the purchase of Lowood in principle, and over the last few years, work has been developing on this.ldquoWhat makes this incredibly important, probably more important than it was in , is that with all the talk around budgets, the council can no longer just sit back and try to carry on carrying out services.ldquoWe need to take decisive and strategic action, and this is an incredibly bold, and good, large-scale development.ldquoItrsquos maximising benefits wersquore already seeing with the Borders Railway. It strengthens the case, very strongly, for extending the railway to Carlisle, so I am incredibly supportive, as yoursquod expect. I think this helps us grow the Borders on to success.ldquoThe stats sound almost academic and meaningless, but wersquore talking about a development here of hundreds of jobs.ldquoThat is a huge leap for the Borders, especially when these better, higher-paid jobs come in. It gives us a business space of a quality which we donrsquot currently have in the Borders, and it gives us control over a potentially fantastic housing site.ldquoThis is positive and a good news story.Council officers estimate that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, Tweeddale East councillor and opposition leader Stuart Bell claims the estate is valued at much less than the council paid for it.Mr Bell also revealed that Scottish Governmentrsquos district valuation service, a body offering impartial advice on how public money is spent, also told the council the property was not worth what it has paid for it.He told members: ldquoThe Lowood Estate acquisition, which we are undertaking by ourselves, remains a tortured tale.ldquoThe pound.m outlay, plus expenses, plus cost of maintaining the land and assets, plus the cost of borrowing, means wersquoll need to sell it all for over poundm just to break even. ldquoReports we have seen in private say there will also be signicant infrastructure costs to develop the site.ldquoI donrsquot believe this site is worth pound.m when you go into the detail of the terms and conditions of the sale, and that was the opinion of the district valuer, whose assessment with vacant possession, which we will not have, was much lower than pound.m.ldquoEven when adjusted up for a special assumption, the district valuer still valued the land at a price lower than we are paying.ldquoThis is a speculative and risky expenditure of public money at a time when, quite apart from Brexit, there is shuddering uncertainty in markets. ldquoHouse prices and land values can go down as well as up. We should not be spending public money on buying this estate at this time for more than it is worth.ldquoIn what alternative opportunities could we invest poundm ldquoThis council should invest enough in roads to signicantly improve the road condition index, but we cannot afford to do that.ldquoThis council should commit to four new high schools in  years, but you wonrsquot make that commitment.ldquoI will not tell the electors in Peebles, as you will have to, that they cannot have a new high school within  years when you have tied up poundm for  or so years in Tweedbank.ldquoWe canrsquot even cut the grass properly in our cemeteries, but this administration glibly spends poundm on buying a private estate.ldquoThis is a decision I fear you may come to regret.In reply, East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton defended the deal, claiming that pressures on local government spending made such projects necessary, saying: ldquoWersquove had several briefings on this subject, and officers have presented us with an excellent paper on the future benefits of developing this site, especially with the council in control.ldquoNow councillor Bell is scaremongering about service cuts, but this is a smokescreen to keep us away from the real issue at hand, which is the financial pressure being passed down to Scottish local authorities by his SNP colleagues.ldquoScottish local councils are currently expected to continue services while facing continuous cuts.ldquoIt will be very interesting to see what opposition councillors bring to the table for their budget proposals.

water treatment work in the Borders has proved its number one when it comes to number twos, as it celebrates a green efficiency milestone.Galafoot Waste Water Treatment Plant in Galashiels has become one of Scottish Waterrsquos most self-sufficient energy sites, generating more energy than it uses.Using a technique called Combined Heat and Power , the site generates electricity from sewage sludge, the semi-solid by-product of waste water treatment.On average the Galashiels site generates more than , kWh week of renewable energy - which is enough to power  homes for a year.The site does still have to import a small amount of power to the site when the CHP needs maintained, but the consumption of imported power to the site has dropped by a dramatic two thirds since the CHP was installed three years ago.Only two operators work at the Galashiels site which processes an average  m of sludge every day. The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism.

curriculums independent of each other.A recent inspection by Education Scotland found a gap in the literacy and numeracy performance of children coming into P.The new school will follow a single curriculum anda single headteacher will be appointed to oversee its management.The decision to push ahead with the plans came despite a public consultation which found only  per cent of those who took part were in favour of the proposal, with  per cent against it.And it was revealed that while the parent council of the infant school was for the merger, the same body from the primary school had

concerns.She said: ldquoIt is really important we work with the parental community and I took part in further meetings with parents because in their minds to say closure sounds like their school is going to be shut and there were concerns about operating over two sites.Mrs Robertson said that Helen Gillanders, headteacher of Dunbar Primary School, which operates over two sites, also attended meetings to discuss how her school operates.The merging of the two schools was supported by all four ward councillors at a meeting in Haddington.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader, said it was ldquothe most important decision we make\".He said: ldquoPupilsrsquo le chances are affected by their school experiences and both schools play a signicant role in this community.He acknowledged that

So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU. The only way end this agony and confusion is for Britain to accept that Brexit is just too costly, too dficult, too unpredictable and too all-consuming. The message would be: For Gods sake, lets just stop this madness and get our lives back."},{"url":null,"title":"Today   s feminist activists are wrong to exclude men","story":"Anne Widdicombe might have dismissed it as trivial and whingeing ndash and some #MeTooers undoubtedly deserve that label ndash but the culture of sexual harassment and abuse it calls out is far from unimportant. Equally crucial are other issues that have vexed women for decades,not centuries, among them equality of pay, professional respect and opportunity.So far, so reasonable. Yet, when I heard Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland, talking last week about Mothers of Invention, a podcast she has set up that focusses exclusively on womenrsquos efforts to address climate change, my heart did a double skip: one for delight, two for despair. Delight that women are getting involved directly in trying to help reduce our carbon footprint, without a doubt the most urgent of the worldrsquos ails, but despair at Robinsonrsquos smug assumption that ldquoitrsquos women who change behaviour, in the family and the community.Letrsquos put aside for a moment the fact that, as Robinson reveals in her recent book, Climate Justice, her own awareness of environmental calamity dawned on her like a Damascene conversion astonishingly late in the day. What sets my teeth on edge is the sanctimonious way in which women are increasingly frequently being portrayed ndash mostly by other women. Itrsquos asthere is a collective halo that needs constant polishing, lest it lose its lustre. Indeed, it seems you cannot these days be a female in a position of influence or authority without feeling the urge ndash or the pressure ndash to add a stone to the cairn of womenrsquos rights, entitlements and endeavours.Donrsquot misunderstand me. I am an old-style feminist, and decry utterly the unfair, oppressive and sometimes iniquitous treatment of women in our and other societies. Men have an awful lot to answer for, today and in the past. But I get decidedly uneasy at the perceptual ide that appears to be widening between the sexes. Climate change, said Robinson, is ldquoman-made, and she enjoys using the term, even though admitting it embraces men and women. But apart from this deliberate provocation, is she really correct in assuming that women change attitudes more widely than men Maybe it depends on what sort of country yoursquore living in. When I look around the UK, I donrsquot recognise that stark distinction. Plenty of men seem to be trying to bring about green change, ethical enlightenment, societal improvement, better childcare and education, and are working towards this alongside women. Sometimes, for heavenrsquos sake, they are even taking the lead.Meanwhile, children in two-parent families are open to influences from both parents. While women still tend to spend more time with their young, this does not necessarily equate to a more lasting influence on their behaviour or outlook. The other day my husbandrsquos granddaughter rushed to interrupt her mother who was on the phone to announce that Liverpool had just scored a fourth goal against Newcastle ndash whose influence was that We are going through a phase where almost every interview with a woman politician or banker, entrepreneur or artist, includes the obligatory question about #MeToo, in the same way that every American is asked their opinion of Trump. And while it obviously takes women at the top to help bring about change for those lower down the ladder ndash or in the community at large ndash it is surely not a sacred obligation placed upon each of them. To assume that is to be sexist and discriminatory. Itrsquos certainly not an expectation placed upon men.Yet to listen to some womenrsquos outrage, yoursquod think therersquos a contract, signed at birth, that insists women pay especial attention to female issues eventhere are things that interest them more. Florence Nightingale and Elsie Inglis personally helped save hundreds of lives, and their influence rippled down the decades to the benefit of all, women as much as men. Yet their initial impulse was not to improve things for their own kind, but to help wounded soldiers and the sick and dying. In other words, to improve the conditions of humanity as a whole, not one gender or the other.Of course splinter groups and special interest parties can make things change ndash just look at Dr Inglisrsquos formidable all-women hospitals. There is a galvanising power and collective spirit in female solidarity that nobody can deny. So letrsquos hear it for women tackling climate change. And for men too.In these unsettling and perilous times we surely need to remember that we are all just people. Our identity is not primarily male or female, trans, intersex, other, or whatever label fits. We are simply and essentially human, with all the complexities of personality, type, and biases that entails. Since wersquore in it all together, thatrsquos also how we should sort things out."},{"url":null,"title":"tv-review-luther-is-back-and-guess-who-knocked-on-his-door","story":"Doctor Who BBC ***A SUSPECT sprints into a dockyard, pursued by a Volvo driven by a demon lawman.

A clear majority of the pupils really enjoy taking part in all of the science activities listed. Doing experiments in class was the most enjoyed activityldquoP-P pupil beliefs regarding science were generally positive. There was a strong indication that many of the pupils were keen to be involved with science when they left school.ldquoHowever, there was little indication that they could see themselves as a scientist in the future, which may coincide with the relatively low levels of those who know someone who works in science.Researchers said a key strength of the new approach in Raise schools was the use of primary science development officersto help teachers expand on existing science education.These officers are supported by a national education officer for primary science, employed by The Wood Foundation, but seconded to national schools body Education Scotland.The Robert Owen Centre report concluded: ldquoThe evidence to date strongly indicates that the PSDOs are working effectively to promote Raise objectives and that the national education officer has had a critical role in ensuring the coherence of the overall approach and in supporting the development of the PSDOs.Sharon Smith, the PSDO for West Dunbartonshire Council, believes the Raise approach is having a signicant impact.She said the key to success was engaging with families as early as possible to ensure they had a positive attitude towards the study of science.ldquoWe have been holding science open evenings to get whole families to come to school and take part in experiments. We had families building model propeller boats and getting them to move across a water trough, she explained.ldquoI had a grandmother try out the experiment and she said she had always been rubbish at science at school, but was delighted she could do it and that is the key.ldquoBy involving the parents and the grandparents you are starting to re-write some of the mindsets they have from their own experiences of much more traditional science experiments.Mrs Smith said modern science lessons should be focused on investigation to allow pupils to come up with their own ideas for research and then back it up with experiments.ldquoIt is trying to build up the habits of trial and error in a group setting where they are working as a team and learning from mistakes. We find a lot more buzz about the lessons and much more of a focus on on investigating and being curious.Headteachers in West Dunbartonshire have welcomed the new approach. Karen Hollern, headteacher at Balloch Primary, said: ldquoThe programme has permeated our whole curriculum and our pupils have benefited hugely from being involved in it.ldquoThey have gained in confidence, engaged with teachers and have shown great enthusiasm for the ious dferent experiments and practical projects we have undertaken.A spokeswoman for The Wood Foundation said the creation of strong foundations for science in primary was critical to developing the workforce of the future.

Justine Greening refused to move from Education to Work and Pensions and so left Government, the first of several.Just to underline how reshuffles are iniably fraught affairs, the Prime Ministerrsquos decision to appoint Maria Caulfield as the new Conservative vice-chairwoman for women was hit by a tide of criticism from womenrsquos campaigners given the Sussex MP opposes the decriminalisation of abortion. Ironically, her tenure would last just six months. She resigned in July. Over Brexit. What  At the end of January a leaked government paper showed that Brexit would damage the UK economy no matter what kind of deal was agreed as much as eight per cent of GDP growth would go up in smoke within  years.In the spring, tensions mounted as the Lords inflicted a series of defeats on the Government on, among others, the customs union, removing the March  exit date and citizensrsquo rights they would later be overturned in the Commons. But the heat was rising.At the May elections in England, the Tories avoided a humiliating result, losing only  seats while Labour and the Liberal Democrats gained  and  respectively. Naturally, they talked up the results but in the past the Opposition have picked up hundreds of seats at the governing partyrsquos expense.By July the Tory psychodrama moved into a key act with a marathon Cabinet meeting at Chequers and the agreement on the way forward: Mrs Mayrsquos deal or no-deal.Yet, within  hours David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, would resign, followed by his Brexit department colleague Steve Baker. The plan for a free trade area was too much as it would bind the UK to EU rules this was not aof sovereignty, insisted the departing ministers, but vassalage.Then  hours later Boris Johnson resigned as Foreign Secretary, denouncing how the Brexit ldquodream is dying. Within another  hours Ms Caulfield and Ben Bradley had resigned their Tory Party positions as vice-chairmen.But the resignations stopped there the Tory avalanche did not happen even though the damage was bad enough. Two of the original Brexiteers, Gove and Fox remainedAs the UKrsquos long hot summer rolled on, relief was at hand.Donald Trump finally turned up on British shores to give the Brexit soap opera a bit of American pizzazz not that it needed it. The US President demanded tea with the Queen and teed off at Turnberry. In between, there was the little matter of a meeting with Mrs May at Chequers ndash where  The US Presidentrsquos guile as a businessman meant he sought to disorientate his host even before the summit had begun with an interview with the Brexit-friendly Sun in which he damned the PMrsquos Withdrawal Plan, saying it would \"probably kill\" any trade deal with America.He then sought to brand the interview ldquofake news even though what he was complaining about was all on tape. Which gave us an insight into how Mr Trump handles the Press.It also emerged The Donald had given The Theresa a bit of helpful advice: sue the EU.Just before the summer recess the PMrsquos Chequers Plan was formally declared dead as the Government accepted changes to its plan on trade by Jacob Rees-Moggrsquos European Research Group. No  insisted the changes were consistent with Mrs Mayrsquos proposal but it looked like many to a cave-in to keep the hard right-wingers on board.The Government began its tranche of technical notices on what would happenthere were a no-deal, including sending in the Army to deliver food, medicine and fuel supplies. Supermarkets were also beginning to stockpile.There have, of course, been the occasional distractions from the runaway train that is Brexit some offering genuine relief to the Tories and others just piling on the pressure.They included the plunge in UK-Russia relations over the attempted poisoning of the Skripals using a military grade nerve agent and the subsequent murder of Dawn Sturgess the Windrush scandal that cost Amber Rudd her job as Home Secretary the purported ldquoend of austerity with pay rises for public sector workers official approval of the third runway at Heathrow and the football World Cup.Then, of course, there was Ruth Davidson and her uplting announcement that she was pregnant Finn duly arrived in October, meaning that during the ongoing psychodrama at least one senior Tory was back stage, tending to other, more important matters.As the conference season got underway, Brussels delivered its own rebuff to Mrs May, rejecting her Chequers Plan. By the time it came to her keynote conference speech even twinkle-toes Theresa could not bear to mention the phrase by name.As October progressed, the Tory leader was looking for a way out of the seemingly intractable backstop issue and suggested perhaps extending the transition period.Despite her assurances, particularly to the Scottish Conservatives, that Britain would become an independent coastal state by the end of the transition period in December , she conspicuously failed to say what would happenthis were extended. The assumption, certainly in Brussels, was thatthe transition period were extended, then so too would the UKrsquos alignment with the hated EU Common Fisheries Policy. Scottish Secretary David Mundell wrote to the PM, making clear that reneging on commitments to Scotlandrsquos fishermen would be a resigning matter.As autumn progressed pressure was beginning to build from all sides.In late October, some , people marched in London in support of a Peoplersquos Vote anathema to Mrs May.The Confederation of British Industry reported  per cent of UK firms had cancelled or delayed investments due to Brexit uncertainty double the figure from a year earlier.Mid-November saw another landmark Cabinet meeting when, we were told, senior ministers backed the PM and her plan following a ldquolong, detailed and impassioned debate\".But as with Chequers beforehand, the aftermath saw the resignation of another Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab. His Cabinet colleague Esther McVey bailed out too as did two junior ministers.Crucially, the others on resignation-watch did not follow suit most notably Michael Gove, who stayed on as Environment Secretary to fight to change the deal in the mid to long term. If he had gone, then the Scot might have sparked the departure of others and brought Mrs May down.At yet another EU summit, the EU agreed the PMrsquos Plan, the ldquobest and only deal possible.Tensions mounted in SW as the anti-EU Tory European Research Group boasted the  signatures needed to mount a no-confidence vote were in but then had to back down. Their day would come though.By now the pyschodrama was entering the beginning of its most crucial act at Westminster.After yet another ministerial resignation, Sam Gyimahrsquos - the th - the Government was found in contempt of Parliament for failing to publish in full the Attorney Generalrsquos legal advice. MPs also voted for the amendment tabled by former Tory Cabinet Minister Dominic Grieve to give Parliament control should Mrs Mayrsquos Plan be rejected.The next day, the Government published the legal advice, revealing the backstop could ldquoendure indefinitelyno agreement was reached.The following week saw the most dramatic -hour period in the psychodrama to date.On the day the European Court of Justice ruled Britain could cancel Article  without the consent of the EU, the PM called an emergency Cabinet meeting and announced the postponement of the vote on her deal, knowing she was facing a humiliating defeat.The next day, Mrs May was in Brussels trying to improve the deal, most notably on the backstop, but without joy. At Westminster, MPs debated her decision to pull the vote. Some ministers began to air alternatives to the PMrsquos plan a sure sign she had lost control.Rumours that the  signatures to call a no-confidence vote in the Tory leader abounded and were confirmed the following morning by Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the  Committee. By that afternoon the vote was taken and the PM won the vote. Yet,  Conservative MPs said they had no confidence in her more than a third of the party. She battled on but her authority was badly dented.Jeremy Corbyn tabled a no-confidence vote. But it was not in the Tory Government as a whole, rather in Mrs Mayrsquos leadership alone. This meant, by parliamentary convention, the Government did not have to allow Commons time for a debate and a vote. Critics said it was nothing more than an empty gesture.And now as we gird our loins for the next intensive episode of what has become a national psychodrama, who knows how many more political casualties there will be. By the end of this month Mrs May could well be one of them."},{"url":null,"title":"disappointed-by-tv-version-of-les-mis-here-comes-the-real-thing","story":"ldquoThose pictures looked exactly like the set of Les Miserables, says the composer of one of the most iconic pieces of musical theatre in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.ldquoFirst of all it made me realise that Les Miserables is still relevant. Secondly, it also made me realise that in  years we have learnt nothing.Maybe this is why the current year-long UK tour of Les Miserables, originally adapted by Schonberg and writer Alan Boublil from Victor Hugorsquos  novel, has pretty much sold out already.Arriving in Edinburgh this month for the first time in  years for a month-long run, the English-language version of Boublil and Schonbergrsquos show has been a fixture of the London theatre circuit since Trevor Nunn directed a co-production between the Royal Shakespeare Company and Cameron Mackintosh at the Barbican in .This makes it the second longest-running musical in the world.Despite the success of putting Hugorsquos story charting ex-convict Jean Valjeanrsquos travails through poverty-stricken France onstage, Schonberg for one isnrsquot quite sure of the reasons why it happened.ldquoItrsquos a phenomenon I donrsquot really understand, the now -year old composer admits of a creation which introduced the world to songs now regarded as modern classics such as I Dreamed A Dream, ldquobut the show is more popular than ever. I must say, Irsquom totally surprised.By the time Les Miserables opens at the Festival Theatre in Edinburgh, the new six-part TV adaptation of Hugorsquos book scripted by Andrew Davies will be mid-way through its own run. With Dominic West playing Valjean as part of a cast that includes Olivia Coleman and David Oyelowo, rather than claiming kin with Boublil and Schonbergrsquos take on things, advance publicity appears to pointing up the fact that it is categorically not the musical, and shouldnrsquot be confused as such. Viewers and critics have already criticised this sans songs version as being flat.With Les Mis the musical itself filmed in  with Hugh Jackman as Valjean, this too is something Schonberg doesnrsquot understand.ldquoWhenever I read an article about the BBC version, they are saying it is the real version of the novel and not the trivial musical stage version, he says.ldquoI donrsquot know how you can promote something against it. People know the title because of the musical show, but each time therersquos an adaptation, they all make the point that they are not going to have anyone singing. But who knows  This one might be very good. I will look at it carefully.Schonberg probably doesnrsquot need to worry too much. As he points out, there has been more than  films based on Hugorsquos novel, with over  TV adaptations as well as another  dferent versions onstage. This is how great stories work as they are reimagined for every age. Indeed, it was another musical adaptation of a nineteenth century novel that was the starting point for Les Miserables.ldquoAlain saw Oliver! in London, says Schonberg, who had previously collaborated with Boublil on La Revolution Francaise, Francersquos first rock opera, produced in . ldquoI said to Alain, next time we find a big subject, we have it as a sung-through musical, and when Alain saw Oliver!, that gave us an idea about how to do it.Lionel Bartrsquos musical version of Charles Dickensrsquo novel, Oliver Twist, had already been adapted for film by Carol Reed in  by then, after being first seen on the West End eight years earlier. Prior to putting Les Miserables onstage, as was the fashion then, Boublil and Schonberg released a recording of it as a concept album. This approach had already paid idends for the English musical theatre team of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita, and Schonberg had already scored hit records in France.Three years after the Les Miserables concept album had led to the showrsquos original French production, it was heard by British producer Cameron Mackintosh after it was passed on to him by director Peter Farago.ldquoTwo years after the show closed in Paris, Cameron was organising his records and put it on, Schonberg recalls. ldquoand after that we heard he was looking for those crazy French guys, Schonberg and BoublilWhile the pair worked on new drafts of Les Miserables, Mackintosh was riding high on the success of Cats, directed by Trevor Nunn, who had also overseen David Edgarrsquos epic staging of Dickensrsquo Nicholas Nickleby, and knew how to put on a big show. Success was far from guaranteed, however, and the opening night of Les Mis was a critical disaster.ldquoThe critics were very bad,rsquo says Schonberg, actually using the v word eight times. ldquoCameron has a tradition of having a lunch the day after an opening night, and it was like a funeral. We thought it was finished, and during the lunch Cameron kept trying to call the box office to measure the scale of the disaster, but couldnrsquot get through. Eventually he received a message to say that the reason he couldnrsquot get through was that the show had sold , tickets, and in two weeks would be sold out.Les Miserables went on to win an Olivier Award for the most popular show, while on Broadway it won three Tony awards.The current touring version is directed by Laurence Connor and James Powell for a production reinvigorated for the showrsquos th anniversary in . The result is a very st century Les Mis, which utilises projections based on paintings by Hugo created by son et lumiere auteurs Fty-Nine Productions. The internationally renowned team led by Leo Warner and Mark Grimmer, who have come a long way since their early work at the Traverse Theatre, the National Theatre of Scotland and with Stellar Quines Theatre Company.Having worked worldwide on the National Theatrersquos production of War Horse and the  Olympics, more recently  have been responsible for opening events of the Edinburgh International Festival, Deep Time, Bloom and the First World war-themed Five Telegrams. The latter projected images onto the walls of the Usher Hall accompanied by a thundering score by Anna Meredith.ldquoThere have been so many improvements to Les Miserable this year,rsquo says Schonberg. ldquoThat has a lot to do with technological developments which wouldnrsquot have been possible even five years ago.This keeps the show fresh for several generations of theatre-goers, as was proven last week, when Schonberg met a woman who told him how shersquod seen Les Miserables a staggering  times.ldquoFor Christmas she was taking her children and grand-children to see the show with hr again,rsquo he says.What Les Miserables taps into, again, Schonberg isnrsquot sure about. All he can say is that ldquoI think we did the right job, but it is the novel that is responsible for the success of the show, and for whatever reason, people seem to leave the theatre a bit dferent. People are scared for the future. Theyrsquore all looking for a bright tomorrow and waiting for the sun to shine, and people come out of the show perhaps believing they can be a better person.Les Miserables, Festival Theatre, Edinburgh, January -February .www.capitaltheatreswww.lesmis"},{"url":null,"title":"impact-of-brexit-on-scotlands-construction-sector-to-be-examined-by-holyrood","story":"The inquiry will also consider the effect technological changes and automation will have on the industry - which employs more than , people, % of the Scottish workforce.The work is to be carried out by the Economy, Energy and Fair Work Committee, with convener Gordon Lindhurst saying MSPs are keen to discover how challenges facing the building industry can be overcome.:Scottish construction firms fear Brexit will hike labour costsHe said: \"Construction is a vital sector in Scotland as it drives and underpins the economy with its knock-on effect on other sectors.\"As well as being a major employer, the sector also delivers infrastructure for housing, transport, education and community, and contributes pound. billion to Scotlands gross domestic product.\"However, the sector has its challenges and we want to hear views and suggestions on how these can be overcome.

This can then provide a story of value or a source of income for organised crime players.ldquoYou could always tell the sort of companies associated with organised crime. Taxi, security and logistics firms, tanning salon and nail bars.ldquoWe are beginning to move away from that now. What we are seeing is that for the serious players in organised crime and looking to acquire business with a good track record, training and good reputation in marketplace.ldquoThe typical scenario is they identity a company which has all of these characteristics but for whatever reason has run in to cash flow dficulties.ldquoIn general, the central belt of Scotland has always been resilient to outside influences. Increasingly the senior players in Scottish organised are engaging with international service providers.One of those foreign iniduals has himself acquired a business in exactly the way I have described.ldquoI think that could be as a result of wishing to de-risk from being directly involved in the physical carriage of drugs.Scotland has increasingly become known overseas as the new Switzerland - with its shell companies offering the same kind of opportunities to hide illicit cash as Swiss bank accounts once did.Mr Murray, however, is not talking about shell companies, such as Scottish limited partnerships, which tend to bank overseas. He is talking about the purchase by gangsters of real-world business which employ real people and do real business in Scotland.And he believes the consequences for failing to deal with this criminalisation could be grave. Mr Murray said: ldquoThe fundamental penalty for allowing an accumulation of criminal cash in the economy is that it is a drag on the economy. It undermines competitiveness, it discourages legitimate players from entering those markets. If it becomes a growing theme in Scotland, it is bound to affect inward investment. I think it is a serious issue."},{"url":null,"title":"majority-of-tory-members-want-theresa-mays-plan-ditched-for-no-deal-brexit-says-poll","story":"As the Prime Minister enters the most crucial period of her premiership with the crunch Commons vote on the proposed UK-EU deal due in less than two weeksrsquo time, some  per cent of the Tory rank and file say they are convinced that leaving the EU without a deal is better than their own leaders Brexit Plan, according to a poll funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.Less than a quarter,  per cent, would vote for Theresa Mays deal in a three-way referendum between the deal, no-deal and remaining in the EU.Professor Tim Bale, who lead the research, said the latest findings were bad news for the PMrsquos hopes of winning support for her deal.\"If Theresa May is hoping that her MPs willto Westminster having been persuaded by their constituency associations to back her Brexit deal, shes going to be disappointed.

nightmare","story":"Former RAF pilot Don Mason, who lives in Thurso, has been awarded the British Empire Medal in the New Year honours list in recognition of his services to the community in Caithness. He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.ldquoWe had been in No.  Group Bomber Command, says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. ldquoThe whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. ldquoWe had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogetherhellip It required a lot of dferent techniques.ldquoAnd it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore yoursquod got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.ldquoThere developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.ldquoOn one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnrsquot just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.ldquoObviously we knew something was happening, Don says, ldquobecause we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werenrsquot aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. ldquoBefore that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: ldquoOne thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Donrsquos chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as ldquoPiccadilly Circus ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.ldquoWe were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place, he explains. ldquoIt was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. ldquoThey all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. ldquoHe released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one, says Don.ldquoThere was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnrsquot a great deal of resistance.It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crewmates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: ldquoThe Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.ldquoYou couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnrsquot want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  ldquoWell, everybodyrsquos scared ndash I donrsquot care what anyone says, he replies. ldquoIf yoursquore not scared you donrsquot perform, but itrsquos discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .ldquoThis is rude, I know, but itrsquos what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Itrsquos a matter of accepting whatrsquos going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job yoursquore supposed to do.ldquoItrsquos not a question of bravery. Irsquom very suspicious when people say, lsquoOh, yoursquore a brave man,rsquo or lsquoYouve got a lot of courage.rsquo You react to circumstances. Itrsquos a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.ldquoAnd I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when yoursquove got a unorm on and yoursquore acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.ldquoSo Irsquom very suspicious about lsquobraveryrsquo. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I donrsquot think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I donrsquot know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.DON can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.ldquoI fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhamrsquos Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating, Don says. ldquoHe had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a manrsquos wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.ldquoBut the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thatrsquos what I did.He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash ldquoI went to Arnhem five times during that debacle, says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until rsquo.He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crewmates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.ldquoAlthough our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand, says Don. ldquoIn  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnrsquot got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hersquod said, lsquoIrsquod love to see my old mate again.rsquo So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.ldquoNow you canrsquot explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Itrsquos what they call camaraderie. Irsquom still in touch with his family.As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash ldquotherersquos no doubt about that. But he adds: ldquoI regret to say I donrsquot think wersquove learned any lessons. I donrsquot think we should be doing what wersquore doing now [in Iraq].ldquoAs I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Itrsquos not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action.

Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

Whilst I have slightly warmed to the idea, I still have some concerns, he said.Councillor Sinclair thinks the vast majority of vehicles are already driving at around mph through Wick anyway.He wonders how effectively the new speed limits will be implemented with all the current pressures and priorities of the police.The scheme is being rolled out across the region with restrictions implemented for Alness, Dingwall, Invergordon and Tain. Gateway signage, roundels, mph repeater signs and speed indication devices have been introduced in all four Ross-shire towns.Some local residents commenting on social media felt it would be hard to police the speed restriction effectively.Wick man Konrad Szewczyk said: ldquoSuch nannying should be relegated to nurseries and primary schools, not entire settlements.\"A Bridge Street shopkeeper, Kevin Milkins, thought there was \"little use having laws with no-one to enforce them\", referring to a lack of policing.While one local woman who did not wish to be named said: \"They can set whatever speed limits they want but the idiots and young racers will decide their own speed.\"A council spokesperson said thatthe scheme goes through the consultation process with no objections it could be in place by March.Friday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118636.jpg","title":"New chief is told of local issues","story":"BUDGET cuts and decentralisation were the main topics raised by Caithness people when the new Highland Council chief executive, Donna Manson, visited Wick and Thurso.She met staff, councillors and members of the public as she listened to their concerns and issues.

More information is given on the Scottish Government#s website, here.Publishing the payment schedule, rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing said: “As we approach the commencement of the New Year, I want to provide farmers, crofters and other rural businesses with as much clarity and certainty as possible.“I am therefore confirming that we intend to keep to the proposed CAP payment timetable published in our stabilisation plan, which outlines when farmers and crofters can expect to receive their CAP entitlements.“By doing this, we are offering clarity and certainty over when payments will be made, demonstrating stability in our payment system, while enabling farmers and crofters the opportunity to plan ahead accordingly.”The president of the Scottish farmers union, NFU Scotland, Andrew McCornick said the timetable will be valued by farmers and crofters, particularly following a tough year for agriculture in Scotland.Mr McCornick: “Confirmation that balance payments for Pillar  schemes will start in March, and payments for coupled support and LFASS starting a month later, will allow many businesses to now plan their cash flows on that basis.#Many farmers are extremely reliant on these scheme payments and their timing so the payment calendar will allow farmers and crofters to carefully plan for the year ahead. Any delay in the timetable with an important scheme like LFASS, would merit Scottish Government considering another loan scheme as a contingency, as it has previously.“Successive loan schemes have been invaluable in addressing cash flow concerns but the continued need for loan schemes demonstrates that confidence in the SGRPID system to deliver prompt payments in the future is still an issue.

The final cost is expected to rise by another £.bn over budget.The National Audit Office has put the total cost of running and updating the UK’s nuclear deterrent at over £bn, and last year said it would be “crucial” to find ways of cutting the bill to make it affordable.Defence secretary Gavin Williamson argued for extra money in last year’s budget, but was given just £bn to fill the gaps.Cost pressures have forced a two-year delay to construction of the Astute-class of nuclear-powered attack submarines.Trevor Taylor, a naval specialist at military think-tank the Royal United Services Institute, told the Financial Times that “nuclear subs are the most demanding defence project”. “You do not get to build a prototype – you have to get it right first time.”Mr Taylor said: “Can Dreadnought sink the defence budget  The answer is yes.”He added: “At what point does an independent British deterrent become unaffordable  For me, there is such a commitment to this that they would spend whatever was needed.”Richard Scott, naval consultant editor at defence journal Jane’s, said MoD officials were privately voicing their own fears about the costs of replacing Trident.“You hear comments about the disproportionate impact the deterrent has on the overall defence budget,” Mr Scott said. “Some people are asking, ‘can we really justy this’ ”In March, the MoD was allowed to use £m of a £bn contingency fund held by the Treasury to ensure the Dreadnought programme, being delivered by BAE Systems at Barrow-in-Furness, remained on track.Announcing the funding, Prime Minister Theresa May said it was “another sign of the deep commitment this Government has to keeping our country safe”.Defence contractor BAE has described the programme as “one of the world’s most complex engineering challenges”.Dreadnought submarines, which like their predecessors will be based at Faslane naval base on the west coast of Scotland, will be powered by a new model of nuclear reactor that will not be able to be tested in prototype, posing the biggest risk to the project, according to analysts.SNP MSP Bill Kidd said the cost of the Trident renewal programme was “enormous and unjustiable”. He claimed an independent Scotland would be able to avoid “paying through the nose for these wasteful and immoral weapons”.“It is increasingly obvious that the UK Government’s single-minded obsession with nuclear weapons is going to come at a huge cost to our conventional defence,” Mr Kidd said.“The staggering revelation that even senior military officials are now questioning whether we can justy Trident renewal should give the Tories – and Labour – a reality check.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"vandalism incident takes place in sumburgh airport car park ","story":"Police are appealing for information after three cars had their windows smashed at Sumburgh Airport.Each of the vehicles, which were parked in the main car park, had their door windows smashed.The incident is believed to have happened between pm on Monday and am on Wednesday.Police are asking anyone with information to contact , or attend Lerwick Police Station..."},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland. We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27509  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinI remain optimistic because Ireland is changing.

The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland. was a milestone in a changing Ireland. It was given voice in the Repeal referendum. In Belfast the largest political demonstration was Pride. For this generation the border is an anachronism. When the Repeal result was read out a sign was held aloft, ‘The North is next’. Rights transcend borders and so does this generation. will mark the centenary of the First Dáil. A people’s parliament for a revolutionary generation. The coming year is an opportunity to rebuild that culture of change and a parliament that serves the people and not vested interests. Sinn Féin will stand with the people on the streets and stand up for them in the Dáil because the housing and health crises can and must be ended.The policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael created and sustained the health and housing crises. As waiting lists grow and the number of patients on trollies hit record highs, the Taoiseach points the finger of blame at doctors and nurses who take Christmas leave. His response to rising evictions and homelessness is to defend the Vulture Funds and give tax breaks to landlords.The Taoiseach and Fine Gael are supported in all of this by Mícheál Martin and the supply and confidence trick.Regardless of what choice the British government makes on Brexit, it cannot be allowed to damage Irish interests, our economy, our agreements or the rights of citizens. This is one issue that unites the majority of parties North and South. We will continue to stand up in the interest of all Ireland. Early in January I will travel to Brussels to continue our engagements with European leaders.An Executive in the North should be in place delivering for all in the community, growing the economy, standing up to destructive Tory policies, and representing the majority view on Brexit. Instead we have witnessed daily at an inquiry the corruption of governance that led to the RHI scandal.No government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP. All the while the Irish and British governments looked on and refused to act. It is a disgrace that the institutions of the north are not up and running.We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the Institutions. The DUP walked away. The two governments promised a new talks process. Ten months on there has been no talks and no process. There has been nothing constructive from the two governments. That is not good enough.Every day that the Executive is suspended undermines the political institutions. Every refusal to recognise rights undermines the political process. The threat to impose Brexit undermines the democratic process.The DUP know that their deal with the Tories will end. They also know that the refusal of rights is not compatible with equality and power-sharing government. They should also know that there is no good or positive Brexit for the north.Sinn Féin is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.The DUP knows what needs to be done. Theresa May knows what needs to be done. It will require leadership that has been absent to date.The two governments have indulged the DUP at the cost of the political process. The two governments know what must be done to form a new Executive in the north. The current do-nothing approach is running out of road.The majority of parties share a common approach to Brexit and to the rights of citizens, and are committed to working together to build a new Executive.The two governments must convene talks and make clear the agreements and rights of citizens will be at the core of a new Executive.The Irish Government cannot look on as spectators. They cannot stand idly by while the DUP and British government shred the agreements. The agreements are the people’s agreements. The people voted for them. The Taoiseach said that the people of the north will not be left behind again. The government must plan for a successful talks process and also have a backup plan.They must also begin preparations for Irish Unity. There is no contradiction in seeking the establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and fulfilling its promise of a unity referendum. The time is right to hold an informed and respectful conversation and referendum on our shared long term future as a united people and a united Ireland. No government should try and stle that debate or call for it to be suspended.I remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises.

offer in case of emergency card","story":"Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Policing and Community Safety Partnership , in partnership with local police is launching a new community safety initiative, in case of emergency card , to make sure people get the best treatment at a time when they need it most.Indicating who should be contacted in the event of an accident or emergency, the ICE Card also provides your medical information including any conditions or allergies you may have, medication you are taking and your blood type.An emergency can strike anywhere - you might be far from home, family or friends - and carrying the ICE Card means that your loved ones can be reached quickly and avoids the problem of unlocking mobile for emergency details.Stressing the importance of carrying an ICE Card, Chair of ABC PCSP, Councillor Joe Nelson commented: “This is a very simple yet effective initiative. Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups. For more information on how to get an ICE Card please contact PCSP Project Officer, Billy Stewart on    or by emailing william.stewart@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk.\"  \"  Police warn Northern Ireland residents to look out for vulnerable relatives after two people robbed of thousands Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8756119.1546445050!/image/image.jpg","title":"st colman s have a super tour","story":"Local families attending the Family Health Initiative at St Colman#s Primary School recently visited Moundview Eurospar in Dromore for a supermarket tour.The Family Health Initiative is a healthy lestyle programme delivered by Early Years- the organisation for young children in the Southern Trust and is funded by the Public Health Agency.During the supermarket tour both parents and children took part in a fantastic scavenger hunt to find all the healthy food items on their sheet.

Speaking to the North Belfast News, Neil Francis said: “Me and my friends were walking out of the playground and this baby walked down towards the pond. We saw a woman pointing towards the baby and he slipped into the water face first. “All the other people started panicking and they all ran over and people were screaming. I got on my stomach and tried to reach in to get him, but I couldn’t reach so I just jumped in lted him under the armpits and lted him out.“A woman took the baby and cleaned him and dried him. I was scared, but nobody  seemed to be doing anything so I just jumped in. I was worried that it might be a bit deep, but I was more worried about the baby. I’m just really happy that the baby wasn’t hurt.”Neil Francis has been recognised as hero at his school assembly, and was gted a superman t-shirt by his religion teacher Mr Wylie. Paul Berne, acting Principal at Edmund Rice College, said: “We’re delighted that these kids are able to do what they’re doing. It’s the second time our pupils have saved someone’s le in a month. We’re very, very proud of them. They are top class role models for the school. About a month ago a sixth year helped someone in a hit-and-run and now we have this.It’s great that young people that age are able to do that – it’s incredible. Some people would freeze in these situations. These kids are top class. It’s a very tough thing and a very brave and courageous thing for any child to do.”Neil Francis’ mum, Natalie, added: “We’re so proud of him. We were scared that he did it, but we’re very happy that he did.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-28-at-13.57.45-copy-2.png","title":"when america bombed its own citizens","story":"FEW of us could point out Puerto Rico on a map of the world but fewer still are aware that this tiny Caribbean island, now a US territory, once boasted an independence movement which collaborated with De Valera. That gap in our knowledge has now been put right with the the timely publication of the powerful ‘War Against All Puerto Ricans: Revolution and Terror in America’s Colony’ by accomplished journalist Nelson A. Denis. His book sweeps through the many humiliations heaped on Puerto Ricans after the US invasion of , such as a ban on Spanish in schools and a prohibition against the flying of the nation’s flag. Where the American government led, business followed. Suffocating poverty on the island and slave-like conditions on the sugar plantations worsened. The first civilian governor Charles Allen ed to the US and leveraged his contacts and influence to become the King of Sugar. “By ,” writes Denis, “Allen and US banking interests had converted  per cent of all arable land in Puerto Rico into sugar plantations. These bank syndicates also owned the insular postal system, the entire coastal railroad, and the international seaport of San Juan.”Patriots responded with their own Nationalist Party but its ranks were riddled with FBI informers and when that didn’t stymie its growth, supporters were massacred in the town of Ponce. On Sunday March  , a parade of unarmed nationalist cadets was effectively ambushed by police in scenes similar to our own Bloody Sunday. “The police kept shooting and clubbing for thirteen minutes,” says Denis. “By the time they finished,  men, one woman and a seven-year-old girl lay dead over  more were gravely wounded — moaning, crawling, bleeding, and begging for mercy in the street.# marked the high-point of this revolutionary rising when, following  years of military occupation, the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico staged an unsuccessful armed insurrection.They paid a heavy price for tweaking the tale of the tiger. Ill-trained and poorly-equipped cadres of nationalists – branded communists by the powers-that-be – were cut down by US National Guard troops. In the town of Jayuya where revolutionaries had seized control, the residents were subjected to a merciless bombardment by ten Thunderbolt fighter planes armed with -lb bombs. It was the only time in history that the United States bombed its own citizens.Within a fortnight, the rebellion had been quashed but not before a failed assassination attempt on President Truman had ensured the tiny island nation’s freedom struggle made headlines around the world. The nationalists paid a heavy price: vengeful prison sentences were meted out to the leaders and activists. One woman, Blanca Canales, served  years of a le sentence for burning the post office in Jayuya — the same town levelled by US planes. Their incarcerated leader Pedro Albizu Campos was subject to brutal conditions right out of the Gulag Archipelago — and then some. In , he was exposed to radiation poisoning which led to visible burns on his extremities, swelling of his face and led to a stroke which left him paralysed. Thus ended the long struggle of the revolutionary who had parlayed with De Valera and raised money for the Irish liberation movement in Boston in  — at one point he spoke in front of , people in Sanders Theatre in Boston and delivered what was described, by an English lord no less who was present, as “the most complete, the most brilliant speech” on Irish freedom ever heard. The  years which followed his death in  were, says Denis, “a downward spiral of chaos and corruption that turned the island into a punch-drunk fighter, unsure of its whereabouts, wobbling on its feet, pawing at empty air”.It’s hard to argue that things have improved of late. Emigration is the only route to meaningful work for an entire generation: In  alone, it lost a net , residents or nearly . per cent of its population. In , the island went bankrupt with the US Government refusing to come to its aid. In , Puerto Rico was hammered by a Hurricane Maria — the worst natural disaster to ever hit the island. “Is there a solution to all this ” asks Denis. “Of course, but the complicated ones rarely work. Those that have been tried include corporate tax subsidies to giant pharmaceutical companies, a fraudulent war on drugs, government subsidies, austerity programmes, and real estate speculation. These ‘solutions’ breed government fraud, police corruption, absentee ownership, junk bonds, media spin, and rampant hotels, shopping malls and parking lots. The answer may be much simpler. It starts with an honest self-appraisal. It acknowledges the eviction of an entire people — literally and systematically — from their own land.”Nelson Denis has done a service to the people of Puerto Rico — his people — and to the wider world watching on with this authoritative history of a brave island people. He has, at last, put Puerto Rico on the map."},{"url":null,"title":"meet the brexitbashing twitter account followed by leo varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Editors Viewpoint: State papers show leaders saw a bigger picture The diplomat said many MPs who did not take an active interest in Irish affairs became \"puffed with outrage and conviction\" about doing something in response to the killings.He said suggestions ranged from demands for a tougher and revised policy of policing funerals to a demand for internment throughout Ireland and, in \"more cases than previously\", to a demand to setting a date for withdrawal from Ireland \"in order to let the Irish get on with butchering each other\". State papers: Clintons invite to Adams provoked furious response from PM Majors private secretary Mr Ryan also said people across Britain wrote to their MPs demanding greater action against terrorists.The two plain-clothed British soldiers inadvertently drove into the path of the funeral before mourners pulled them from the car and were beaten before being shot dead by members of the IRA.The murders happened days after the funerals of the three IRA members who were shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar. State papers: Taoiseach backs Garda in face of Iron Lady Margaret Thatchers disdain Mr Ryan said after meeting backbenchers at Westminster, he was struck by their exasperation and anger \"without any proper sense of how to ventilate it\" while there was a resurgence of \"frustrated patience\" with Ireland.\"The complexity of the issues elude their instinctual approach to policy questions, that of self-interested pragmatism and this further fuels their primary response to events such as last Saturdays,\" he added. State papers: Thatcher warned Haughey of worst civil war everUK allowed Irish unity \"It has to be said that no amount of violence toward the UDR, the RUC and Northern Irish or Irish civilians of any religious persuasion could come anywhere near provoking the same reaction in Britain to Saturdays killings - and the sort of killings they were - of their own English soldiers.\"He later said there was a risk the Anglo-Irish relationship and the Agreement may be \"caught in the net\" when MPs look for the reasons behind the murders.Days after the killings, the Secretary of State Tom King, made a speech to the House of Commons in which he described the \"horric events\" that shocked the world. State papers: Thatcher asked to make gesture of clemency in Guildford Four case  In a separate memo from Mr Ryan following a meeting with Conservative MP Edward Leigh, he said the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was left \"very distressed and very angry\" by the soldiers murders.Mr Leigh indicated that MPs held special meetings to call for support for \"much tougher and direct action\" by the SAS and other special units against terrorists.\"He stressed several times that he was not exaggerating the mood generally\", Mr Ryan wrote.Mr King told Mr Leigh during a meeting they had reason to believe the IRA was \"planning a serious offensive\", however he did not elaborate further than this."},{"url":null,"title":"bournemouth and watfords sixgoal first half stunned fans on social media","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Receiving the MBE is just totally surreal.ldquoIrsquom overwhelmed the work I do in safeguarding children and women has been recognised by the Queen.Sheila started to work as a front line practitioner in the field of social work  years ago. Today, she is Social Work Manager for the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust.She is also the chairperson of the South Eastern Area Domestic and Sexual Violence Abuse Partnership, a multi-disciplinary and inter-agency made up of voluntary and statutory community groups like Sure Start, Womenrsquos Aid and PSNI.Sheila said social workers were used to being on the receiving end of unwarranted bad publicity, but were expected by society to protect vulnerable children.She said: ldquoI first began to understand domestic violence when I became a social worker. I quickly realised it was prevalent in a lot of families.ldquoThankfully, society is beginning to talk about it more. ldquoWe need to continue to talk about it because it is so dficult for anyone living with domestic violence to tell their story and it is extremely dficult for children.ldquoThey are scared to speak out because they remain afraid of what might happen to themthey told an outside organisation. Sometimes, their silence is due to them feeling ashamed or even responsible for the abuse they are dealing with.Sheila understood quite early in le about the effects of trauma. Her elder brother, Eugene, disappeared on New Yearrsquos Day  when Sheila was in her early teens.His three children came to live with her family and she saw how her own mother and father were able to make their lives as normal as possible which led to some healing for all of them.The tragedy was the inspiration behind a play called, The Ferryman which debuted in London recently.ldquoMy role is tough, she explains, ldquobut social workers are our own support network. We meet with a lot of anger and abuse. It can be challenging but it can also be rewarding. Many people do come back to us to say thank you or, they will say to us that wersquove helped to turn their le around. That is said to us more frequently than anything . Thatrsquos what keeps us doing the job. We are the source from which change is possible. Everyone has the potential to change and I see it played out time and time again.It is evident that Sheila is dedicated to the families she protects. She said: ldquoDomestic violence is quite prevalent in Northern Ireland. One in six women and one in nine men will live with it including their children some time in their le.ldquoPolice are called to an incident every  minutes. Curiously, it is this time of year that sees a spike in those figures. Christmas Day and New Yearrsquos Day will see the highest numbers of women and children call the police for help.ldquoAnd, I do think the timing of this MBE from the Queen will only serve to raise awareness of this issue. And might even help someone who is suffering abuse to pick up the phone and ask for help.Sheila advises that anyone who wishes to make a call should contact   , which is completely confidential.

They include the Voisinage Agreement with the Irish Government to allow Co Down fishermen to resume fishing in Irish Sea waters. There is also the need for improvements to harbour infrastructure at Ardglass and Kilkeel to allow larger boats to land fish.Miss Ritchie said the prawn quota reduction was more to do with the species being exempted from so-called discard ban.She added: ldquoIt is vitally important that our local fishing industry in the catching and processing sectors is allowed to continue to grow and develop.ldquoThe Government needs to continue with a positive working relationship with the industry to allow the economic sectors in Ardglass and Kilkeel to be nurtured to ensure existing jobs are sustained and new employment opportunities are realised.Mr Alan McCulla, chief executive of the Anglo-North Irish Fish Producers Organisation Sea Source, believes the outcome of the annual negotiation on catch quotas ldquoputs Northern Irelandrsquos fishermen in a good starting position for the next phase in our relationship with the EU.He said the agreements reached at the Fisheries Council meeting offered ldquosome positives and some negatives for the Irish Sea, with the December negotiations described by the Department of Agriculture Environment and Rural Affairsas ldquoone of the most dficult councils in recent years.A spokesperson for the government department said it was vitally important to ensure that sufficient quota was obtained for all Irish Sea fish species to enable them to land all the fish they catch from the start of the New Year, particularly whiting which is a by-catch in the prawn fishery.ldquoThe EU Commission initially proposed an Irish Sea whiting quota of  tonnes but this was successfully negotiated up by % to  tonnes, with agreement to carry out a further review of the quota in the new year.The government department spokesperson said the deal ldquoensures that there are now workable solutions to alleviate the pressure for fishermen while preventing fish from being wastefully discarded unnecessarily..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan tree voted top in NI  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest Parkrsquos giant redwood is celebrating being voted Northern Irelandrsquos Tree of the Year in the Woodland Trustrsquos search for the countryrsquos best-loved tree.The stunning redwood mdash or multi-stemmed giant sequoia to be precise mdash finished second in the  UK final.Everyone associated with the Forest Service, the people of Castlewellan and ious groups helping with ambitious regeneration proposals at the stunning forest park, are delighted with the majestic treersquos success in the regional heat.The giant redwood stands within the walled garden at the forest park and at over  years old has seen centuries come and go.

The Hoops raced into a - first half lead with goals from Stephen Galbraithand Sean McMahon before Jordan McCoubrey delivered the coup de grace in the th minute to finally kill off a game Olympic outfit.Celtic looked the more composed and inventive side from the off and an understrength Olympic struggled to create anything of note. The Hoops seized the lead with only six and a half minutes gone and never looked back.Chris Mullan, who was like a fleet-footed gazelle down the left flank and just missed out on the man of the match award, sped past his marker on the edge of the box.His stinging shot that looked destined for the bottom corner of the net was parried out by an alert Ryan Connollly, but Galbraith was hovering around the six-yard box and was perfectly placed to steer the ball home.Less than two minutes later Mullan dipped his shoulder again and cut inside Jack Roddy before striking the base of the post with a fierce shot.Olympic steadfastly refused to buckle and with  minutes gone were unlucky not to equalise when Aaron McCaffrey, their most potent player in attack, was unable to take advantage in a rare moment of panic in the Celtic box.Celtic went back on the attack and with  minutes gone taskmaster Jordan Curran teamed up with Mullan to create an opening for Sean McMahon, but he fired wide.Back at the other end, the dangerous McCaffrey got in behind Conor Doherty, but his delightfully flighted cross missed by everyone in the box.With  minutes gone Rottweiler Curran blocked an Olympic attempt to send Rhys Patterson clear. The ball flew off his shin and into the path of the willing Sean McMahon who raced away from Michael Rice and Darryl Russell, but with only Connolly to beat, his cheeky, dinked effort grazed the crossbar on the way to safety.A minute later another mazy Mullan run ended with the wing wizard crossing for McMahon, but this seasonrsquos top scorer had his audacious effort blocked on the six yard box with Celtic claiming a penalty.The second goal wasnrsquot long in coming and with  minutes gone a Mullan cross was deftly headed home by Doherty, who had been given the freedom of the box. Three minutes later Galbraith made it - when his low corner evaded Connolly at his near post and ended up in the net.Celtic continued their dominance after the break with Mullan and McMahon dovetailing perfectly for Curran, but his shot went well over the top. With  minutes gone McMahon decided to go it alone, but he was well off target as Olympic backed off him.Olympic tried desperately to get things moving, but it just wasnrsquot their day and with  minutes played Russell did exceptionally well to prevent Galbraith from making it - with a last-gasp tackle.The fourth goal was just around the corner and with  minutes gone Andy Baggley headed the ball into the path of prodigy Jordan McCoubrey, who looked suspiciously offside. The teenage terrier didnrsquot hang around as Olympic had pushed up and he raced cleat to beat Connolly all ends up.If anything, Celtic could have won by an even bigger margin and Connolly saved brilliantly in the th minute to deny Baggley a fth Celtic goal.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Shaun Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Mikey Rice, Jordan Curran, Terence Bell, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan.

Mr Turner said that the CAJ “describe themselves as ‘an independent civil liberties organisation formed in  to work for the highest standards in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland’”.He said that the group had in recent years produced reports about inquests, complaints, the use of force by the security forces and emergency legislation.The restricted February   memo went on to say that CAJ had “increasingly used ‘international force’ in an attempt to bring pressure to bear on the Government’”.He said that “the RUC’sdescription of CAJ is that of a ‘self-appointed body of no official standing’”.Mr Turner said that “CAJ claim to have a membership drawn from both sections of the community ‘including lawyers, students, community workers, trade unionists, unemployed people and academics’.“In reality they are [a] left of centre group with mainly nationalist support . Other executive members have dfering shades of opinion ranging from the fairly sensible to the biased and naive.”He said that the CAJ “remain firmly opposed to the use of violence to achieve political goals although there has been a sht in the leadership to a face less acceptable to the NIO.“The author of CAJ’s monthly bulletinis strongly biased and opinionated today’s CAJ is not in the Brice Dickson mould.Sammy Wilson: Theresa May’s Brexit deal is only threat to Union Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“CAJ continue to produce distorted reports that fail to paint the whole picture.“However, they remain a ‘fashionably radical’ rather than in any way sinister grouping.”A note at the top of the memo beside the name Ms Johnston, said: “A regular ‘irritant’, the CAJ is wholly disliked by the RUC, but tolerated in other quarters. They have an unfortunate disregard of matters factual.”Among many senior civil servants to whom the note was copied was Stephen Rickard, an MI officer working within the NIO who just a few months later would be killed along with  other people when the Chinook helicopter on which he was travelling crashed on the Mull of Kintyre.Three days later, the private secretary to NIO security minister Sir John Wheeler wrote: “The minister was very grateful for your submission of  February which provided advice on the membership, and an assessment of the standing, of CAJ.“Sir John has noted the submission with understanding and amusement.”The file also contains a rare note from Northern Ireland’s most senior military officer, General Officer Commanding Sir Roger Wheeler, in which he suggested to the NIO’s permanent secretary that there should be a coordinated civil service, RUC and Army response to critical CAJ and Amnesty International reports.Sir Roger said that a recent report by the CAJ had been met with a rebuttal which was jointly drafted by Stormont’s top press officer, Andy Wood, the RUC’s chief press officer, Bill McGookin, and the Army’s chief information officer in Northern Ireland, Nigel Gillies.Sir Roger welcomed the fact that in response to an Amnesty international report which was critical of the security forces the secretary of state had written back to the group “challenging Amnesty to call on the paramilitaries to stop killing the security forces”.Last night Professor McEvoy, who is no longer on CAJ’s board, said: “The NIO assessment that CAJ was and is unequivocally opposed to political violence is of course correct.“As for the other suggestions, from memory, at the time we were working on issues such as reforming the police complaints system, public order policing and the role of human rights in the emerging peace process. “Much of that work was subsequently reflected in the Patten report and Good Friday Agreement. CAJ’s line remained consistent it was the NIO that changed.”try catch            ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

However, I do prefer to buy and shop from local family businesses.And for all those curious about Veganuary, are taking part for the first time or are interested in finding out more, Ms Thomas will be holding a VeganJanuary fair in Penarthrsquos Paget Rooms on Sunday, January  from pm to pm.There will be a iety of stalls including Melrsquos Kindness Kitchen Vegan Cheeses, Lottiersquos Vegan Bakery and more.For more information, search Absolutely Fabulous Vegan Fayres on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We need more people to change their lestyle and to take more exercise.ldquoPeople can feel less safe when they walk or cycle compared with when they drive. Wersquove got to change this.ldquoSo asking planners to prioritise pedestrians, cyclists and those who use public transport when roads are built or upgraded can ensure they are safe, attractive and designed to encourage people to get out from behind their wheel.Obesity is estimated to affect one in four adults and one in every five children aged  to .Physical inactivity is responsible for one in six deaths and is believed to cost the UK pound. billion each year, including pound million to the NHS.Joe Irvin, chief executive of everyday walking charity Living Streets, said: ldquoFor decades our towns and cities have been built to prioritise motor vehicles, resulting in unhealthy air, congested roads and a decline in people walking everyday journeys.ldquoThe better planning that Nice is suggesting is absolutely necessary. Those who are the most vulnerable ndash children and older people ndash are currently suffering the most from bad air, unhealthy lestyles and social isolation.ldquoItrsquos time that towns and cities were built for everyone ndash first and foremost for those on foot. Placing key services like schools, GP surgeries and bus stops within walking distance is vital.ldquoMore people getting out and walking everyday journeys, such as to work or school, will make us a healthier country.A public consultation on the draft guidelines from Nice will run until February .A Department for Transportspokeswoman said: ldquoDfT guidance is crystal clear that street design should explicitly consider pedestrians and cyclists first.ldquoOur Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy safety review, published last year, set out further measures to improve safety, including a review of the Highway Code.Steve Gooding, director of motoring research charity the RAC Foundation, said: ldquoNew road building is rare and where it does take place it is usually associated with housing estates.ldquoItrsquos all very well making provision for walking and cycling in these developments butthe shops, schools and doctorsrsquo surgeries that people need to get to are still miles away, then for many the car will remain the most practical method of travel..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: New roads should not prioritise cars, says health watchdog article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They should be required to include workforce representatives who can speak up for a fair balance of pay with ordinary workers.Rebecca Long-Bailey, shadow business secretary, said the report showed how ldquodisgracefully skewed the UKrsquos corporate culture had become in some circles.She said: ldquoThe Tories have done nothing to address such blatant inequality and they continue to push real aspiration further and further from the grasp of the majority of people in Britain..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title:  uFat Cat Friday u study highlights huge gap in pay between execs and staff article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

According to the latest Real Estate Outlook report from CBRE, there was take-up of , sq ft of office space across  transactions, in . It says that was more than double the figure a year earlier. Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre. We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34453454454.jpg","title":"supporting belfast start ups on the rise","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business The UK’s digital tech sector has attracted more capital than any other European country and Belfast has established itself as a key hub, writes Roisin Byrne, business director, Hays Northern Ireland The  Tech Nation report makes it clear that digital tech makes an essential contribution to our local economy with clusters and start-ups forming primarily around AI , machine learning, cyber security and big data industries. The Belfast start-up community ecosystem is alive and well and has carved out a reputation in the wider tech community for having good access to talent, funding and transport links. It also benefits from great workspaces such as Ormeau Baths, Farset Labs and the Innovation Centre at Catalyst Inc. Indeed, the city is bubbling with entrepreneurial talent as demonstrated by the large number of start-ups which have launched in the last two years. Belfast boasts a disproportionate number of the UK’s high growth firms and it is estimated that the local ecosystem now supports around , jobs. Hays has worked with a number of these start-ups as they have scaled up operations – firms such as Analytics Engines, Uleska and Vox to name a few. As part of our commitment to the sector we’ve also taken space in Ormeau Baths which has become an epicentre for tech meet-ups, hackathons and pitch events. It’s also a campus for early stage and growth stage start-ups to network, share experience and build scalable, globally focussed businesses. In its first year, % of companies based in Ormeau Baths grew their teams and revenues, and raised over £m in venture funding. We’ve also launched a new national initiative called Super Connect delivered by Empact Ventures which aims to help tech start-ups and scale-ups to explore collaboration with large organisations and funding providers through a series of venture labs and pitch days. The initiative brings together corporates, SMEs, angel investors, venture capitalists, grant providers, loan funds and crowdfunding s to explore supporting these start-ups and scale-ups. Details can be found at www.superconnectseries. In an increasingly competitive marketplace Hays sees real value in the innovative ideas start-ups are using to network and build traction and as they scale up to the next stage we are providing material support and employer value branding to help them attract the talent they need.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
