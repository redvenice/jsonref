First he filed chapter 11 bankruptcy, claiming he \u0027couldn\u0027t afford\u0027 the $5million demo cost. That was dismissed.Then he filed an appeal against Judge Karlan\u0027s order to tear down the giant house. That too was denied.He went to California\u0027s Supreme Court to try to save his project.

The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) said 94 of these related to missing periods and 365 to heavier menstrual bleeding. “In the vast majority of cases, reports were received directly from a vaccinated woman describing a menstrual disturbance with no associated medical condition,” the regulator said in its latest update on vaccine safety.Latest investigations by the safety committee of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) suggest there may be “short-lived changes” in menstrual patterns, including absence of menstrual bleeding and heavier-than-usual menstrual bleeding following mRNA vaccination, the HPRA said.“This further assessment is part of routine ongoing safety monitoring, and the EMA has stated that, at this stage, it is not yet clear whether there is a causal link between the Covid-19 vaccines and reports of changes in menstrual patterns. There is also no evidence to suggest that Covid-19 vaccines affect fertility.”The EMA has also reviewed studies of 65,000 pregnancies and found the data “reassuring”.“The review found no sign of increased risk of pregnancy complications, miscarriages, preterm births or adverse effects in the unborn babies following mRNA Covid-19 vaccination.”Suspected side-effectsMore than 1,000 reports of suspected side-effects following either a third or booster dose of Covid-19 have been received by the authority.By February 8th, 1,077 reports of suspected side-effects had been received following the administration of 2.7 million third – or booster – doses, according to its latest safety update.About one in every 2,250 children who has so far received a Covid-19 vaccine has reported a suspected side-effect, the update shows.A total of 346 reports of suspected side-effects in young people have been made after administration of the Pfizer vaccine. This related to the delivery of 780,000 doses to under-18s up to February 8th.A total of 54 of the reports related to a child – general vaccination of five to 11 year olds began last month – and the rest related to adolescents aged 12-17.Overall, the authority says, the reports received are consistent with the types of reports received for adults, with most being mild to moderate in nature. Many had resolved or were resolving at the time of reporting, it said.Weakness and chest painThe most commonly reported side-effect among children (325 reports) was “general symptoms and local reactions” such as tiredness, weakness, chest pain and feeling hot. Other significant categories were nervous system issues such dizziness, headache, fainting or feeling faint (237) and gastrointestinal complaints such as nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain (142).Overall, the HPRA has received a total of 19,468 reports of side-effects, relating to about 10.5 million administered vaccines and boosters – equivalent to one report for every 540 doses.About 40 per cent of suspected side-effects had resolved or were resolving at the time of reporting.

This means the requirement for masks in shops, on public transport and in schools will end on Monday week. Most schools are closed for the mid-term break next week, so Friday – for schools not closed due to the weather – will be the last day pupils will be required to wear a mask.The well-trailed decision to remove the mask mandate received a muted reception, with some dissenting voices.Premature decisionDr Tomas Ryan of the Independent Scientific Advisory Group – which has advocated a “zero Covid” approach – described the decision as premature, saying masks should be retained in schools for “the next few months” as most primary school children were not vaccinated.People Before ProfitSolidarity TD Paul Murphy said it was disappointing Nphet had recommended mask-wearing in retail, public transport and schools become optional. While some critics of the decision referred to a “spike” in hospitalisations of children with Covid-19, the Health Service Executive said the number of under-15s with Covid in hospital last Tuesday was 33, down from 43 the previous week.

The move by the Irish Province of the Order of Carmelites mirrors steps by the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin to seek zoning that would allow housing to be built on dozens of church sites in the city.In a public submission to Dublin City Council on its new development plan, the order said a 2.6-hectare site at Fortfield Road was surplus to its requirements for education and could be developed for housing. The site is between Terenure and Templeogue villages. Any income generated from future development would be used to finance school building and repair, as well as supporting the school’s ethos and the “charitable work and needs” of the Carmelites in Ireland and abroad. Junior school closureThe push to rezone such lands for housing follows the 2018 closure of the private Terenure College Junior School. The fee-paying Terenure College secondary school at the site has 740 students. The submission said there was no intention to increase the number of students beyond that number, nor was there “any significant need in the locality” for additional places in the school.The Carmelites said the development of housing would have “no adverse impact on the operations of the school”, adding that it would be left with an area of 19.7 hectares, including a lake and adjoining woodland, which could be offered as a formal public open space if residential development was brought forward. “The lands north and northwest of the college are no longer required or used for institutional use and there are more than adequate grounds available for sports associated with the college,” stated the submission to the council for the order by planning consultants John Spain Associates.‘Sustainable development’The 38-page report backing up the submission states that the council’s proposal to tighten the zoning rules governing sites such as the school lands would have a “severe and damaging effect on the proper planning and sustainable development” of the property,The archdiocese made similar arguments, in its separate submission, against the proposed zoning change, which precludes housing or office developments in all but “highly exceptional” circumstances.The order said the application of such restrictions “would result in far more lands being reserved for the school than any other school within the county whether considered on a per-student or per-school basis”. The submission said it was apparent that the school was “very generously served by the institutional lands” on which they sit. “The current and future needs of the school and the local community can be comfortably met on the remaining lands.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"nphet advises end to most mask wearing rules","story":"Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan has made a new proposal for the future management of Covid-19, in what is being seen as a significant step towards standing down the National Public Health Emergency Team in its current form.Dr Holohan told a meeting of the team on Thursday a proposal has been given to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly on the path ahead, and said the meeting could be the last held by Nphet in its current form.He thanked the members for their service, in case he did not get another chance to do so. No time and date has been set for the next meeting. One source at the meeting said the impression they got was: “We’re done.” A move to a more normalised approach, out of the emergency stance that gave rise to Nphet, is now seen as highly likely by multiple sources. This would entail the disease being managed without the input of a body comprised of outside experts such as Nphet, and instead being managed through existing structures. But the final decision rests with Mr Donnelly.The meeting also agreed a significant shake up to testing and masking in the country. Under a new masking regime, masks will only be needed in healthcare settings, and the advice to mask on public transport, in retail settings and in schools will lapse. The advice will be finalised in a letter to Mr Donnelly. The regulation-based approach to mask-wearing will no longer be in place, sources said. However, it will still be seen as important, and people will be encouraged to wear masks if they feel more comfortable in so doing - especially on public transport, which is a crowded setting that people cannot avoid. The meeting also agreed to issue new advice to Government that would radically change the testing system for Covid-19. It is understood testing will be focused on the over 55s, those who are are vulnerable, and those who live with someone in those categories. Otherwise, the advice will be for people to self-isolate if they are sick with Covid symptoms until they have abated. Close contacts will not need to seek a PCR test. It is thought that unvaccinated and unboosted people will still be advised to seek a test. The changes to masking and testing have been advised to come into place at the end of February.It is expected that the Government will accept the advice.Meanwhile, the Department of Health said they have been another 5,035 positive cases of Covid-19 confirmed by PCR testing in Ireland. In addition, a further 4,406 people registered a positive antigen test through the HSE portal.

magnitude have inevitably sparked fears that another boom-and-bust cycle is under way.As buyers have scrambled to purchase the limited number of new and second-hand homes on the market, the scarcity

I crouch behind him, clutching my robust but battered high-def camera. A few feet away, a snarling F-35B Lightning Stealth Fighter, sleek as a shark and every bit as lethal, prepares to launch into the steel-grey skies of the eastern Mediterranean.On the bridge, the navigators steer directly into the wind. ‘Steady on designated flying course, one-one-zero,’ says the officer of the watch.  ‘Steady on one-one-zero, sir,’ confirms the helmsman.The F-35B needs plenty of headwind to get airborne. The aircraft has a run-up of only 350 feet to the curved ‘ski-jump’, from which it will make its final leap skywards. Inside the glass-encased flight control tower behind us, the vessel’s Commander Air, Ed Phillips, aka ‘Wings’, looks up and down the massive flight deck and, when satisfied all is clear, gives a short sharp order:All eyes turn to the green flag held aloft and rippling in the wind.

I’ve witnessed this many times and know what to expect. It’ll be exhilarating, for sure, but also terrifying and probably painful. I’m determined to capture on film a spectacular close-up of a launch as near to the aircraft as possible, but the timing is critical and so far I’ve manifestly failed to pull it off.The searing blast from the rear jet nozzle has always blown me off my feet and sent me sprawling. I have the bruises and cuts to show for it and God knows how much skin I’ve now invested in the roughened, diamond-hard surface of the flight deck. But I still don’t have the footage I want. This time, two hefty sailors are ready to hold me down, or at least try to. My fear is that no amount of muscle power will be a match for the explosive thrust of what is essentially a horizontal rocket.The pilot releases the brakes and opens the throttle. The Pratt \u0026amp Whitney afterburning, turbofan engine raises its pitch to a terrifying scream as the aircraft surges forward. I clench my teeth, tense my muscles and, with my heart pounding in my ears, bear hug the camera in a semi-stable position. But how long can I hold on? Four vice-like hands press down on my hunched shoulders.It’s June 2021 and I’ve joined the ship’s company of HMS Queen Elizabeth for her first operational deployment. We are some weeks into a seven-month voyage to the South China Sea, not on exercise but, locked, loaded and ready for action, should it become necessary.The new carrier and fleet flagship, together with eight escorts (destroyers, frigates, supply ships and a submarine) comprise Carrier Strike Group 21 (CSG21) – the most powerful naval force to leave the UK in a generation. Prior to our transit through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea, on our way to the Pacific and the disputed waters of the South China Sea, the ship has been launching waves of jets on Operation Shader – in support of land forces in the fight against Islamic State in Syria. But this has prompted a reaction from the Russians. They consider this part of the Med their own backyard and are intent on letting the QE and her escorts know they’re not welcome here. But the QE is the new dog on the block and she’s here to mark her own territory, not with a wag of the tail but a snarl.Today’s launch of the F-35s, therefore, is not to attack IS but to ward off Russian warplanes attempting to overfly us. Pilots, drawn from the Fleet Air Arm, RAF and US Marine Corps, have been scrambling all day, sometimes in rapid two-minute intervals, to intercept ‘red bandits’ and escort them away at a safe range.The Russians, apart from wanting to goad the Royal Navy, are desperate to get a closer look at the QE, the most advanced aircraft carrier in the world, and also test the Task Group’s reaction procedures – not only in the air but also on the surface, with their warships, and underwater with their submarines. The QE’s Anti-Submarine Warfare Merlin Mk2 helicopters from 820 Naval Air Squadron are on constant patrol in order to monitor subsurface incursions and react accordingly. Nobody has actually opened fire, but there’s a lot of posturing and tactical lip-curling. If this is the start of a new Cold War, nobody is in doubt that things could heat up very quickly. The QE’s magazines are bursting with bombs, bullets and missiles of all descriptions and capabilities, as you’d expect on a warship that is now Britain’s main conventional strategic deterrent.Commodore Steve Moorhouse, leading CSG21, knows that Britain’s potential adversaries, the Russians and Chinese, will prod and poke his Task Group at every opportunity. ‘They want to see what we’re made of,’ he freely admits. ‘And I’m happy to show them, but professionally, in a spirit of confidence, not confrontation.’ Moorhouse is a steely commander but also a diplomat by default. After all, HMS Queen Elizabeth, a chunk of British sovereign territory, is part warship, part floating embassy. As the embodiment of ‘Global Britain’, her charge is to deliver ‘power projection’ on behalf of the nation: on the one hand that means hard-edged, lethal warfare on the other it’s about soft, political persuasion through deterrence, as well as overt support for allies around the world.Friends and foes alike will be watching this deployment with keen interest and I’m here to capture it on film for a forthcoming BBC TV series. But this isn’t the first time I’ve filmed HMS Queen Elizabeth. That was back in 2009, when I witnessed Princess Anne cutting the ship’s first steel at Govan shipyard in Glasgow. This was not so much the birth of Britain’s biggest-ever warship – more like her conception – and I was struck by the enormity of the occasion.  Sir Jonathon Band, the First Sea Lord at the time, spoke with passion to the audience and assembled media. The Queen Elizabeth Class of aircraft carrier, comprising HMS Queen Elizabeth, with HMS Prince of Wales to follow, would, he explained, ‘provide Britain with the means to deliver air power from the sea, wherever and whenever required, and in a stronger and more decisive form than ever before’. They will also, he added, ‘be the centrepiece of Britain’s military capability for many years to come’.The construction of HMS Queen Elizabeth and her sister ship meant a complete reinvention of the Royal Navy but, despite Sir Jonathon’s upbeat messaging, it was to prove a painful and long-drawn-out process. Our active carriers at the time, Ark Royal, Illustrious and Invincible, were about to be axed in the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review and with them the Navy’s Harrier squadron – its entire naval fixed-wing capability. Already, naysayers and vocal critics were provoking a heated debate over the pros and cons of a carrier-centric Navy, and whether there’d be enough escort ships to protect the carriers while at sea or sufficient sailors to man them – each would be three times the size of the Invincible Class carriers.General Sir Peter Wall, former head of the British Army, described the decision to build the new carriers as no more than a ‘vanity project’ that ‘lacked credibility’ and which could be seen to have ‘skewed the UK’s conventional defence effort to a damaging degree’. Max Hastings, ever the provocateur, suggested the new warships represented delusions of grandeur for a Navy in decline. Other denigrators were quick to point out that a large carrier is a big target – especially for the new generation of hypersonic missiles that the Chinese call ‘carrier killers’.Russia inevitably chimed in with some of its own political trash talk: ‘Just make sure you keep your new carrier away from Moscow’s warships or they’ll send it to the bottom of the sea.’Military hardware is an emotive subject, especially in the context of huge capital expenditure that might otherwise be spent on housing, welfare or the NHS, but £6 billion for two vessels (albeit a near doubling of the original budget) is modest compared to the eye-watering price tag of USS Gerald R. Ford, an American super-carrier of similar proportions which cost more than $13 billion (and which, according to the Pentagon, ‘has yet to demonstrate it can effectively defend itself from anti-ship missiles and other threats’).The glossy brochure issued by a conglomerate of shipbuilders known as the Aircraft Carrier Alliance certainly suggested that Britain was getting its money’s worth. At 65,000 tonnes, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales would not only be the biggest warships ever built for the Royal Navy, but also the most powerful and advanced in terms of military technology and stealth capabilities – especially when married eventually to the state-of-the-art F-35B Lightning jet fighter.The sales pitch for the super-carriers came with a staggering array of facts and figures. The ships, it claimed, would be so highly automated they’d require only ‘lean-manned’ crews – less than 1,000 per ship, without aircrew. That’s broadly one fifth the size of an American crew on a similar-sized ship. They’d each have a four-acre flight deck, the size of three and a half football fields, nine decks and a hangar big enough to fit two Type 23 frigates side by side. Each carrier would have two propellers weighing 33 tonnes – exerting the same thrust as 50 high-speed trains and producing a maximum speed in excess of 27 knots (31mph). The six engines (two mighty gas turbines and four diesels) would produce enough energy to power a city the size of Swindon the electrical cabling and wiring would stretch six times round the world the ship, weighing the same as 35,000 family cars, would carry enough fuel to take those cars to the moon and back a dozen times… and on it went.The statistics were mind-boggling, but one thing was for sure: the challenge of building the first of these ships – the nine-decked HMS Queen Elizabeth – manning her, taking her to sea and getting her battle-ready was going to be a compelling story, as I learnt while following her construction in seven shipyards around the UK, culminating in her final assembly at Rosyth in Fife, like some gargantuan Lego toy. But, engineering aside, I knew that her real story would reside in the sailors yet to arrive the men and women who would breathe life into the country’s first super-carrier.  Foremost among them was Jerry Kyd, the ship’s first seagoing captain. I encountered him on the day he arrived in Rosyth in May 2016, as he addressed a fledgling ship’s company of just 456 sailors standing in front of their ship, still an inert hulk without propellers and dead in the water.‘The world’s a frisky place at the moment,’ he said. ‘And we have to be ready to respond to threats which I think are coming sooner rather than later.’ Kyd glanced towards their future home, encased in scaffolding. ‘HMS Queen Elizabeth, as big and sophisticated as she might be, is really just a huge metal box, full of pipes, wires, gadgetry and computer terminals. She’s missing one vital ingredient…’ He paused dramatically. ‘Without the flesh, blood, muscle and hearts of you, my sailors, that ship is just a robot. You, not the ship, are the most important resource at my disposal.’It was nearly a year before the QE was ready for her first sea trials. As a ‘new build’, there were bound to be problems. On the eve of our departure for the North Sea, Captain Kyd warned that there would be emergencies: ‘We’ll have floods, we’ll have fires. And casualties too. That’s the nature of this business.’For the best part of two months the ship was put through her paces off the coast of Scotland, where I joined them. The first aircraft, a Merlin helicopter, was landed on the flight deck within four days as the ship’s company got used to their largely subterranean existence deep in the belly of the beast. I watched with amazement as the sailors, many of them straight out of training, transformed the massive grey hulk not only into a working warship but a home from home. The QE was fast becoming a vibrant floating city and, with 23 nations represented from across the Commonwealth, all human life was here. My first challenge, however, was to learn my way round a ship longer than the Houses of Parliament and taller than Nelson’s Column and so gigantic that it boasted five kilometres of passageways and 3,200 compartments.Apart from a serious issue with a cracked thrust block that held one of the drive shafts in place, all went as well as could be expected. As Jerry Kyd foretold, there were plenty of fires and floods as the ship was pushed to breaking point so that her technical and seagoing limits could be identified. There were ‘casualties’ too, but thankfully only minor ones – the worst being cracked teeth and broken fingers. Sea trials completed, we finally entered Portsmouth dockyard, the ship’s designated home port, and within months the QE was officially commissioned by the Queen.After a period of maintenance, the ship set off for the next vital stage of her trials off the eastern seaboard of the US. Within hours of leaving Portsmouth we became aware of an ominous presence – a Russian Federation frigate called Admiral Makarov had closed to within two miles of our position. A highly capable warship armed with Kalibr long-range cruise missiles, the Makarov was in transit from the Baltic to Sevastopol on the Black Sea. While officially permitted to route through the English Channel she had clearly erted her course to have a closer look at our ship.  A few days later, just before starting our transatlantic crossing, we were suddenly erted into the Irish Sea to help chase off a Russian submarine spotted in British territorial waters. There was an increasing concern, as there still is, that Russians could be sussing out British underwater power and communication cabling – an obvious target for a potential enemy.  The Russian sub made a run for it as soon as we got close. Even before the QE had become operational the writing was on the wall and it was written very clearly in Cyrillic script. A sign of things to come (and indeed I write this as the world tries to second-guess Russian designs on Ukraine).Following this brief ersion we progressed across the Atlantic and the next dramatic event I witnessed was the ship’s first-ever run ashore in a foreign port, which didn’t go entirely to plan. In Mayport, Florida, after a night of heavy drinking, four sailors from the QE and two from our escort frigate, HMS Monmouth, were arrested for a range of alcohol-related offences including jaywalking, fighting and resisting arrest. Despite making headlines on both sides of the Atlantic, the episode was soon forgotten and at least part of the blame was attached to overzealous policing.  Captain Kyd, a pragmatist, reckoned that a night in jail was punishment enough for sailors letting off steam. ‘The question we have to ask ourselves,’ Kyd told his commanders, ‘is what sort of sailor would we want to go to war with? The automaton who obeys every rule, plays it safe and never takes chances? Or the free spirit who pushes his luck and breaks the odd rule?’    Kyd quickly refocused on the job in hand – namely to see an F-35B Lightning jet land on the ship’s flight deck for the first time. Helicopters were one thing, but a fighter jet that lands vertically using immense downward thrust from its enormous engine was quite another. Commander Nathan Gray, the Navy’s top test pilot, was the first to attempt a landing. It went without a hitch, although many questions remained about safety margins before the flight deck and aircraft could be handed over to front-line combat pilots. Two months of continuous, painstaking testing in all weathers, including a full-blown hurricane, gradually provided the answers. Gray, despite a few near misses, was satisfied that he and his colleagues had done all they could to ready the ship and aircraft for action.  And so to the present. Here I am aboard the QE once again – no longer on sea trials, but busy arm-wrestling the Russians, and before long she’ll be playing cat-and-mouse with the Chinese in the South China Sea. This is the acid test, with much at stake. The Prime Minister has declared he wants the Royal Navy to be the most powerful and influential in Europe by the end of the decade. CSG21 is the first step to achieving that ambition and proving that the new aircraft carrier is no white elephant but an effective instrument of government as well as an iconic symbol of nation.  Great adventure beckons and, once again, all life is here – a much expanded ship’s company of 1,650 men and women. Yes, there are the aviators yes, there are the seafarers yes, there are the marine engineers. But there are so many others: stewards, chefs, medics, gunners, aircraft handlers, writers, warfare specialists, physical trainers and intelligence officers. There is even a specialist chocolatier and, maybe because of him, a dedicated dentist and dental hygienist.‘Bleeding frozen chips!’ shouts Ronnie Lambert, an Essex boy, born and bred. ‘They want 10 more boxes in the main galley and they’re all at the back of the frickin’ fridge.’‘Well, get in there and pull ’em out,’ laughs fellow storeman Aaron Mackin. ‘It’s yer bleedin’ job.’‘Well, I’m transferring to aviation! Them boys have it easy up there. All sunshine and sea.’    The F-35B, accelerating from a standing start, rattles my bones. The heavyset sailors push down hard on my prone body as I attempt to point the camera in the right direction. The sailors are now lying on top of me – the jet stream strikes and skittles us. I roll across the deck, trying to protect my camera. Did I capture the moment of take off? I will check as soon as I can. Lying on my back I look up to see five British F-35s close in on three Russian MiGs.There will be more Russian warplanes soon. They’ll keep coming, but at least we know one thing: we have chips to go with our fish tonight. Must be a Friday.More from NewsStorm Eunice latest: Red weather warning for London as powerful winds blast Britain\u0026#39Ukraine has every right to apply for Nato membership\u0026#39: Readers on the week\u0026#39s biggest storiesNational Trust project for the Platinum Jubilee will restore ‘historic, lost avenues of trees’EU claims Mad Cow Disease is why it must retag cows\u0026#39 ears in Northern IrelandOlivia Colman to star in BBC adaptation of Great ExpectationsWhy world leaders don’t trust Vladimir Putin with their DNAMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"benedict cumberbatch questions netflix short cinema run oscar","story":"Benedict Cumberbatch has questioned Netflix executives over his Oscar-nominated film’s limited run in cinemas.Cumberbatch stars in Netflix’s award season favourite The Power Of the Dog, and is thought to be working with the streaming service again on an upcoming Roald Dahl adaption, but has nevertheless questioned the company’s policies.Although Netflix is predominantly a streaming platform, the British star has taken aim at executives over a two-week cinematic run allotted for The Power of the Dog, which has allowed the film to qualify for the Oscars it is now predicted to dominate.Cumberbatch, nominated for a Best Actor award for his portrayal of a closeted rancher in the film, has asked executives: “Could you not afford to have a longer theatrical release?”Speaking to Vanity Fair, the actor addressed his question to Netflix’s head of original films Scott Stuber, the company’s chief content officer Ted Sarandos, and “everyone who runs Netflix”.His comments come following rumours he is set to play Sugar in Wes Anderson’s adaptation of Dahl stories The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar - another Netflix production.Netflix is thought to have more than 220 million subscribers worldwide, and its production of original, big-budget films has been seen by some as posing a threat to traditional cinemas by allowing viewers to see big releases at home.The streaming giant has however offered short cinematic releases for its productions, which has allowed critically-acclaimed productions like Roma to fit the criteria for the Oscars, which stipulate that films must be shown on the big screen.Multi-award-winning director Steven Spielberg has insisted in the past that Netflix makes films that “are just given token qualifications in a couple of theatres for less than a week”, and that they “deserve an Emmy (TV award), but not an Oscar”.Cannes has also taken a hard line on Netflix by barring its productions from the annual film festival because they do not have a French theatrical release.Weighing into rumbling industry debates, Cumberbatch has said that he is in a position to critique contemporary issues in cinema, saying: “If I’m in the belly of the beast, then surely I can start asking questions of it.”However, the star has conceded that he doesn’t know whether The Power of the Dog could have run in cinemas for longer.He told Vanity Fair: “I don’t know. I’m positioning this as a question publicly… I haven’t actually had this conversation with them (Netflix executives), but I would and I will.”Cumberbatch, who rose to fame for his leading role in BBC series Sherlock, is tipped for Oscars glory in Jane Campion\u0027s artistic piece The Power of the Dog, but has also enjoyed box-office success in the popular Marvel franchise as Doctor Strange.Along with asking questions of Netflix, he has commented on the influence of Marvel in the world of cinema, saying that without the pull of stars from superhero franchises “financing any film” is difficult.He added that this was true “no matter how important the story, no matter how urgent the story, no matter how talented and awarded and appreciated the artist is”, and has asked himself whether he is “working for the Goliath that’s killing the David”.While Doctor Strange has not swept the Oscars, The Power of the Dog has earned 12 Academy Award nominations ahead of the 2022 ceremony, including for best picture, best director, and best-adapted screenplay.Despite criticism from some in the film industry, Netflix productions have performed well at the Oscars, with awards going to original titles including Mank, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, American Factory, and Marriage Story.Martin Scorsese’s mobster epic The Irishman was also nominated for a slew of awards in 2020.Netflix has been contacted for comment.The Vanity Fair Hollywood Issue is available via digital download and on newsstands on Friday, 25 FebruaryMore from NewsStorm Eunice latest: Red weather warning for London as powerful winds blast Britain\u0026#39Ukraine has every right to apply for Nato membership\u0026#39: Readers on the week\u0026#39s biggest storiesNational Trust project for the Platinum Jubilee will restore ‘historic, lost avenues of trees’EU claims Mad Cow Disease is why it must retag cows\u0026#39 ears in Northern IrelandOlivia Colman to star in BBC adaptation of Great ExpectationsWhy world leaders don’t trust Vladimir Putin with their DNAMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"boris make nick clegg one powerful men britain","story":"When they first stood together in the Rose Garden of Downing Street, few would have guessed where David Cameron and Nick Clegg would ultimately end up. The former prime minister has slipped into obscurity: mocked, ignored and having virtually no place in public debate. But his erstwhile deputy is now enthroned in Silicon Valley as global affairs chief of Facebook. He’s one of the most powerful men in the world – and I wish that was an exaggeration.Murdoch, Hearst, Beaverbrook: none exercised as much power over the world’s news as Clegg is now capable of doing. After the broadcasters, Facebook is Britain’s number one source of news. Its users may think they’re just seeing what they selected – based on who they follow, what they share. But what they actually get is a selection, chosen by algorithms under criteria programmed by Silicon Valley workers. All overseen by the likes of Clegg. In this way, Facebook can edit the way tens of millions see the world.The power that all this gives to Silicon Valley is matched only by the utter ignorance in government about its nature and implications. And that’s why Boris Johnson is unwittingly about to give Clegg – and all the Big Tech firms – more power than ever. In a cackhanded attempt to bring them all to heel, the Online Safety Bill will transform Big Tech into our new censors. They’ll obey government orders on a certain number of things, but in return they get the power – nay, duty – to police the rest pretty much as they see fit.The original idea is sensible: to tackle pornography, criminality, content encouraging suicide: in other words, genuine online filth. But how to do this in a country with free speech rules? The Online Safety Bill invents a new category – “legal, but harmful” – with fines imposed on any digital publisher that crosses this vaguely drawn line. The danger, of course, lies in the grey areas. What about articles questioning vaccine policy – are they “harmful”? Or Jimmy Carr’s gypsy jokes? Facebook won’t want to be fined or take the risk. The bots will be told: if in doubt, strike it out.Consequences can be seen already, with government critics first going digitally missing. The Socialist Workers Party found its Facebook page vapourised. Novara Media, an upstart socialist broadcaster, had its YouTube page taken down. In both cases, services were resumed after an uproar over-zealous censorship bots were blamed. But this draws attention to something we were never really told: that such bots already are at work, trawling cyberspace, identifying troublemakers and closing them down.Clegg has never cared much about free speech. As deputy prime minister, he tried to force newspapers to submit to government regulation, but his job now is to maximise Facebook’s profits. It makes money by showing adverts, with “likes”, “shares” and Baby Shark videos: unlike the media moguls, Silicon Valley doesn’t care about news. It has no interest in defending minority voices. Its general approach is: we’ll do anything, just don’t fine us! In fact, we can be your censors! Look how well we’d do it!The Covid era saw Silicon Valley demonstrating just how effective a censor it can be. Facebook boasted that it was “working with government” to combat “misinformation” – which it seemed to define as stories unhelpful to No 10. As a viewer, you won’t miss what you don’t see. But editors like me (even The Spectator swims in a digital sea) soon find out which articles the censor bots dislike. For example, if our weekly YouTube show had criticism of lockdown policy, that episode might have mysteriously fewer viewers – probably because it’s withheld from YouTube’s all-powerful recommendation system. But we’re never told. Sometimes, an episode is deleted entirely.Articles, too, are judged harshly. During the debate about face masks, I commissioned an in-depth report from two academics, both experts in their field: they found the evidence unconvincing. The bots hated it and Facebook slapped a “false information” warning on it. I asked Facebook to identify a single error in the article. No response. It’s Facebook: it doesn’t have to respond. I wish I could say it doesn’t matter, but social media drives about a third of our website traffic (and, ergo, our sales). So yes, it matters.The British Medical Journal watched all this, thinking (rightly, as it turned out) that it would be next. In an editorial, it highlighted the risk this posed to basic scientific debate. “It seems 2020 is Orwell’s 1984, where the boundaries of public discourse are governed by multibillion dollar corporations (in place of a totalitarian regime),” it wrote. “And secret algorithms coded by unidentified employees.” Except we know the identity of one of the bosses: Sir Nick Clegg. And he’s about to be the new Big Brother. Quite a thought.Clegg himself is unlikely to delete Boris Johnson’s account (as Twitter did to Donald Trump) but Facebook could, if it wanted. This raises a question: should he have so much power? More to the point, should Clegg’s colleagues in San Francisco be deciding what Brits should be reading? Why can’t we see the criteria, or the decisions? Might we end up with the Left-wards bias, seen time and time again in social media in America?Reports of Covid leaking from a Wuhan lab were once seen, by Facebook, as fake news – and removed. Now they look all too plausible. The nature, power and influence of censorship bots is something that politicians struggle to imagine, let alone regulate. The BBC presents an easier, juicer, more understandable target. When the Online Safety Bill was introduced in Parliament, not a single MP asked about bots or speech protection. “My colleagues can’t see that this Bill would make us more exposed than ever to the wokeward drift of Silicon Valley,” says one minister. “It may soon be too late”.Boris Johnson has been pressing “pause” on a few policies of late, and the Online Safety Bill is the biggest disaster waiting to happen. In the four years that this Bill has been in the making, it has been rendered out of date because the dynamics of digital media and public debate have changed so much. If he goes ahead now, it would cement Clegg’s status as the most powerful Englishman in world media. There’s still time to stop, take stock and think of a better way.More from NewsStorm Eunice latest: Red weather warning for London as powerful winds blast BritainStorm Dudley and Storm Eunice  in pictures: Havoc as strong winds batter Britain\u0026#39Ukraine has every right to apply for Nato membership\u0026#39: Readers on the week\u0026#39s biggest storiesNational Trust project for the Platinum Jubilee will restore ‘historic, lost avenues of trees’EU claims Mad Cow Disease is why it must retag cows\u0026#39 ears in Northern IrelandOlivia Colman to star in BBC adaptation of Great ExpectationsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"olivia colman star bbc adaptation great expectations","story":"Olivia Colman is to star in the BBC adaptation of Charles Dickens\u0027 classic novel Great Expectations.The Oscar-winning actress, 48, will play wealthy spinster Miss Havisham in the coming-of-age story about an orphan nicknamed Pip.The six-part series will be created by Bafta-winning writer Steven Knight and is based on Dickens\u0027 tale, which was first released as a series of weekly chapters beginning in 1860 before it was later published as a novel.The cast will also feature Fionn Whitehead as Pip, alongside Ashley Thomas, Johnny Harris, Shalom Brune-Franklin, Hayley Squires, Owen McDonnell, Trystan Gravelle and Matt Berry.The series will also be executive produced by the team which was behind the BBC\u0027s 2019 adaptation of Dickens\u0027 A Christmas Carol -

Earlier this month, the Prime Minister announced that he was bringing forward the date at which the remaining legal restrictions would end. The NHS has not faced, as some had feared, an unsustainable wave of omicron admissions this winter. Thanks, in part, to the success of the booster programme, the UK has remained relatively free, certainly when compared to some European countries.There is a risk, however, that the formal end of the last legal measures will not result in a full return to normality. There is a debate, for example, about the continued provision of “free” tests to the population, with the Labour leader saying that ending the policy would be a mistake. But it is becoming harder and harder to justify the huge sums of public money spent on this initiative. We do not spend billions of pounds testing for flu, so why should we do so for Covid, especially now that the vast majority of the population has been vaccinated? All it arguably encourages is unwarranted paranoia about the coronavirus.Then there is the continued risk aversion of some local authorities, schools and hospital trusts. Already, some public sector leaders have made it clear that they intend to keep some protocols in place for longer – seen, for example, in Sadiq Khan’s insistence that masks be worn on the Tube. This cannot be allowed to continue. The point of living with Covid is that iniduals should make their own minds up about the level of risk they are prepared to accept. That is impossible if arms of the state still feel entitled to tell people what to do.More from NewsStorm Eunice latest: Red weather warning for London as powerful winds blast BritainStorm Dudley and Storm Eunice  in pictures: Havoc as strong winds batter Britain\u0026#39Ukraine has every right to apply for Nato membership\u0026#39: Readers on the week\u0026#39s biggest storiesNational Trust project for the Platinum Jubilee will restore ‘historic, lost avenues of trees’EU claims Mad Cow Disease is why it must retag cows\u0026#39 ears in Northern IrelandOlivia Colman to star in BBC adaptation of Great ExpectationsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dwp universal credit sanctions soar","story":"Exclusive: DWP Universal Credit sanctions soar to , a month in extremely worrying riseThe number of sanctions has shot from a few thousand a month to , - a similar proportion to before the pandemic - after the DWP brought back face-to-face Jobcentre appointments.

The shocking rise comes as millions of people are hit by rising living costs, with energy bills, National Insurance and inflation all surging this Spring while benefits rise by only .%.Sanctions were suspended in the first Covid lockdown, and remained low at first after being restored in summer . But they have soared since the Department for Work and Pensionsbrought back face-to-face Jobcentre appointments last April, with people who miss a session having their benefits cut or stopped.The number of Universal Credit claimants with a sanction rose from , in June  to , in November , the most recent month available. Scroll down for the full figures and join the debate in the comments. Have you received an unfair sanction  Tell us on webnews@mirror. The total number of people sanctioned across the whole month will be higher than the official figures, as they are taken on a particular day each month. The data also excludes Universal Credit claimants who are not in ‘conditionality’ groups, such as severely disabled people.And Tory ministers are now introducing even tighter rules, with claimants facing a sanction after four weeksthey refuse a job outside their chosen field, which could push sanctions higher. Anti-austerity activist Charlotte Hughes warned it was “extremely worrying as we face a huge cost of living crisis putting energy and food prices up”.  She added: “Sanctions are a cruel and unnecessary tool to use against those that are already poor and living in poverty. “Benefit sanctions ensure a person or a family are dragged further into poverty, making them have to choose whether they can eat or heat for the duration of their sanction.“Sanctioning claimants creates a never ending circle of poverty and does not encourage anyone to look for more work.” Dr David Webster of the University of Glasgow, who has researched the impact of sanctions for years, said: “The impact of a sanction often lasts a long time. “If it causes a crisis in the family, orit leads to somebody being evicted, the effects are pretty long-lasting. “Sanctions drive people further into debt, because obviously people can’t stop spending money altogether – they have to find something to eat and so on. “They have to keep spending money, somoney isn’t coming in they’re going to have to borrow it, and they get further in debt. “That has damaging effects on their mental health, because there’s all the anxiety and stress. And for a minority of people there’s obviously the question of potential eviction.”  The sharp rise comes even as the overall number of Universal Credit claimants has fallen with the reopening of the economy. DWP figures this week show .% of claimants were subject to a sanction in November, a similar proportion to before the pandemic. That is up from .% in October and .% in September. “If you look at the trend, there’s really virtually no slackening in the pace of increase in that percentage – it’s heading skywards,” said Dr Webster. The DWP’s recently announced Way to Work scheme will soon force claimants to look for jobs outside their chosen field after just four weeks on Universal Credit. A DWP spokesperson said: “With a record number of jobs available, it’s right that people who can work are encouraged to take up suitable roles through our Way to Work scheme. As well as being good for mental wellbeing, people are at least £, better off in full time work than on benefits. “People are only sanctionedthey fail, without good reason, to meet the conditions which they agreed to, and the latest data shows the sanctions rate remains below pre-pandemic levels.”Sanctions by month Figure is the number of people on the Universal Credit full service receiving a sanction on the second Thursday of each month.

The Lib Dems have tabled an Early Day Motion to release “all accompanying evidence” on gatherings in Downing Street and Whitehall, “including photographs”.Top civil servant Sue Gray gathered around  images and passed them to police, who are investigating  Westminster parties during lockdown. However, sources have said she is not set to publish the images, which it’s thought could include CCTV stills, when she produces a second report. And this week it emerged the Cabinet Office Liaison Unit has asked the Met Police to confirm it will not publish photos either, as part of its investigation. The Lib Dem motion would use the mechanism of a “humble address” to order a “full, unreacted report of the Cabinet Office” investigation to be published.  The government would also have to give “a full list of the names of any elected officials, senior civil servants, and political appointees” who are fined by police.This comes after the police and government suggested anyone who is fined will not be named, with Brits having to rely on Boris Johnson naming himself.But it is only an Early Day Motion designed to voice opinions on issues of the day, without a House of Commons debate. Tory ministers are under no obligation to give it any debating time, let alone a formal vote, on the floor of Parliament.And it’s understood Labour is not ordering its MPs to sign the motion.Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey urged MPs to back the motion regardless. He said: “Boris Johnson can’t be trusted to admit whether he or any other Conservative ministers end up being fined by the police. “We’ve seen time and again that his instinct is to lie, blame others or cover up the truth.” No staff feared publishing the damning pictures could harm their reputations, according to the Times. The Mirror has learned one photo shows Boris Johnson holding a bottle of beer at his own birthday party and was taken by his official photographer.Boris Johnson has until tomorrow night tohis Met Police Partygate questionnaire. The Prime Minister was issued with the quiz last Friday - and given seven days to send back the completed form.  He has been consulting lawyers over his responses - and is expected to resist any attempts to oust himhe is slapped with a fine.London mayor Sadiq Khan said it would be inappropriate for him to lean on police and ask them to release photos of the Downing Street parties.He told LBC: Just think how inappropriate it would be for me, a Labour Mayor, getting involved in operational matters where a Conservative politician is being investigated. There are some countries around the world where the police do have their arms twisted in relation to operational issues. I think it is right in our system where I have got no influence in relation to whether the police do investigate Boris Johnson, what is published and so forth. I have always, as the Mayor, been cognisant of the importance of me understanding which side of the line I should be on. Mr Johnson has already admitted attending some of the  gatherings under investigation - including  minutes at a birthday party in his honour, where a photo showed him holding a beer.But according toITVpolitical editor Robert Peston, the PM’s lawyers now believe the relevant test is whether he ed to “proper work” after the gatherings.Well-connected Mr Peston wrote: “If he can prove that he didnapost get drunk and incapacitated, and has proof that he resumed more conventional prime ministerial activities after the seeming parties, his legal advisors seem to think there is a chance he can prove said events were simply part of his working day. “Andhe got sozzled and went for a kip, heaposd be fined.” Adam Wagner, a human rights barrister who analyses Covid lockdown laws, said the argument about whether the PM went back to work afterwards is “irrelevant”. He told the Mirror: “It doesn’t matter what he did before or afterwards - the question is did he participate, andhe spent  minutes at a birthday gathering and there is a photo of him carrying a bottle of beer then he participated. “If someone was working in a building in central London and in the next room there was a rave, and they just popped into the rave for  minutes, it would be absurd to say they had a reasonable excuse. “There is no technical defence of ‘I went back to work’ - there is no technical defence of ‘I didn’t get drunk’. “’I held the beer, I didn’t get drunk’ is like Bill Clinton’s ‘I smoked marijuana but I didn’t inhale’ - it’s nonsense. I don’t understand that to be a defence which could work in the regulations.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonConservative PartyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Rules mean statutory sick pay, currently £. a week, is only available to employees earning £ per week or more – leaving two million low-paid workers, mostly women, without any sick pay at all.The demand comes as Boris Johnson prepares to outline the Government’s plan for “living with Covid” on Monday. He is expected to scrap laws forcing people to self-isolatethey test positive for coronavirus. A letter from TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady and FSB boss Martin McTague calls on the Chancellor to “ensure that all workers that need access to sick pay would receive it regardless of earnings, and make sure that all employers would be able to afford it”. Ms O’Grady said: “No one should be forced to choose between doing the right thing and self-isolating or putting food on the table. “But millions of low-paid workers have faced this impossible choice. “Two years into the pandemic, it’s time ministers stopped turning a blind eye to this obvious problem and fixed our broken sick pay system. “Delivering sick pay for all would be an important first step.” Mr McTague said: “Small business owners are struggling to find £billion a year for sick pay costs. “Last year, the Chancellor responded to our calls for help with a reintroduction of the small employer sick pay rebate until the end of March. “However, with inflation driving up business costs - and forthcoming NICs hikes increasing the tax burden on them to a level not seen since the s – there could not be a worse time to remove the rebate.” Shopworkersapos union Usdaw said “being ill has a huge financial impact on low-paid workers, as too many are forced to live on statutory sick pay”.General secretary Paddy Lillis said: Trade unions secured SSP from day one for Covid absences during the pandemic. “This must continue and be extended to all sickness absences, along with sick pay reflecting average pay and being available to all workers. Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “Learning to live with Covid is not the same as ignoring it and weakening statutory sick pay would be utterly irresponsible - forcing low-paid people to make choices between their health and putting food on the table.“Labour fought for the security of sick pay from day one from ministers when negotiating the original Covid Act two years ago.“But even this concession - important though it was - is not enough we still need decent sick pay for all. “Weakening statutory sick pay now would prove once again that Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak are not on the side of working people.” A Government spokesman said: “We understand how important sick pay has been for small businesses and employees during the pandemic, which is why employers with up to  staff can be reimbursed the cost of up to a fortnight’s statutory sick pay for Covid-related absences. “There is a package of financial support in place for workers who need to self-isolate. “To date, the Government has released £m to local authorities to fund £ support payments for those on the lowest incomes who need to self-isolate.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Trades Union CongressBoris JohnsonBritish economyPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Its p spaghetti is, like the proleration of food banks in the UK, a treatment of the symptom of poverty.We need to address the cause. The responsibility for the welfare and wellbeing of our most vulnerable citizens should not rest on the shoulders of charities, nor supermarkets. It’s easy to paint the large ­corporations as the villains, but questions need to be asked as to why people need p spaghetti and p pasta to survive in one of the richest economies in the world.  And the answers lie squarely at the well-heeled feet of those who have held the purse strings and policies of the country for the last  long and dismal years. Those years of austerity cuts to social care and health services mean the safety net of a decent and supportive society is less than threadbare. The triple threat of rocketing food prices, unmanageable energy bills, and an underfunded National Health Service is going to cause long-term damage to families, communities, and ­iniduals in almost every ­neighbourhood in the country. Every area now has at least one foodbank we live in a society where people need the ad-hoc macro philanthropy of neighbours and strangers to not starve to death.  Over the last two years of the pandemic, the Chancellor has proven time and again that he can magic up a whole orchard of flourishing and evergreen money trees when it comes to propping up his pet projects. Writing off £.billion of furlough fraud, £.billion “lost” down the back of the Downing Street couch, supposedly spent on PPE nobody has any record of, not even the company that received the payment. That money alone could have paid for TWO YEARS of the continuation of the £ uplt to Universal Credit. Somehow there is always money for crony contracts, Parliamentary p*ss-ups, weaponry and warfare, and DWP cover-ups, because it comes at the expense of social care, school dinners, and starving pensioners. So while I welcome the ­reappearance of budget groceries on the supermarket shelves as an ­immediate-term relief for millions of people struggling to make ends meet, and while I will continue to write recipes for p a head and publish them for free on my website, I’m determined that we work towards building a world where neither of those things are essential any more.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

Affordable property in London is almost unheard of, and while there is an East London flat that had just recently come on the market at a fairly cheap price, the snag is that it is also among the smallest in the city. The tiny studio flat in Clapton, Hackney is only  sq ft which means there is little living space but was being sold as a great way to get on the property ladder. In that space there’s a single bed, cupboard, shelves, microwave, space for a small fridge, fold-out table and a sink but no hobs. There’s also a separate wetroom fit with a toilet, sink, shower and towel rail.  Bidding for the property has already ended after an online auction on February , that had a starting price of £,.Due to the rarity of a flat being started at such a low price for East London, it had been expected to be hotly contested, reported MyLondon.To put it into context, the price tag is less than the average first-time buyer deposit, which is currently £,, according to Halax.  Stuart Collar-Brown, a director of My Auction, the online property company that was selling the studio, said: “The flat is small — but then again, you also can’t buy a long-leasehold property in central London for £, so it’s a great opportunity for someone to get on the ladder.” He believes it is the smallest flat on the market in London. The property has  years remaining on the lease and is on the first floor of a period conversion, within walking distance from the cafes, bars and restaurants on Chatsworth Road and Lower Clapton Road.Hackney Marshes, South Millfields Recreation Ground and Millfields Park are all close by, as are the Overground stations of Hackney Downs, Hackney Central, Homerton and Clapton. It has been confirmed that due to the size of the flat, a buyer wouldn’t qualy for a loan, but the auctioneer believes that’s the reason it will attract interest from investors. “It’s hardly surprising when the average rental yield in London is sub-%,” said Mr Collar-Brown. “Andbought at the guide price of £, this flat will produce just north of %, which means in just over five years’ time you’ll have made your money back.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON First-time buyersHousing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Sophia Scott was diagnosed with Sanfilippo Syndrome in  after her parents Darren,  and Amanda, , noticed dferences in her development. The rare genetic condition is a type of childhood dementia which also causes fatal brain damage.Sadly the average le expectancy for children suffering from the disease is between  to -years-old, but most donapost survive their teenage years. Darren, from Glasgow, has opened up about the heartbreaking reality of his daughteraposs condition and said watching her suffer is aposshatteringapos. He said her diagnosis came like a bolt of lightening as Sophia, who was previously fit and healthy, began to have dficulties with her speech and reading. Speaking to the Daily Record, Darren said: This has destroyed all of us. It turned our le upside down.Not a day, not a minute, goes by that it doesnapost flash through your head the sadness of it. We want to give Sophia the best le possible, eventhat is just things like taking Sophia on once in a letime trips. But it is hard trying to squeeze as much as possible into such a short time. It is obviously a very dficult and upsetting le. Darren Amanda have some very dficult medial decisions to make for their daughteraposs future and have to choose whether or not she will undergo potentially le-threatening surgery.  Her diagnosis came after a referral to speech therapy from the youngsteraposs nursery which eventually uncovered her terminal illness, also known as Mucopolysaccharidosis type III . As Sophiaaposs condition has progressed, her spine has curved which is now impacting her internal organs. Surgeons would like to do a major operation to fuse metal rods into her back, but the procedure does not come without its risks. The youngster previously had spinal surgery but the emotional impact of the decision was extremely dficult for the family. Darren said: It is a horrendous experience to have to live with and be a part of, especially with some of the decisions we have had to make recently.  When we went through the surgery with her a few years ago, it took everything out of us. These are decisions you donapost want to be thinking about for your child - never mind your child with a lower le expectancy than other children. Sophia is also now struggling to keep weight on and will most likely need another operation to insert a feeding tube. Despite the heartbreaking reality of the familyaposs situation, Darren and Amanda focus on short term goals so they can give Sophia a happy and positive le. Darren said: Watching Sophie become non-verbal and watching the condition take away all the things she has learnt is hard. But she is an absolute bundle of energy and joy. She is very bubbly and has crazy blonde hair with big blue eyes and an infectious smile.  The two things she loves the most are adventures and people. We wonapost give up on her. There is no cure yet, but there is research going on. Awareness is the only hope we have. For the past three years Darren and Amanda have launched a birthday fundraiser for Sophia with some cash going towards making memories and the rest being donated to medical research and charity. This year money will go towards aposfighting the incurable and progressive illnessapos as a donation will also be made to Sophiaaposs fantastic school Kelburn Park Primary. Sanfilippo Syndrome is a rare genetic metabolism disorder which leads to serious problems in the brain and nervous system.

Des Louza, a technical engineer from Wolverhampton, had no previous health conditions but rapidly deteriorated just a week after contracting the virus, reports BirminghamLive. Coronavirus visiting restrictions in the hospital meant he could only speak to his family for just  seconds over the phone before he was rushed to a new ward and placed in a coma. The granddad of three spent the next five weeks fighting for his le but tragically died last March.Now, his daughter is now fundraising to help keep National Covid Memorial Wall a permanent fixture in London. His daughter Jodie Louza said: He must have been panicking. He was very weak and he just said bye and I think in his head he thought he wouldnapost get to say bye to us. We had a -second phone call with him. We could tell it was taking all his strength to say bye, thataposs all he could physically say. We were just distraught. You can’t really prepare for that - not being able to see him or be next to him. It was really tough. The -year-old added: My dad was the picture of health for his age.  You really donapost know how easily it could be you or someone you love. People should not forget that it’s still out there. The last text he sent to his daughter was I’m doing my best to fight this, Jodie recalled. Technical engineer Mr Louza worked for firm Atlas Copco throughout the pandemic until he fell ill with coronavirus in December . Jodie and her mum Kate, , looked after him for about a week at their Bilston home and both caught coronavirus themselves in the process.  But five weeks after being placed in the coma, the close-knit family were only able to visit him when medics called to say he was not going to make it. Jodie and mum Kate - who was married to Mr Louza for almost  years - went to the Covid ward, donning HAZMAT suits and helmets to say their final goodbyes. Her two heartbroken brothers stayed behind after becoming terried they would end up catching Covid for the first time. Jodie, a receptionist, said: They couldnapost understand why it affected him in the way that it did. They were hoping they could wake him up.  We couldnapost hold him and be normal. It was heartbreaking, really hard to digest. I was stubborn, I kept telling myself he will keep fighting. He was a fighter and a very strong man. I had never seen him ill before. He was very into his health and fitness. He was very humble. He was very fit. He had looked the same since he was , he did not age. It was such a shock. He was brilliant with his advice, he was loved. We would always have family game nights and he was really competitive and didn’t like to lose. He was an inspiration. I still canapost really comprehend it. It’s nearly been a year and I still donapost understand it. Jodie added the family are unsure where he contracted Covid, as he strictly followed the rules. It could have been something as simple as someone in the supermarket passing him. He really deteriorated rapidly, she added.Just three days after Mr Louza died, the devastated family received an NHS letter saying he was now eligible for the vaccine.Jodie added: It was unimaginable. I was very worried about Covid. I had a lot of people in my age bracket saying it wouldnapost be that bad. It’s the worst thing in the world. Unless you have been through this, it’s hard to realise how dficult it is. He didnapost have the funeral he should have had, it was really controlled and not what we would have wanted. Jodie is now planning on running the Carver Wolverhampton Half Marathon in April in memory of her cherished dad. She has already raised more than £ for The National Covid Memorial Wall - a London-based mural honouring those lost during the pandemic. She said: I think he would be proud. I would like to think he would be at the finish line. I needed something to motivate me, to work towards. I think it’s easy to get lost in grief. It makes me feel better knowing I am doing something in his memory and knowing it’s going to benefit other people because I know we are not the only ones who have been through this.To donate to the familyaposs fundraiser, visit Jodieaposs GoFundMe.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Coronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ruby Cropper was crossing the road with a friend to play in Coronation Park in Radclfe, Greater Manchester, when she was catapulted  feet along the road by Andrew Cairns. Cairns, , had been weaving in and out of traffic and overtaking on the wrong side of the road before his Suzuki Alto ploughed into young Ruby at a speed estimated to be not less than mph.Manchester Crown Court heard that Cairns, who had previous driving-related convictions, left Ruby dying in the road and sped off, reports Manchester Evening News.Jamie Baxter, prosecuting, outlined what happened on August ,  at around .pm. He said: “Instead of waiting and pulling over, or calling an ambulance or asking for help, the defendant chose to drove away. “The force of the collision propelled her forwards  metresfrom the point of impact, where she came to rest on the opposite side of the carriageway near to a bus stop.  “Notwithstanding the efforts of decent members of the public, some sat with Ruby as she lay in the road, and efforts of well trained and dedicated ambulance service and medical professionals, she passed away in the early hours of August .” Crash experts concluded thatCairns had been driving to the mph limit, he would not have hit Ruby. The court heard Rubyaposs mum and older brother rushed to the scene, which was  yards from their family home, to hold her hand as she lay injured. She was airlted to hospital and her le support machine was turned off after two days with family at her bedside after doctors concluded her injuries were not survivable. One eyewitness who had been overtaken by Cairns moments before he crashed into Ruby, said he had been ‘driving like a looney’. Otherssaid they thought Cairns had been ‘driving super fast’ and ‘like he was on a racetrack’.  Cairns, who gave himself up shortly after, admitted causing death by careless driving on August , . But he was convicted unanimously by a jury of the more serious charge of causing death by dangerous driving following a trial in January and was sentenced on Thursday. Passing sentence, Judge Timothy Smith jailed Cairns for five years and gave him a seven-year driving ban. In emotional victim impact statements read to the court, Ruby’s brother Ryan Veitch, mum Shelley Booth and dad Ian Cropper each spoke of the terrible grief they have endured since Rubyaposs death. The sight of seeing her unconscious and dying in front of me is the worst thing I have ever had to deal with, Rubyaposs heartbroken mum said. She added: We lay with her and played her favourite music, took her hand and footprints, told her how much we loved her and were there until her last breath.  Mr Cropper spoke of his unbearable pain, adding: She made me happy when I was sad. She was my everything and itaposs hard to put into words the loss I feel. I will never heal from this. I will never recover from this. Judge Smith told the defendant he had an arrogant entitlement to drive at excessive speed. He added: This is a tragic reminder for all those who drive,speed limits are not observed the car we are driving can be a lethal weapon. The court heard Cairns had two previous convictions for drink-driving, including crashing and flipping his dadaposs Honda Civic and leaving the scene. Six months after the crash involving Ruby, Cairns was caught speeding at mph on the M. Rubyaposs family said she had become a le-saver through organ donation to three other people after her death and £, had been raised for North West Air Ambulance.

The snap could be spotted in pictures released yesterday that showed her holding an in-person audience with military officials at Windsor Castle.The audience took place in the castleaposs Oak Room, Her Majestyaposs private sitting room, and the lovely framed photo could be seen on a table behind her. Itaposs unclear where exactly the photo was taken - but it appears to have been at her Scottish Highlands retreat of Balmoral. In it, the Queen can be seen sitting on a sofa surrounded by nine of her younger relatives. Standing behind the sofa and posing for the camera appears to be her granddaughter, Lady Louise Windsor, beside her great-grandchildren Prince George, Isla Phillips, Princess Charlotte and Savannah Phillips. Meanwhile sitting beside her on the sofa appear to be Prince Louis, Mia Tindall and Lena Tindall. Therefore itaposs likely the baby she is cradling on her knee is Lucas Tindall, who was born last March. Missing from the snap are the Queenaposs other great-grandchildren - Prince Harryaposs children Archie, Lilibet, August Brooksbank and Sienna Mapelli Mozzi.

In footage of her audience, the monarch can be heard remarking loudly: “Oh. I’m here! I thought you might have just stayed in there for ages. Good morning.” Asked how she is, the smiling Queen, wearing a floral dress and holding a walking stick, points to her left leg or foot and responds: “Well as you can see I can’t move.” She is understood to have been feeling slightly stf, rather than having injured herself or being unwell. Later in the footage, Rear Admiral James Macleod remarks: “Well, many congratulations on the start of your Jubilee year”, with the Queen saying: “Oh thank you very much indeed.” Major General Eldon Millar adds: “She gave a little growl as we came in.” The Queen replies: “Oh really …she doesn’t normally growl.” Rear Admiral Macleod replies: “She obviously can see through us.”Yesterdayaposs audience was also the Queenaposs first in-person appearance since her Covid scare a week ago, suggesting she may have escaped the virus despite coming into contact with Prince Charles, who tested positive two days later.Buckingham Palace declined to comment.

The furiously private couple, who were married for  years, would remain professional in public settings or during royal engagements, so it was rare to see any sort of affection. But a royal insider has shared an insight into what went on behind the scenes. Designer Ian Thomas, who worked with the Queen for more than  years, recalled the moment that Prince Philip made Her Majesty blush. Speaking on Channel aposs Secrets of Royal Dressmakers, royal expert Ingrid Seward shared the sweet story which took place while Thomas adjusted the hem of his latest creation. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up . Ingrid says: When he was doing the hem, Prince Philip walked through the Queen’s dressing room and said ‘hmh, nice dress.apos.The Queen flushed scarlet. I always remember him telling me that story. She was just so thrilled to get the compliment from her husband. Mr Thomas, who owned his own couture business in Belgravia, London, made many outfits for the Queen and for other royal women too. In  he was awarded a Royal Warrant as dressmaker for his work.  The Queen is always perfectly dressed and her use of block colours and pretty pattern has worked for decades. But the same couldnapost be said for all the royals, as during the programme, one of the experts described Sarah Ferguson as the worst dresser of all time. Ingrid said: “The worst dresser of all time was definitely Fergie. She looked great in her own clothes, in jeans and t-shirts but she was just a disaster in the fashion of the s because it was just too much for her. It was too frilly, there were too many bows. She said so herself.” However, as sheaposs got older, Fergie learnt what suits her, and what doesnapost Emily Andrews said. She said: As an older woman now she has got her style absolutely on point. She’s got really good legs, she always wears dresses or pleated skirts, a top and a blazer and she’s got that lovely red hair.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Oliver Monaghan-White, , had completed his basic training as a navy sailor and had been preparing to become a chef on one of the Royal Navyaposs stealth nuclear submarines. He had been forced to go through computer-based training which he didnapost enjoy and during this time he had continued to rack up more than £, in gambling debts, the inquest in Winchester heard. Abigail Askwith, his partner told the inquest that Oliver had volunteered to go into submarines because of the extra pay he would have received and this, combined with his dficulty accepting authority, had made him unhappy. She said: Oliveraposs personality and who Oliver is does not line up with the Royal Navy and having people telling him what to do just annoyed him. He did not like to be told what to do, even with me. It was just who he was, he was stubborn. Oliver signed up for submarines when he first went into the Navy for money reasons and nothing . He realised that submarines would not be the best option considering how he struggled to be away from home. He wanted to be in the Royal Navy to see the world, in submarines you donapost see the world. He only signed up for the money. Hampshire Coroner Jason Pegg heard how Oliver, who was repeatedly described as a closed book emotionally, had been sent to the base at Worthy Down, near Winchester, Hampshire, to complete his Phase  training but that he had struggled with disciplinary issues.The aspiring chef had struggled with his attitude and adjusting to naval le but there were no outward signs of him being unhappy, the hearing was told. However, Abigail said Oliver, who lived in Darlington, County Durham, had expressed deep unhappiness and even said that he had tried to get himself thrown out of the Navy by acting up. Through tears, she said told the inquest: There was always a dferent reason why he wanted to moan about work. In March  before he came home I nearly got him to leave. He did have reasons to leave, he was still using inhalers which he should not have been. He was almost on the point of leaving but then he pulled back because he didnapost want to let anyone down. I said aposyou are not letting anyone down, you have tried it, you are not letting anyone downapos but he was worried that he would let his family down. Oliver would often say in a joking manner that he would kill himself, the inquest heard. However, those close to him did not take it seriously because of his dark sense of humour. The inquest that Oliver had accumulated large gambling debts and despite multiple loans from friends and family, he was not able to get on top of them.  His family also told the hearing that Oliver had continued to pay maintenance for his daughter from a previous relationship. However, he was struggling to get access to her and was considering legal action to assert his rights. The coroner was told that Oliver had been at his family home on May , , on leave, only days before his death and had been emotional about leaving. Abigail said: I packed his suitcase on Sunday morning -I donapost do things they donapost get done properly. He was sat on the bed and looked at me and said aposthis will be the last time you are going to see me.apos I thought he was just winding me up because I get upset when he goes back to the base, I thought nothing of it. I took the case downstairs and put it by the front door. Nicole was making us some sandwiches and I started talking to her. Then I noticed Oliver put something into the case, I asked what it was and he said it was nothing. But since we have been through and checked the cupboards and I believe what he put in the case was what he had used [the rope]. The couple had spoken on the phone the evening before he died as Abigail told the inquest that nothing seemed amiss and that she thought he was better than ever. After hanging up the phone, she sent Oliver a message saying: Goodnight, I love you. The message was never opened. On the morning of June , , Oliver was found by staff at the Worthy Down barracks hanged. The inquest heard that Oliver had been alone on his floor after he had been removed from his original class for disciplinary reasons.

A toxicological examination found no drugs or alcohol in his system. Oliveraposs isional officer Chief Petty Officer Thomas Dennison told the inquest he was a talented chef who the Navy felt would have offered a great deal to the service. Warrant Officer Ian McHugh told the coroner that had Oliver expressed his wish to leave the submarine service it would have been considered, but it would have been dficult because chefs were considered critical. The veteran sailor added that Oliver had committed to serving five years in the Royal Navy, something which his family believed might have made him feel trapped. Concluding the inquest Mr Pegg said: Oliver was a young man who rarely spoke about his feeling and he has been described as often being a closed book. When he started training at Worthy Down Oliver said he was not enjoying the Royal Navy but in a subsequent conversation he said he wanted to say in and give it a go. It is clear Oliver gave the impression of wanting to give it a go. He worked hard on his course and he had a good attitude. I am satisfied that when Olive place the lanyard around his neck he intended the outcome to be his death. Therefore the appropriate conclusion is suicide. Oliver took his own le and he intended to do so. Why he did what he did only Oliver will know. It seems to me that Oliver was a closed book and was a young man who seems to me to have had a bright future in the Royal Navy. He had a number of pressures, most signicant was the financial debts and the pressure associated with his former relationship and his child. *If youaposre struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open   on  .

The aircraft was spotted trying to land at Dublin Airport on Wednesday during Storm Dudley, with the plane skidding along the tarmac as it tried to get its wheels down. The pilot eventually managed to safely land the plane, but there were a number of similar incidents reported around the country as mph winds made taking off and landing dficult. On one Ryanair flight from London Stansted to Cork Airport, the pilot took three attempts to safely land the aircraft.On the second attempt, people were screaming as the plane was just meters off the ground, and then had to suddenly take off away from the runway again, reports CorkBeo. One passenger on board the flight, who hadnapost flown since before the pandemic, said that the plane was extremely shaky and that tensions started to get high as the pilot approached the airport for the second time.  We got so close to the ground and then suddenly started heading up into the air again, people were screaming, it was worrying at the time, the passenger said. We ended up back out over the sea and then on the third attempt we did actually land, but it was scary for a minute there, once the plane landed one person was sick as soon as they got off the flight, they added.The tricky weather conditions affected a number of flights on Wednesday. The strong gusts forced the plane carrying Manchester City aposs players and staff to ert to Liverpool after leaving Lisbon, with the aircraft forced to circle the airport a number of times before landing.Millions of Brits endured a fretful night as huge gusts of around mph battered parts of the UK, with amber warnings in place for central Scotland, Northern Ireland and in England.  Gusts of up to mph swept the Midlands as Storm Dudley blew across the country, leaving thousands without power in northern areas. Commuters looking to get to work this morning woke to find roads blocked by felled trees as well as nightmares of train lines as workers try to remove the devastation. People on social media shared pictures of damaged homes, crushed cars and power cuts. In the north of England, around , were left without power with thousands still waiting for the lights to be turned on.  A red weather warning - the highest alert, meaning a high impact is very likely - has been issued by the Met Office due to the combination of high tides, strong winds and storm surge.Forecasters said there is a risk of flying debris resulting in danger to le and damage to buildings and homes, with roofs blown off and power lines brought down. The warning covers the coastline of Devon, Cornwall and Somerset as well as the south coast of Wales and will be in effect from am until pm on Friday. All trains in Wales are suspended on Friday. Amber warnings, the second highest alert level, for wind are in place across the whole of England from am to pm on Friday, while yellow weather warnings, the next level down, for wind and snow are in force for a large part of Scotland - where blizzards are predicted - and the whole of Northern Ireland.

Pupils from Welholme Academy in Grimsby, and Kingston Primary School in Benfleet, broached subjects many adults would avoid – including askingblind people dream in colour. Vlogger Siobhan Meade, who is completely blind after losing her sight at aged , was in the hot seat, answering everything the little ones put to her and her guide dog Marty. Asked by one of the kidsshe could dream, she said: “I do dream and I dream in colour. “That means when I’m dreaming, I can see, which is really cool.”  The young children couldnapost hold back their excitement as they asked Siobhan how she knew where her dog had been for a poo – and just how does she pick it up  “Marty has a special pen where I can take him to go to the toilet, and I have a special command I have to give for him to go to the -- “But I donapost want to say it too loud because I donapost want him to go to the toilet in here. That wouldnapost be nice, would it ” Siobhan joked. The video comes after a survey, commissioned by Guide Dogs, found  percent of children want to know what a person who is blind or visually impaired sees when they dream.The study of , children aged six to , and their parents, revealed a host of other questions kids would like to know the answer to. These include “how much can you see ”and “how do you choose your clothes ” . Along with, “how do you recognise people ”and “do you understand what colours are ” . Despite their curiosity,  percent of parents polled said their little ones have never asked them about disabilities – such as being blind or visually impaired. And over half of youngstersadmitted they were worried about talking to people who are blind, or people with a visual impairment, about their disability. But  percent of parents polled, via OnePoll, agreed their kids spending more time with people of their age who have disabilities would lead to greater equality and less stigma.  Siobhan Meade said: “Those without disabilities are naturally curious about how those with disabilities live their lives – not just kids, but adults too. “However, adults are perhaps more likely to feel uneasy addressing people from the blind or visually impaired community, possibly due to limited interaction with people with those impairments. “This is why meeting the children is so important – it’s a really wonderful opportunity to shape perceptions in a positive and accurate way, and of course, introduce them to Guide Dog Marty.” Lisa Petrie, head of children and young people service development for Guide Dogs, added: “Vision impairment is a massively growing issue in the UK. “Every day  more people join the two million already living with sight loss, and this number is set to double by . “Guide Dogs is here to help people with sight loss live the le they choose. This is part of the motivation for us visiting the school. “We want to raise awareness and educate on the breadth and depth of our services, that go far beyond our beloved guide dogs. “We are working tirelessly to increase awareness of the work we do and the support we offer to the public, including young people.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationSchoolsDisabilityAnimalsGuide dogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Titan Airways flight took off from Lisbon at around .pm on Wednesday afternoon, Manchester Evening News reports.Data from FlightRadar shows the plane circled over Manchester three times before erting to Liverpool John Lennon Airport,  miles away. The plane was carrying the Manchester City first team back from Lisbon following their match against Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday.

Just when The Firm thought they had buried one of the most shameful and humiliating periods in its recent history, the Queen has been dealt another hammer blow. Scotland Yard launching a criminal probe into an alleged cash for honours scandal at the heart of one of Prince Charles’s charities is not just another extraordinary development in exceptional times. It may call into question the very fabric of those operating at the heart of the monarchy.  Once again, as she has done many times before in times of trouble, the Queen today summoned the strength to put on a brave face and put duty first. But one could not fail to be moved by her admission, walking stick in hand, that she was unable to move as she would wish while a dignitary was wheeled out for a photo-op at her Windsor home. Just as she should be preparing to revel in the glory of her remarkable  years on the throne, it seems as though events are imploding around her. The family had hoped the shame of Prince Andrew’s involvement with two convicted sex offenders would be finalised ahead of Her Majesty’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations this year. But questions will surely remain over the Queen’s judgment in helping her son make such a settlement to his sex abuse accuser, which largely remains shrouded in secrecy. All of this against a backdrop of another potential scandal, which may see her son Charles and grandson Prince Harry quizzed by police, albeit as witnesses in the first instance. If ever there was a time to unite and collectively take the strain, now is that time for the family. Whether they are too fractured to do so is a story to be continued.

The Mirror’s research shows the shocking depth of the social care crisisDon Hurst and Winnie in her current care homeByLucy ThorntonNews ReporterClaire Miller:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |comments Thousands of families face the trauma of seeing elderly loved ones kicked out of care homes amid a “tsunami” of providers closing.The number of private care givers handing back local authority contracts has more than tripled in  months, research by the Mirror has revealed.And NHS England data showed that % of hospital patients fit for discharge cannot leave because there is no social care in place for them.On an average day, , patients remained in hospital who no longer met the criteria to be there. And the problem was mainly down to elderly patients being unable to get care in their own home or a residential place.  The Mirror’s research shows the shocking depth of the social care crisis. In , there were  contracts for residential care and care in the community handed back, while in just  months last year the figure was ,. The ed care contracts last year left , vulnerable adults suffering distressing upheaval. Some families were given just  hours to find a new home. The figures, revealed after Freedom of Information requests from the Mirror, suggest  care contracts are being handed back by providers each week. And we reveal the human cost of care home turmoil, with one daughter telling how she found her mother, who had advanced dementia, sitting in the middle of her cold and dark new room, with her head in her hands crying.  And a husband in Liverpool told us how he was “terried” his we, who has Alzheimer’s, would be moved too far away for him to carry on his daily visits. Care home bosses blame the closures on staff shortages, Covid, and a lack of funding from local authorities. The Care Quality Commission said staff vacancies in care homes were up from % in April  to .% in December. Kate Terroni, of the CQC, said: “Staffing pressures are being felt across all health and care settings. More stability in social care is the key that will unlock improved access and quality for the people who use it – and it will also help ease pressure on the NHS, enabling more people to leave hospital in a timely way when they are medically fit to do so.”Health Secretary Sajid Javid is under intense pressure from the unions to step in. UNISON General Secretary Christina McAnea said: “Ministers must hear the clanging alarm bells and invest in social care. “These figures paint a horrying picture of a broken system. Every failed contract means sub-standard care for elderly, disabled and vulnerable people, and workers exploited with poverty wages and little or no sick pay. This has to stop.” Morgan Vine, of Independent Age, said: “We have been receiving a higher number of calls to our helpline from people in this situation. Increased care home closures illustrate just how much some care providers are struggling.”  Justin Russi, who runs care homes in County Durham and Teesside, said: “I got served at the checkout in the local supermarket by someone who used to be my senior carer. She was getting more money, doing less work, pushing someone’s shopping along a conveyor belt. “£. does not cut the mustard when you can go down to the local supermarket and get £ an hour. It’s a joke.” Nicola Richards, from Palms Row Health Care in Sheffield, had to close one of her three homes and warned of a “tsunami” of other closures to come across the UK. She said: “It’s heartbreaking to close a home. Care homes across the country have been in financial dficulty for a long time due to the current care system and a lack of government support.” Our research showed one area hit hard was Southend in Essex, where there were no care home closures at all in , then four in  and six in the first  months of . As of this month, just  remain open in the town. Essex County Council said: “Signicant pressures are being experienced nationwide. Essex is no exception.” From the  replies we received to our FoI requests, London councils were among those least likely to report having contracts handed back, with around half in the capital having none since . But the closures are having an impact on the NHS, data showing hospital bed occupancy at % and  trusts reporting occupancy above % last week.To operate safely, occupancy should be below % to cope with spikes. Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust declared a critical incident yesterday due to overwhelming demand. Miriam Deakin, of NHS Providers, said: “Delayed discharges continue to be an issue, highlighting pressures across the health and care system.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Care staff are working incredibly hard and we are doing everything we can to support them – including through a £. million recruitment fund and expanding the Health and Care Visa scheme to bolster the workforce. “Over the course of the pandemic, we have made available more than £. billion in specic funding for adult social care. “More than  million PCR and  million LFD kits have been delivered to care homes and we have invested a further £ million to support safe and timely hospital discharges to get patients into the best place for their care and support to continue.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON UnisonNHSCare Quality CommissionHospitalsCare homesMental healthNursing homesAlzheimers diseaseFluSupermarketsDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The small balls of tar were discovered on the coastline of seaside town Blackpool, Lancashire, sparking a major clean up operation. Their discovery comes after roughly  barrels of crude oil escaped from a pipe off the coast of North Wales, which supplies fuel to the Isle of Man. People have been urged not to touch the balls or attempt to remove them from the beach while clean up teams from oil firm ENI UK are sent in. A spokesman for the firm said: The clean-up teams are onsite and working closely with the local authorities and coastguard.  Pictures of the iconic beach have shown the small black balls strewn across the sand between the townaposs North and Central Piers. The burst pipe, which runs between two s named Conwy and Douglas, was shut off following the leak on Monday and remains closed. The coin-size pieces of tar are made up of a mixture of hydrocarbons and form when crude oil deposits are weathered after floating in the ocean. The local council said Storm Dudley is likely to see more balls wash up on the shore and has urged people not to touch or try to remove any of the balls. A spokesman for Blackpool Council said: Due to tidal conditions and a forecast of extreme weather conditions over the next few days, there is a possibility of more washing up.Our beaches will mostly be chained off due to high tides and storm force winds during this time, and we ask that people avoid these stretches to avoid any contact. Eni UK processes crude oil to produce fuels, lubricants and chemical products and is involved with offshore drilling in the UK.

We’re firmly in the pro-pun camp, evenit can prove a little in-tents. Here, UK Pun Champion Richard Pulsford, aka The Punball Wizard, takes an irreverent look at the major stories grabbing the headlines. UK politicsThe Conservative Party, sorry, The Conservative Work Event, continues to ride out the Partygate storm. The PM has shaken up the Downing Street operation by ensuring the garden, previously used for so many gatherings without being cleared up afterwards, is now covered by one huge canape. On a lunchtime visit to the Carlsberg factory, Boris Johnson offered to add lager to the journalists’ broth but the bosses insisted he couldn’t ruin a pea soup in a brewery. The PM gave Jacob Rees-Mogg the new role of “Minister for Brexit Opportunities and Government Efficiency”. Apparently he wasn’t allowed to become Secretary of State for the Environment as his name sounds too much like re-smog. The royals Prince Andrew has settled a civil sexual assault case brought against him in the US by Virginia Giuffre. The Duke and Ms Giuffre reached an out-of-court settlement and he will pay an undisclosed sum. Andrew had already lost his Royal titles and patronages but is going to keep the title “Duke of Hazard”.The Queen wants Camilla to take charge of organising her collection of sea shells when she dies and hopes people will see her as the Queen Conch Sort. The cost of living In our house we were worried we couldn’t afford our electricity bill, but instead of disconnecting us npower offered a simple solution, and now we’re de-lighted. Wine With news that just two glasses of wine are enough to bring you up to your daily sugar limit, I’d like to point out that I don’t drink high-end plonk. My wine rack is held together with cellar tape. Another wine-related thing I learned this week is that there is an EU body that oversees the fortying of drinks with German wine. It’s an add hock committee. Bones A human femur was found in the River Thames by Simon Hunt, who was taking his name rather too seriously. Experts say the bone is about , years old and belonged to a person who was about ft in tall. SoKeith Richards ever needs a new hip then archaeologists have something more modern they can offer him. Trees I read that more than eight million trees have been lost to storm damage this winter. At first I thought, “You can’t palm me off, I’m not falling fir that one”, until I realised it was true. Well wood you believe it  It’s not good, that’s plane to see. In fact it’s such a horror show they could make it into a Tim-ber-ton film. I once tried scanning a book of tree poems at the supermarket self-checkout but it didn’t like the bark ode. I guess it must have been an unexpected xylem in the bagging area. Some people have no regard for nature. Like the time I was visiting a graveyard in Paris and I saw a couple hang their raincoats on a tree. I thought, that’s mac arbre.

I have long black hair and itaposs very noticeable. Itaposs like in the span of two months a third of my hair suddenly turned white. It does not bother me in the slightest and I never wanted to cover it with dye because I actually like it. My boss is one of those people who inherited a company and only shows up at our workplace a few times a year, so I had not seen him since early . The two other times he was in the offices we didnapost coincide so this week was the first time he saw me in about a year. Without even saying hello he asked me, aposWhataposs wrong with your hair apos. I told him that since last summer my hair had started turning grey.

I work in an office space with  other people and I only interact with clients over the phone.  I do maintain my hygiene, my hair is clean and well kept and my grey hair doesnapost represent his brand for shit because not one of our clients has ever seen my face and I seriously doubt theyaposd care I have grey hair.

She added: The next day I arrived at work and HR, who is the owneraposs brother-in-law and has that title just to collect a paycheque, asks me why I havenapost coloured my hair yet after my talk with the boss. I told him, aposyou canapost be serious right apos, and I tried to explain how grey hair has nothing to do with hygiene or being professional.

Iaposm so sorry youaposre facing it. Fighting it takes so much energy. What a bizarre shock. While another added: So grey hair is unhygienic now for women  Your employer has no right to control your appearance. And a third posted: If you either walk out or are fired, it would be best to let the clients that you work with know that you will no longer be able to help them due to your hair not being coloured.

However, there are others out there who are a little bit more decadent with their water consumption. Ryan Dubs, who works as a Creative Director, spends more on bottled water in a year than many will spend on wine in their entire letime, splurging ,per month on bottled water. With four fridges in his kitchen, Ryan has plenty of room for his monthly luxury and finds loading the bottles onto his shelves to be a very satisfying activity.Ryanaposs aqua tipple of choice is VOSS, a high-end water brand that prides itself on having one of the purest bottled waters of anywhere on Earth.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. In a TikTok video that will leave any thrty shoppers wincing, Ryan can be seen packing away his pricey delivery, explaining that heaposs always been a water snob. Ryan - who goes by the username @ryandubs - said: I know what youaposre thinking, aposWhat the hell  Why do you care  Itaposs just water apos But I hate the taste of tap water. I cannot drink it. I can only drink bottled water, itaposs the only way Iaposll get it in me. Previously, Ryan would get equally enormous quantities of Fiji water delivered, but began to feel conscious about how much plastic waste he was creating, and wanted to try a more eco-friendly choice. Ryan explained: Voss is net carbon neutral so itaposs definitely a more eco-friendly choice. And yeah, itaposs a little pricey but I do buy it in bulk from the same type of place that would sell it to a hotel or a grocery store, so itaposs a bit better. Despite the staggering cost, Ryan appears to have no regrets about his spending. Reasoning that everyone has their thing, and claiming that his house guests just love being handed a nice, cold glass water bottle. However, as pleasant as that may be, many of those in the comments section have been left aghast at the extravagance of the monthly purchase, believing no water could possibly be that refreshing. Remarking on the privilege of having access to clean water in the first place, one person commented: People donapost have clean water or any water at all, and this guy out here saying, aposI hate the taste of tap water, I canapost get it in meapos.

The discovery has been deemed so important that boffins now want to expand the station to include a new biology lab to collect, process and analyse microbes in space without having to ship them back to Earth.Scientists have been surveying the craft - launched in , run by five international space agencies and manned by inter-changing crews of seven astronauts - for the presence of microorganisms for at least six years.  NASA scientists Dr Nitin Kumar Singh and Dr Kasthuri Venkateswaran said the newly-found strains might be a game-changer for the future of space crops. They said it was essential to find new bacteria that assist in plant growth under stressful conditions in extreme places with scarce resources. Researchers think the new bacteria could help with the eventual colonisation of Mars as their characteristics include helping vegetation grow.Meanwhile, NASA is considering whether to kill off the International Space Station by crashing it into the ocean within the next ten years.

Marie Unicorn, who works as a medical secretary says she soon began to feel aposmore herapos as people started commenting that she even looked like a unicorn. This convinced the -year-old to take the plunge and fill in forms to legally change her name. At the time, her plumber hubby Patrick Naisbitt, , jokingly askedshe was having a midle crisis, but fully supported her and told her to aposdo whatever makes you happyapos. Three years on Marie Unicorn [this is her first name] hasnapost looked back, and now daughters Elouise, , and -year-old Esme have even taken on the Sparkles moniker too. Despite being fully supportive of Marie Unicorn ditching her married surname, Patrick has said he wonapost be changing his, with his we joking aposheaposs a boreapos.  While the family loves the new name, not everyone has been so sure about it - with some others unable to believe itaposs real. After splashing out £ to get her name changed by deed poll, Marie Unicorn contacted all companies and utility providers to update her details from Marie Naisbitt to Marie Unicorn Sparkles. The majority have been plain sailing, with her driving licence, bank cards, finance information and work ID proving an easy transition. But poor Patrick spent  minutes on the phone trying to convince a bemused car insurance provider that the name change wasnapost a wind-up. Marie Unicorn, from Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, explained: My driving licence has been super easy to change, everything  has been really easy too. We had a couple of issues with the car insurance, my husband changed it over because I was already listed as a named driver. He was on the phone for  minutes and he was arguing with the bloke because he was going aposno, behave, tell me reallyapos and this went on for a while. It got really awkward, my husband was saying aposno seriously, check the driving licenceapos. We got it sorted at the finish. Everythingaposs been changed now, Iaposm just waiting for my passport to arrive but the name change has been done.  Marie Unicorn continued to say: I changed my name as I just wanted to be myself. I had a business called the Unicorn Beauty Club and people used to call me aposthe unicorn ladyapos because Iaposm obsessed with them. Iaposve always loved unicorns. It always annoys me the thought that giraffes and owls exist but a unicorn couldnapost. I used to collect unicorn things when I was younger, it just sort of got out of control when I got older. I love that they can be themselves and theyaposre so magical. She went on to share how watching Marie Kondo while going through a bout of depression spurred her on to make changes in her le.  I went through quite a bad depression in  and I just didnapost feel like me. I wasnapost happy so I decided to start making changes, she said. I saw Marie Kondo and she sayssomething doesnapost spark joy, throw it out. Thataposs what really inspired me and I started looking at my clothes and hair and thinking aposI donapost like any of itapos. I was wearing dark clothes and had straight black hair trying to look all sensible because Iaposm a mum but I wasnapost being me. I started making little changes and thataposs where it spiralled. Marie Kondo hasnapost just changed my wardrobe but my entire le, that one quote changed everything and has moulded the way I am now. My style before I changed was very mumsy. Iaposve just bought a big pink shiny coat, I wouldnapost have dreamed of wearing anything like this before. When I started dyeing my hair I started to think aposIaposm starting to feel more meapos. Then people said aposyou really do look like a unicorn nowapos and thataposs when I thought aposIaposm going to do itapos [do the name change]. Itaposs been a few years now since the mum made the change and she says she now couldnapost ever imagine changing her name back. Iaposll keep it for the rest of my le, she proclaimed.

Photos show the boy wedged against the side and is unable to move his arms and upper body. Video shared on social media, including by officials of Afghanistanaposs new Taliban government, shows the tearful little boy talking to his father.The dad is heard saying: Are you OK, my son  Talk with me and donapost cry, we are working to get you out. OK, Iaposll keep talking, the boy replies calmly.  The video was obtained by rescuers who lowered a camera down the narrow well by rope. Abdullah Azzam, secretary to Deputy Prime Minister, tweeted: A team is there with an ambulance, oxygen and other necessary things. A trench has been dug so workers can reach the boy, and the rescue looks similar to how the attempt to rescue little Rayan was carried out in Morocco.A second video has shown rescuers lowering food and drink down to the boy, and he appears to be eating and drinking. Freelance writer Sebghatullah Sadid in Afghanistan tweeted to say Haidaraposs health condition is reported as well by medics.

Amongst these is Beinn Odhar # its southern slopes lying firmly in the county of Stirling, whilst its summit stands proudly in Argyll.If approached from the west, north or south you could keep your toes in Argyll all day. Unless on a round of Corbetts # there are five here that make a fine challenge # it is easier to approach the Corbett via its gentler slopes from Tyndrum. This also gives the opportunity to explore the adit # access tunnel # and old lead mine on its higher slopes where the mineral vein continuation from Sron nan Colan is exposed. The Beinn Odhar lead mining venture appears to have been a short one but the views once the summit is reached are tremendous.Leaving the car park, cross the A and head left passing the Tyndrum Inn, the Green Welly Stop and cross the bridge.Turn right immediately after crossing the bridge to join the West Highland Waynorthwards, passing the KeyStore.You will need to stay on the WHW for the next .km as it slowly climbs out of Tyndrum with the A on your left and the Crom Allton your right until you reach the bridges over the burn and railway.Cross the bridges and go through the gate at the north end. You will be heading up on to the open hillside to your right.You now have a choice. Either head straight up in a north easterly direction picking your own route on the grassy slopes or veer slightly right back to the Crom Allt to pick up a faint path. If you use the latter, ensure you head upwards at around NN. Either way you will tend to end up on sections of the old mining path as it zigs zags upwards by default due to the natural line of the slope.Once you reach m # after approximately .km depending on how direct your route was # the ground becomes stonier. The adit and mine are higher to your left, northwest, on the crest of the ridgeline, whereas the faint path runs just under this soyou want to explore them it is worth scrabbling up the rocks to have a look. The bottom of the adit starts at around ms.Heading up from the adit and mine # or path # the route flattens out, passing a lochan and the county boundary to your left. Ahead, the final ascent is best tackled by heading northeast then northwest to follow the hill’s natural line. There are no particular dficulties.The summit views are fabulous and an excellent panorama of Beinn Dorain can be had from the steep northern slopes above Coire Luaidh.It is easiest todown the southwestern slopes you ascended, but other possibilities could include some of the neighbouring Corbetts, especially the longer days in summer.Safety in the outdoorsThe described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print,  please be aware track and path closures can happen at any time.

to celebrate the monarch’s platinum jubilee year.Also known as the Age of Reason, the Enlightenment was an intellectual movement beginning in the early s that championed science, progress, tolerance

take  years for the saplings to grow to a height to recreate the avenue’s former grandeur.At Tredegar House, just outside Newport in Wales, gardeners will be adding new oak trees to its last surviving avenue.Once the house stood at the centre of a number of dferent avenues that radiated outwards along the lines of the compass and some of its last surviving trees are thought to be more than  years

firm to claim three precious league points.A healthy crowd of almost  turned out in dreadful conditions, with gusts topping  miles per hour and intermittent sheets of freezing rain greeting those spectators who arrived to support the team.Refreshingly, though, a group of youngsters were amongst the entourage travelling with the north Glasgow visitors, and they soon felt at home, happily mixing with the Pupils# own young supporters and joining in song.First, an attempted Pupils clearance found its way to Finnart#s number , who kept his composure to slot home a close-range finish and make it two goals in two games against the Pupils.Then, a header from a swirling cross from Finnart#s left-hand side couldn#t be kept out, despite the efforts of Alasdair Ferguson in goal.The Pupils# Rhys Casci did go close with a one-on-one effort in the first half after being freed by a low pass from midfield, but the Tarbert-based player opted to shoot early and the keeper got his body in front of the effort and gathered at the second attempt.After the interval, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils hoped to use the westerly tailwind to put pressure on the visitors# goal, but it was a quieter half than the hosts would have liked.Finnart battled to repel the Pupils, limiting them to two dangerous efforts from outside the box, first from Casci who forced a save from the away keeper to tip his low shot round the post for a corner, and then from Scott Souden whose deflected effort forced the keeper into a save.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils made some changes late on with youngster Andrew Renton and right-back Michael McKinlay making afrom injury, but it wasn’t enough to turn the tide of the game and the visitors took all three points, to leave themselves two points behind leaders Kilsyth Athletic with two games in hand.Conversely, the Pupils are three points adrt at the foot of the ision, but importantly have two games in hand themselves.In the aftermath of the game, the Pupils# management team stated they were satisfied with the effort and performance level of the squad, acknowledging that the dference between the sides on the day, despite the polar dference in league positions, was the conversion of chances.This is something which Finnart has made an art form of in winning games against sides around them who perhaps play more expansive football.Sure enough,

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season.

to a Transport Scotland Aviation Strategy Consultation.They say air connectivity is essential for leline services and supporting the economy of the Highlands and Islands and believe there are excellent opportunities for aviation to deliver improved sustainable low carbon connectivity – with the right investment and governance.To that end, they look forward to engaging collaboratively with Transport Scotland, local authorities and air operators to develop an ambitious aviation strategy for Scotland.In a covering letter to their response, Councillor Henderson and Mr Lyon said: #Air links form an essential, often leline, element of the transport network in the Highlands and Islands.#All domestic air services either depart or land at an airport in the Highlands and Islands.#They provide these locations with the only air connectivity that enables these areas to compete economically with other regions of Scotland.#The services also often provide access to essential services such as health and education as well as the means by which many centrally located services are delivered to these islands and remote communities.#They say sustained investment is required from the Scottish Government to achieve both the ambitious transition to net zero and fully realise the opportunities that transition can provide through improved connectivity and benefits to local supply chains.Particular investment is needed to support the development of these new technologies and the associated infrastructure required to support them, they claim.The letter adds: #HITRANS and HIAL welcome a collaborative objective-led review of all current support mechanisms including PSOs and the Air Discount Scheme but also all wider funding and infrastructure.#The starting point of this review should be to establish a minimum level of service to ensure the connectivity needed to support sustainable local economies and a fairer and more just Scotland.#Surface transport to all UK airports is currently founded on models which incentivise private car use – be it a reliance on car parking revenue at airports or the promotion of fly and drive over public transport by airlines.#Again, an extensive overhaul of existing policy and regulation is requiredwe are to meet net zero targets and deliver against the sustainable travel hierarchy within the National Transport Strategy.#Councillor Henderson and Mr Lyon added that stakeholders and businesses in the Highlands and Islands had repeatedly highlighted the importance of securing guaranteed access to international

This isn’t a natural climate disaster but one largely of political making.“Action should be taken by both the UK and Scottish Governments to protect the poorest and mitigate hardship for all. Windfall taxes, VAT reduction and direct payments to the poorest and most threatened households are required. It confirms why Scotland must be in charge of its own energy policy and the natural wealth of its shores.”  Frazer Scott, CEO of Energy Action Scotland, said of the rise: “The energy price rises announced this month are absolutely devastating for households across Scotland.“It impacts most on those households in the lowest incomes, who spend a signicantly higher proportion of their incomes to heat and power their homes – or indeed simply cannot heat and power their homes to the comfort levels that maintain health and wellbeing.“These households will be unable to afford an adequate level of thermal comfort to maintain their health and wellbeing, and people will be forced to choose between heating and eating.“There are important short and long term priorities.“We are absolutely in a crisis and there needs to be a crisis response.“As it stands, the quantum of support provided by UK Government to Scottish Government is simply inadequate.“This payment appears to be better targeted to the households most in need compared to England but in Scotland this will provide little comfort to the , Scottish households in extreme fuel poverty, facing declining health and wellbeing, and excess deaths attributable to fuel poverty.”  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: “The East Lothian Poverty Plan adopted by the council in October  highlighted fuel poverty as a major and growing concern. It identied measures to be put in place to continue the work to combat fuel poverty and support people facing rising fuel costs.“The council has already increased its Scottish Welfare Fund budget by £, to increase support provided in crisis grants and a new Fuel Poverty Fund to help people in financial dficulty and facing hardship due to rising fuel costs.“We are aware that the predicted rise in fuel costs is a serious concern for East Lothian residents, so we will continue to monitor the situation and promote the financial advice and support available from the council and other agencies, including Changeworks, as well as working together with partners on any possible further interventions to support our residents.“This includes continuing our work to ensure that council homes are as energy efficient as possible while supporting landlords, tenants and homeowners to do the same by signposting to appropriate advice and support from partner agencies.“The new East Lothian Poverty Partnership set up by East Lothian Council is due to hold its first meeting next month, bringing together public sector agencies, voluntary organisations and community groups to combine efforts to

The recipe is for Dracula Salad and was her memorial to her late husband, Cruden Bay and his famous book.Also seen as an important Scottish link to the novel Dracula is the influence of Scottish writer Emily Gerard on Bram Stoker’s placing the plot in Transylvania.The Jedburgh-born author wrote a book about Transylvanian superstitions, which played a crucial role in Bram Stokers research when writing his classic novel.Scotlands capital also plays a part as the publishing house of Dracula was founded by Edinburgh bookseller and stationer Archibald Constable.Occultist and author JW Brodie-Innes, a leading member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawns Amen-Ra Temple in Edinburgh has been a personal friend.In his supernatural horror novel The Devils Mistress - first published in , three years after Bram Stoker died - he paid tribute to the Dracula author in a special dedication in his book.It says: \"To the memory of my dear friend, the author of Dracula, to whose help and encouragement I owe more than I am at present at liberty to state\".Dacre Stoker says he is now investigating what that \"more\" actually was.Sherlock Holmes author Arthur Conan Doyle, who was a spirtualist, also features in Bram Stoker story as a friend. He was at the Edinburgh authors marriage on  September .When Bram Stoker managed The Lyceum Theatre in London, he produced the Conan Doyle play A Story of Waterloo.In one letter Conan Doyle said that he had enjoyed reading Dracula adding: \"I think it is the very best story of Diablerie which I have read in many years.\"Dacre Stoker said: \"Both of these guys obviously were interested in the occult and Conan Doyle recognised that.\"Bram Stokers career as a theatre manager, also saw him heavily involved in the opening night of the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh in .The Glasgow connection comes as Bram Stoker got the job to support the staging of plays at the Theatre Royal.There is a theory that name of RM Renfield, the fictional character that is unquestionably loyal to the vampire in the Dracula novel, was taken from Glasgows Renfield Street.A Visit Scotland source said of the trail: \"It will be something we will work with Dacre on, to look at related sites for a potential trail and how accessible they are for visitors, for instance,they are open to the public, and what the visitor experience would beadded to a self guided trail.\"An Experience Transylvania spokeswoman added: \"The intentions of the Scottish trail are to follow all existing and relevant Dracula connections in the region, including of course Cruden Bay.\"The trail could also take in the Aberdeenshire former fishing village of Collieston, where a shipwreck of a th Century Spanish galleon is said to have provided the inspiration for Bram Stokers second novel, The Mystery of the Sea.Further around the coast at Whinnyfold, Bram Stoker wrote his book, Lair of the White Worm.The Aberdeenshire village of Gardenstown is where the author stayed in  and could have finished writing Dracula which was published a year later.Dacre Stoker said: “Scotland is where many chapters of the novel Dracula were actually written. It was during his long walks along the beach of Cruden Bay and on to Whinnyfold where all of Bram’s earlier inspiration, notes and research came together. This area offered him peace and quiet, a far cry from the interruptions and the stresses of his office in the Lyceum Theatre in London.\"Many ask how come we don’t celebrate in Transylvania, Whitby or Dublin. All these other locations do play a role in the origins of Dracula, of course, but when it comes to celebrating the literary process - the process of a writer bringing the story to le - I think Scotland, is a given”.Jenni Steele, film and creative industries manager for VisitScotland said of the th anniversary event: “This is a fantastic opportunity for people to learn about the Scottish connections to this well-loved novel. Dracula holds such a sense of intrigue and mystery, and it’s easy to see why Bram Stoker was inspired by some of Scotland’s magical landscapes and locations on his travels – not to mention the fascinating connections he had with many other Scottish writers and personalities.\""},{"url":null,"title":"letters-many-scotland-hold-nicola-sturgeon-contempt","story":"Once again we have the blinkered attitude of an SNP supporter spouting the nonsense that everyone in Scotland supports them and their endless independence distraction.

She would find those who hold in contempt a First Minister who has spent £ million on overseas offices and countless sums on Gaelic signage and gender identity issues while her own constituency has homeless on the streets and her Health Secretary is complaining about lack of future funding for Covid tests and ambulances who considers it important to tell us all her views on a footballer’s treatment of his cat, and the weather forecast, while saying nothing about long-overdue ferries, failed airports and unfit roads who leads a party which wanted to close down freeports which would benefit thousands, simply because they are an idea which originated in Westminster who panders to a tiny green minority in preventing oil and gas exploration which would provide a much-needed boost to jobs and the economy and who values \"selfies\" at every opportunity rather than addressing real issues.In seeking a leader to be held in contempt, one need look no further than Nicola Sturgeon and her endless grievance-ridden agenda, refusing ever to take responsibility and always blaming someone .Steph Johnson, Glasgow.LOOK TO THE BIGGER PICTUREIT appears that Neil Mackaysees the achievement of independence being conditional upon the campaign being led by those who share his narrow political view. In other words, I would suggest, he is an anti-democrat. I am sure that the vast majority of Yes supporters, like me, want independence because of a fundamental belief that a small country should be governed by its own people not by the big country next door. The wider political and economic bent of the party leading the movement is completely irrelevant.Once independence has been won, a new set of Scottish political parties will evolve – a right of centre party , a left of centre partyand a range of minor parties. The SNP will wither away, its principalcompleted. Then the Scottish people will elect governments that reflect their social and economic beliefs, all of which are currently secondary to the demand for self-determination.Eric Begbie, Stirling.ALL IN THE NAME OF INDEPENDENCENEIL Mackay says once more he is in favour of Scottish independence but doesnt like the SNP. I joined the SNP as a socialist knowing that it was not as left as I would like. Many of the members I met were natural Conservatives or Liberal, but we were all in it together for the sake of Scotlands future.Over the years I contested council seats and parliamentary seats, I climbed thousands of stairs and spoke to thousands of people at their doors. I walked the streets with leaflets, I spoke at open-air rallies and at large indoor assemblies. I helped to organise jumble sales, dances, socials and quiz nights to raise a few pounds for the party.Many a time I stood in cold or rain outside election stations to welcome voters. And all for the sake of what Mr Mackay wants – independence.As a national newspaper journalist for nearly  years I know how easy it is to sit by the typewriter and sort out the world. Yes, it is hard, Mr Mackay, working the doors but, some of us have to do it.George MacDougall, Edinburgh.* NEIL Mackay is a much younger man than me but his excellent column today indicates that his support for independence has arisen from a very similar political journey to my own. Like him, I dont hate the SNP but view independence as an essential democratic goal for our Scottish nation, including those who do hate the SNP.I am often asked why I want to be separated from the English. I always reply that I dont want to be separated from our neighbours in England any more than from my neighbours here in Milngavie but I dont want either our nation or my home to be controlled by the neighbours. Like Mr Mackay I am not a nationalist or a flag-waver and do not think my nation is better than any other, but my nationality is Scottish and I would be happy to fly the EU flag alongside the Saltire.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.LEARNING TO WALK TALL IN THE WORLDNEIL Mackay unwittingly but helpfully demonstrates the internalised cringe of the underdog. His relationship with independence and the SNP is like his relationship with America: \"I love America – I just don’t like long-haul flights.” But independence is a long-haul flight, the route may deviate and the first destination may well not fit Mr Mackay’s vision of it. Independence means dealing with that reshaping it working it out.Scotland’s  years of entanglement with the Union has laid down layers of dependency. Many quail at the task of independence. Others can’t face it. But, to quote the Irish economist David McWilliams, \"independence is how a nation grows up. It’s how you walk tall in the world – as a sovereign nation that deals with its own problems, figures things out. If things go wrong that’s your fault. You create a vision and put together the structure to achieve that vision. You back yourselves to work it out.\"Mr Mackay has not lost faith in independence just the SNP. That’s fine.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig.* NEIL Mackays article was so spot on I wish I had written it myself. I too was a supporter of the SNP for a while, as it seemed at the time, around  years ago, that it could do no worse than Scottish Labour. Dearie me, how mistaken can one possibly be Rick Lawrie, Aberdour.NOTHING MAJOR HAS CHANGEDFROM reading the papers over the last few weeks, it would appear that there is an independence campaign well under way, with extensive coverage of pension provision, companies talking about leaving again and analysis of our economic position. We have even had SNP politicians going off to the Ukraine for an expensive photo opportunity to emphasise their international reputation, asanyone was taken in by that.Back in , the Scottish Government at least had the good manners to announce that a campaign was under way, and gave us a date. No such niceties this time. It seems like the argument is going to be instigated before any plan is in place.The interesting feature in all this is that nothing signicant has changed since . Back then, the Yes campaign lost the referendum because it did not have a compelling economic case. Despite having seven years to recty this, there are no proposals to address this at all. The truth, of course, is that the economic argument is a strength of the Union, and there is nothing that the SNP can do about that. So, having no plan, we have irritating arguments, enough to ert attention from other important issues, but nothing of substance, which even their own supporters can see. Can Nicola Sturgeon not just admit that this is not going to happen, dficult for her as that might be Victor Clements, Aberfeldy.THE LIBDEM VIEW ON EUROPEIN the interests of accuracy I feel obliged to point out a signicant error on the part of your correspondent, Fraser Grant , on where dferent parties stand in relation to Europe.The Liberal Democrat position on Europe was indicated in your paper at the weekend by its Scottish leader, Alex Cole-Hamilton, , where he states quite clearly his belief that “the UK’s future is at the heart of Europe”.This as I understand it is also the Liberal Democrat position UK-wide.

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645020787354.jpg--covid_19___wed_16th_february_figures.jpg?1645020787000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220216newscovid 19 wed 16th february figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows five further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign. We have never received so many applications. It really goes to show how many people are attracted to a le at sea with a company like Stena Line. Now our HR team has the challenge of how to sort and interview so many applicants, but that is a nice challenge to have. Thank you to every single person that has applied to work with us.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645108869381.jpg--covid_19___thu_17th_february_figures.jpg?1645108870000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220217newscovid 19 thu 17th february figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows one further coronavirus related death and , new positive test results.

Where that doesn’t exist, it’s very hard to see how a merger would be successful”.“That’s why it’s vital community discussions are enabled, and they need to be enabled before any action plans are put in place, otherwise those action plans will not be workable,” she said.“Big decisions need to be taken by managing authorities, but we want to make sure parents and communities are listened to before they are made.”Related topicsUniversity of UlsterMore On University of Ulster PremiumNorthern Ireland’s rural property prices rise, but values in Derry slump by £kNI university staff begin -day strike action over pay and ‘brutal’ pension cuts Premium‘I’ve become a sobriety coach... and I really could have done with one in the past myself’ PremiumStudent numbers drop at Magee despite countless commitments to expandUlster University and Queen’s make their Sigerson Cup exitMost ReadMotorist lucky to be alive after tree falls on his car during Storm DudleyAlliance councillor Michael Long apologises over ‘clumsily worded’ Bloody Friday tweetStorm Eunice: Met Office updates wind and snow warning as second storm in a week set to hit Northern IrelandMeet the Kilkenny teen who has set up his own party to secure the unication of Ireland under British ruleSinn Fein taking Justice Minister post following next election ‘very dficult’ for unionists, claims Arlene FosterTop VideosPlayMet Office warns of #danger to le# in parts of England during Storm Eunice \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlayVideo: The worst Irish accents in film history - Pierce Brosnan as ‘Taffin’ in Taffin Latest EducationHalf-term holidays in Northern Ireland: A guide to the best family fun daysTeachers ‘ready to strike’ after rejecting pay offerSchool leaders ‘don’t have guidance and are having to make decisions in the dark’ after curb removalsDebate on issue of integrated education has never been higher, says campaignerMLAs back Bill to defer school starting age for some children from four to fiveLatestBrad Pitt sues Angelina Jolie for selling vineyard stake to Russian oligarch‘At its core, opera is just another way to tell a story... and to connect human to human’Fionola MeredithOpinionWhy a convicted sex offender should not be in the NI squadGraham Spencer and Rev Chris HudsonOpinionUnionism has to stop believing it can get to a new place by staying in an old placeTUV opposes birthday flag plan,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I have read what JCVI published.“I genuinely don’t know what I would domy children were that age. I would think very carefully. If my children were in the older age group, I would talk with them. I would also maybe have a talk with my GP and with other parents.“I was in support of the older children being vaccinated. The JCVI advice is not one way or the other.“Parents should be allowed make the decision that’s right — they shouldn’t be pilloried, they shouldn’t be attacked.”“I don’t envy parents making this decision.”While Ms Yiasouma said parents could speak to their family doctor about the issue, there are also concerns this could lead to a spike in telephone calls to already overstretched GPs.Dr Ultan Power, a professor of molecular virology at Queen’s University, said much more work is required to ensure parents can make an informed decision.“I think this is something that should be done by the Department of Health or Public Health Agencyso that parents have somewhere to go to have their questions answered,” he said.Dr Jillian Johnston, Joint Interim Assistant Director in Health Protection at the PHA, last night offered reassurances to parents, although she did not provide evidence there will be no long-term harm caused by the vaccines.“There is no evidence that the vaccine will lead to problems later in le,” she said.“As with any medicine, these vaccines are highly regulated products.“The Covid- vaccines are safe and effective and will give the best protection against coronavirus.”She continued: “The Covid- vaccine is being offered to all children aged five to  years in order to protect against severe disease and increase the immunity of vaccinated people against Covid- in advance of a potential future wave of Covid-.“While most children aged between five and  will have mild disease following infection from Covid-, some may experience symptoms which last longer than just a few days. Vaccination of children in this age group may also prevent a small number of hospitalisations and intensive care admissions, and would provide short-term protection against non-severe infection.“The impact of vaccination on future waves of Covid- is still unknown as it will depend on the characteristics of any new iants that emerge, for example timing, size and severity of infection.“While it is yet to be understood what the impact of vaccination in this age group will be on rates of infection as a whole, it is likely to provide short-term protection against illness and reduce the number of iniduals that may require admission to hospital.”Dr Johnston said the vaccines will reduce the risk of children developing paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome .The condition can happen in some children and young people after they have had Covid- and some youngsters have already received intensive care treatment after developing PIMS.Dr Johnston explained: “The condition is a delayed reaction to the body trying to overcome the virus, and this causes swelling throughout the body.“Receiving a Covid- vaccine will help to protect children against the likelihood of developing PIMS and long Covid.“If we see a future severe wave of Covid- infection, the vaccination programme could help to prevent  hospitalisations for PIMS for every million vaccine courses delivered.”She also said children who have already had a Covid- infection will be further protectedthey are vaccinated.“While having had the virus may give you some immunity, being fully vaccinated can offer you the best protection from the virus and severe disease,” she said. “Evenyou’ve already had Covid-, you could still get it again. The vaccine will reduce your risk of another infection and the severity of symptoms.”Related topicsDepartment of HealthMore On Department of Health PremiumMark BainOpinionCovid vaccination and children: An informed choice would be more welcome than a shot in the darkPublic inquiry in NI is vital for bereaved families, says solicitor PremiumSchool leaders ‘don’t have guidance and are having to make decisions in the dark’ after curb removalsHealth service dealt blow as budget cannot be introduced due to Stormont crisisBusinesses annoyed work from home guidance remainsMost ReadMotorist lucky to be alive after tree falls on his car during Storm DudleyAlliance councillor Michael Long apologises over ‘clumsily worded’ Bloody Friday tweetStorm Eunice: Met Office updates wind and snow warning as second storm in a week set to hit Northern IrelandMeet the Kilkenny teen who has set up his own party to secure the unication of Ireland under British ruleSinn Fein taking Justice Minister post following next election ‘very dficult’ for unionists, claims Arlene FosterTop VideosPlayMet Office warns of #danger to le# in parts of England during Storm Eunice \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlayVideo: The worst Irish accents in film history - Pierce Brosnan as ‘Taffin’ in Taffin Latest Northern IrelandThousands without power as Storm Eunice batters IrelandBids for extra funding for Northern Ireland road repairs hit -year lowTUV opposes move by NI council not to fly Union flag on Prince Andrew#s birthdaySt John Ambulance’s top cadet set for dinner with the QueenMost drivers admit using mobile phones while behind wheelLatestThousands without power as Storm Eunice batters IrelandNatWest s to profit after heavy Covid hitsBrad Pitt sues Angelina Jolie for selling vineyard stake to Russian oligarchBids for extra funding for Northern Ireland road repairs hit -year low‘At its core, opera is just another way to tell a story... and to connect human to human’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Tristan Morrow.Niamh CampbellTwitterEmailFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA young Kilkenny unionist has revealed that he and his family were forced to move to Northern Ireland after receiving IRA death threats.Tristan Morrowhas made headlines for creating the Irish Unionist Party . He believes the island of Ireland as a whole should become part of the UK – and in turn, separated from the EU – due to what he sees as universal economic benefits for all nations involved.The idea for his new political movement stemmed from his research of past, archetypal Irish unionists.“I then came in contact with a man from Co Clare with similar views to me,” he told the Belfast .“Quickly, we got a big group of southern people who have unionist views. Somebody said that we should start a movement over this and we thought it was a pretty good idea. We started it within the last year, maybe the year before, and we took it quite seriously.“At the moment, we haven’t been having or going to events, but so far we have  members and we should be getting a whole lot more in the coming weeks due to a new contact with the Donegal Orange Lodge. There’s massive interest in it.”But Mr Morrow’s views have led to stress and abuse towards him and other members of his group.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up He added: “One of our members got sent a picture of a revolver gun and the guy said he knew where he lived and actually mentioned his house address. We quickly got that sorted by reporting it.“I have received some real-le threats from local republicans. I’m out in the countryside and whenever I’m on my walk into town and back home, I’ve had a car stop in the middle of the road and just rev at me for a good  seconds, and as they’ve driven past they#ve shouted ‘tiocfaidh ar lá’.“I#ve had to live up here in Northern Ireland for a few years now, due to my family having to move away from Kilkenny because of the IRA. I believe it was the Co Laois IRA that had decided they had enough of my family and they gave us a week to move, otherwise they#d kill us all.”Raised on a Kilkenny farm, Mr Morrow said his family is still supportive of him.“My father had saidI was going fully public about my views, that he would stand with me,” he added.He also believes the whole of Ireland should have a referendum to determine whether it would want to join or leave the UK.“In my perfect scenario, I would imagine Ireland taking part within the union sort of like how Scotland does. A united Ireland would be beneficial for both sides, but also I would like us to be united with the English economically and as one nation. I don’t see how we could not benefit from it.“And it sort of seems that the only reason people don’t want it is over tribalism. Sort of like, ‘they’re English, we don’t want to be united with the English’.”He also noted that while some members of the IUP want to remain within the EU, he would like to see Ireland follow a Brexit-like referendum.“The majority of us would like to see us out of the EU and to have more uptake into the actual world stage of economic trade, especially with the Commonwealth.“We#ve had a lot of new converts to unionism who have literally no background with it. But due to what happened in  [the financial crash], a lot of them have become outright unionists.”Mr Morrow spoke of one man from Limerick, who he said took him around dilapidated streets in the city which were once thriving with shops and businesses, but are now “rotting away”.“He was talking about how after  years, this is what all that has won us - just nothing.”Mr Morrow said that he looks “forward to what the future holds” and has welcomed the support of some like-minded unionists from Northern Ireland, including independent politicians and members of the UUP.On Wednesday, he tweeted: “Irish Unionism will be normalised in due time.If Ireland is to be united, it will only be possible through unionism heading the charge.I will always be a Kilkenny man, my family loves Kilkenny and I will never give up on my hometown.After facing some online backlash for the post, Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie replied: “Stay safe Tristan. Nobody deserves threats for having a political view.”Most ReadMotorist lucky to be alive after tree falls on his car during Storm DudleyAlliance councillor Michael Long apologises over ‘clumsily worded’ Bloody Friday tweetStorm Eunice: Met Office updates wind and snow warning as second storm in a week set to hit Northern IrelandMeet the Kilkenny teen who has set up his own party to secure the unication of Ireland under British ruleSinn Fein taking Justice Minister post following next election ‘very dficult’ for unionists, claims Arlene FosterTop VideosPlayMet Office warns of #danger to le# in parts of England during Storm Eunice \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlayVideo: The worst Irish accents in film history - Pierce Brosnan as ‘Taffin’ in Taffin Latest Northern IrelandTUV opposes birthday flag planBids for extra roads cash hit a -year lowSt John Ambulance’s top cadet set for dinner with the QueenMost drivers admit using mobile phones while behind wheelDrink driver who left dying cyclistunconscious in field jailed and bannedLatestNatWest s to profit after heavy Covid hitsBrad Pitt sues Angelina Jolie for selling vineyard stake to Russian oligarch‘At its core, opera is just another way to tell a story... and to connect human to human’Fionola MeredithOpinionWhy a convicted sex offender should not be in the NI squadGraham Spencer and Rev Chris HudsonOpinionUnionism has to stop believing it can get to a new place by staying in an old place,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

When it was announced that the new curator would be serving both Newry and Downpatrick this caused great consternation.ldquoWe can understand that frustration and since our local councils were brought together seven years ago where parity should have existed between Newry, Mourne and Down, it has felt that the legacy Down area has been left behind somewhat.ldquoWe have to be straightforward about the facts and Downpatrick is the county town. This carries major signicance. The historical and ecclesiastical heritage of Downpatrick is equally signicant, as is our links to St Patrick. The museum in Downpatrick is the Down County Museum and must be treated as such.The SDLP politicians say while they appreciate the local authorityrsquos need for a curator that serves both Downpatrick and Newry, they are firmly on the view that the curator must be based in Downpatrick.Cllr Enright confirmed that he and Cllr Brown have also been meeting with the Friends of the Museum over the past few weeks and will be calling for a special motion on the restructuring plan to be debated publicly at next monthrsquos full council meeting.ldquoThe council proposal makes no sense whatsoever at all to promote the relatively insignicant Bagelrsquos Castle in Newry over the Down County Museum which is one of the premier professional conservancy and historical centres in Northern Ireland, added Cllr Enright.Cllr Brownrsquos motion calls for a full-time curator to be based at and responsible for the Down County Museum and that the existing curatorial posts of keeper and assistant keeper of collections are permanently filled and not downgraded, with the vital and highly skilled role of the museumrsquos technician photographer also retained and not downgraded.ldquoI am calling for council officers to develop, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, a new, long-term strategic plan for how the council can most effectively invest in museums across the district, he confirmed.ldquoCouncillors are highly concerned by the plans to downgrade staff provision at the Down County Museum and to base the only full-time museum curator in Newry.

Arrested in Belfast in September , he was a prisoner in Dublin when the Rising raged in  and was despatched along with other State prisoners to Fort George in Scotland the following year.Liberated in , Russell threw himself back into revolutionary politics in support of Robert Emmetrsquos ill-fated coup by attempting to raise once again the standard of rebellion in Co Down. After an anticlimactic call to arms in Loughinisland in July , Russell escaped the county only to be arrested in Dublin and ed to Downpatrick for trial and execution.One of the earliest collections acquired four decades ago by the fledgling Down County Museum was a small parcel of documents relating to the trial of Thomas Russell.The documents include the order from the viceroy, Lord Hardwicke, to initiate proceedings against Russell and the list of jurors who would decide his fate, not that it was ever in doubt. Also contained within the collection is a series of fascinating depositions sworn before local gentry which condemned not only Russell, but two Co Down men, James Corry and James Drake, to execution.The improbability of success for the  Rising is revealed in the deposition of Patrick Doran from Annadorn, who said that ldquonone but fools andmadmen would endorse a Rising so soon after the sobering experience of . Doranrsquos deposition goes on to describe Russellrsquos green Generalrsquos coat, decorated with gold lace and rich epaulettes.Another deposition, from Hugh Magennis, of Ballydugan, provides us with the vivid impression of Russellrsquos ldquomilitary step and appearance, while William Cosby of Saintfield described the mysterious stranger of Wilsonrsquos ballad as a ldquolarge handsome looking man.Such witness statements helped to deliver a guilty verdict and Russell was executed outside the County Gaol, now Down County Museum, on Friday, October , . He was buried in the parish churchyard his gravestone arranged and paid for by the indomitable Mary Ann McCracken of Belfast.These documents held in Down County Museum shed considerable light on an episode of local history that had profound national signicance. Scholars of th century Ireland have visited the museum to consult its rich archive and conferences staged there to discuss the sitersquos deep imprint on Irish history and memory.The size and quality of its collections and the historical importance of its buildings underpin the importance of the internationally-recognised Down County Museum.The ongoing depletion of its highly-qualied and committed staff, which under Newry, Mourne and Down Council proposals now appears to include only a part-time curator, the replacement of the keeper of collections and an assistant with two new positions at a signicantly lower grade, and the removal of the important position of a photographer technician, reflects a disregard for the heritage industry in the county and represents an insult to the hundreds of donors who presented valued family possessions to Down County Museum in the good faith that the Council would preserve, celebrate and cherish them.The fear of many is that the downgrading of the Museum mdash for that is what this is mdash will lead to a reluctance among the public to donate artefacts to the collection and undermine applications for the funding of future projects.The public knows exactly what kind of jewel we have in Down County Museum.

With five minutes to go in the half they kicked a penalty to the corner and executed an effective catch and drive line-out to bring the deficit to one point at -.The home support were glad to see the conversion attempt bounce back off the uprights.Down maintained their slender lead into the break when they would turnaround to play with the wind in the second period.Throughout the second half, Down half-backs, Benjamin Hart and Brian Mitchell, managed the wind advantage very effectively to maintain territorial pressure on the County Tyrone school.However, it was the green forwards who capitalised on this pressure scoring all the points that would see the local school comfortably through to the semi-finals.In the th minute second-row, Reuben McKibbin touched down, in the th minute hooker, Fionn Carey got over the line and Ryan Connolly got Downrsquos fth and final try of the day seven minutes from time with Phillips converting two of these tries.With a minute to go in the fixture, Omagh did manage to score a consolatory, unconverted try, although Down Highrsquos controlled attack and physical defence were too strong for a repeat of the early season outcome between the two sides.In other Down High fixtures last week, a hybrid U- U- team came from behind to defeat Clounagh U-s -, while the U-s added to their impressive record this season with four victories over Methodist College, Belfast.The Medallion B XV also defeated Omagh Academyrsquos Medallion team - on Saturday morning in a pre-cursor to the first XV game.

Nineteen other councillors, from the SDLP, Ulster Unionists, DUP and Alliance voted in favour.A lively debate was sparked by the SDLPrsquos Mr John Doris and involved  other councillors.Mr Doris said while he was keen to support the charity which will benefit from the drag hunt the council has money invested in Delamont and he felt it was ldquoinappropriate for the horses and hounds to go across the council track of land.He said the Delamont country park is taking shape very well and it would be ldquovery unwise to allow it to be used in this way.Mr Doris told councillors it would be ldquofoolish even to allow a drag hunt on an experimental basis.He said there is no guarantee that the hunt will stay on the periphery of Delamont.Party colleague, Mr Cathal O Baoill, argued in favour of permitting the hunt. He said the type of person who is a hunting, shooting and fishing man, like something from the Irish RM, is a major tourist attraction. It is a section of the countryside and a major cultural aspect which should be preserved.He pointed out thatthe hunt is successful, it will result in a smelly bag being torn apart.DOWNPATRICK ndash An alternative line has been suggested this week for the poundm Downpatrick town centre by-pass.Down Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, is suggesting that the road could be constructed along part of the route of the former railway line.Mr Biggerstaff believes thatthe line is adopted by the Department of Environment, it will considerably reduce the costs of the provision.ldquoI would envisage incorporating part of the old railway line embankment as the foundation for a new roads system, said Mr Biggerstaff.He expressed concern that the Government-backed regeneration of Downpatrick will be hampered by the failure to resolve the traffic problem.ldquoThere will be no point in regenerating Downpatrickthere isnrsquot road network facility to make use of, she said.ldquoAfter meeting officials of the Department, it is my view that the by-pass will eventually go ahead.

The Eastern Health Board has announced that intends closing Mourne House residential home for the elderly, despite a strong protest lobby.A spokesman for the Southern Board said last weekrsquos vote was ldquototally unanimous and followed preliminary discussions with staff and patientsrsquo relatives.The two-storey building, which was built in the rsquos, was turned into a holiday home for the mentally handicapped in . At one stage it provided holiday accommodation for  patients.With the Board running down its holiday operations at Navan House in recent years, it is now being used as an extension of the Boardrsquos mental health hospital in Armagh and contains  patients.The spokesman said the decision to close is in line with Board policy aimed at ing people to the community.ldquoNavan House costs around pound, a year to run. The Board believes this money could be better spent developing community services, he continued.The spokesman said a final decision will only be taken following consultations with patients, staff, local councillors and community groups.ldquoThere is a general recognition that we should have fewer long-stay patients in mental hospitals. There is no need to retain a facility which is  miles away from the main hospital in Armagh, the spokesman added.CROSSGAR ndash SDLP MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, has reported success in his campaign to have the mains water system in the Crossgar Killyleagh area improved.The South Down MP pointed out that after serious supply problems just before Christmas  he took the meter up with the Minister, Mr Richard Needham.ldquoI am now pleased that the Department having considered a study is designing a scheme to lay a waterman from Raleigh to New Line, Crossgar, which will increase the reliability of the supply to the Killyleagh and Shirley areas.

One of these on the Downpatrick Roa has already been replaced and work to replace the other at Kerry Drive should be completed by the end of this month.ldquoThis is indeed welcome news and hopefully the new waterman will enhance the standard of supply in these areas, added Mr McGrady.SAINTFIELD ndash A lamb processing plant providing up to  jobs is being planned for Mid Down.A facility handling , lamb carcasses a year could be up and running within twelve months, it was announced this week.A number of green-field sites in the Saintfield, Crossgar and Ballygowan areas are being considered, with construction work could begin in August.The main behind the scheme is Mr Alex Waugh, a director of the Newtownards-based company, Milltown Livestock and Meats.A separate company led by Mr Waugh is currently involved in discussions with the Industrial Development Board, the Department of Agriculture, the Planning Service and other government agencies.ldquoThere are a lot of hurdles to cross, but I am confident the factory will be built. Initially, we would hope to employ  people, rising to around  with two years, Mr Waugh said.ldquoThis will be an ultra-modern processing plant in the provincersquos main sheep producing area. I have spoken to many farmers and I am encouraged by their remarks, he continued.ldquoWe do not have a sheep processing plant in Northern Ireland and only three abbatoirs have slaughtering facilities for sheep. At present, less than half of our lambs are processed in the province.Mr Waugh said the plant will provide an opportunity for the sheep industry to gain a larger shore of the important British and European markets.Mr Waugh added: ldquoWe are progressing as quickly as possible and hope to get started by August or September. If that happens, there is no reason why we cannot be in production by next April..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2022_Kilcoo.jpg","title":"Kilcoo win All Ireland  ","story":"KILCOOrsquos triumphant senior footballers ed home to jubilant scenes on Saturday night after their dramatic extra-time win over the much-fancied Kilmacaud Crokes in a pulsating All-Ireland Club final at Croke Park.Hundreds of supporters gathered outside the clubhouse at Paacuteirc Eoghan Rua as the Andy Merrigan Cup was proudly laid on the village pitch for the first time ever.Indeed it was the first time that the coveted All-Ireland title was back in Down since the all-conquering Burren side brought it home in .After one of the most dramatic finals in recent history last weekend, Kilcoo players finally got their hands on the trophy, confirming the sidersquos place as the best in Ireland.After going so close in  when the Galway-based Corofin snatched the cup from the locals in extra time, there was no heartache last weekend with Kilcoorsquos late late show securing victory.Amid wild celebrations at the final whistle, assistant manager Conleth Gilligan spoke of an ldquoenormous sense of relief.He continued: ldquoWe are delighted to get over the line, for so many reasons. We didnrsquot want the disappointment again. We were actually down in Croke Park last Sunday for a kick-about and we did a presentation with the lads.ldquoWe happened to do it in the media room and when I walked into it I immediately got that feeling of walking in after the  final loss and having to answer all the questions about where it all went wrong.Conleth continued: ldquoI remember thinking to myself that I never want to have to do that again.For Magpies manager, Mickey Moran, it was a case of creating your own destiny.The Kilcoo boss has suffered All-Ireland heartache on three separate occasions ndash with Slaughtneil, Mayo and Kilcoo ndash and at half-time on Saturday he was on the verge of another when his side trailed by six points.ldquoMickey really gave it good. Every now and again, does give really cross speeches, said Gilligan.ldquoHe hadnrsquot done one of those at all this year he hadnrsquot even raised his voice but this was one where he basically asked the boys to stand up and be counted or get their bags and go out on to the bus now.His words hit home with the players leaving nothing on the pitch as they overcame the Dublin kingpins in a breathtaking finale graced by scintillating football.With just added time of extra time left to play, Jerome Johnston fired the winning goal home to cue scenes of pandemonium that would last well beyond the final whistle.As the players, management and travelling support arrived back up north to their native-village as All-Ireland heroes, Moran prepared a heartfelt speech alongside goalkeeper Niall Kane, who also highlighted the magnitude of their achievement.The celebrations lasted long overnight and into the weekend, with those involved with the club finally relaxing after a strenuous season in which they were forced to never stop working until it was over..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2022_Dance.jpg","title":"Matthew puts in stirring dance in honour of his late friend%2C Ryan  ","story":"A MOVING dance tribute to his late friend who died in an accident earned Matthew MacNabb the top score of the night in Sundayrsquos Dancing With The Stars Ireland.The contemporary dance from the Downpatrick man and his partner Laura Nolan also got the top combined score of the night between judgesrsquo scores and viewersrsquo votes, which means they are immune for being sent home next weekend.The  year-old, who gained popularity from his appearance in ITVrsquos Love Island over the summer, met his friend Ryan Freeman while he was travelling in the United States.Ryan died in an accident in Phoenix, Arizona, at the age of  while Matthew was quarantining before he went on to Love Island.Matthew chose to honour his friend in the lsquodedicated dancersquo night week as each celebrity paid tribute to someone special in their lives.He told the Recorder: ldquoIt was an incredible moment.

They say residents have been looking for a modern leisure complex for over two decades.Council chairwoman, Cathy Mason, was one of a number of local politicians provided with a progress report on the Newcastle project last week by senior council directors.She described confirmation of plans for new leisure facilities in Newcastle as really welcome news.She continued: ldquoThese new local amenities will be of great benefit to local residents, their families and tourists alike and I am delighted that the plans are in the final stages. The plans will include a new leisure pool and state of the art gym facilities.Cllr Mason also reaffirmed the view that the rear of the Newcastle Centre is no longer fit for purpose and, as a result, will be demolished in the near future.She continued: ldquoFor too long, the people of Newcastle have had to put up with substandard facilities. I hope to see the finalised plans for the new leisure complex and site approval in the coming months so that contractors can start working on the project as soon as possible.The council chairwoman said it is essential that the local authority ldquomoves in a timely manner to ensure the leisure centre project comes to fruition so that Newcastle residents can access the new facilities as soon as possible.Cllr Mason said Sinn Feacutein will continue to do all it can to ensure the new leisure facilities are delivered, insisting that she will continue to stand up for rural families across South Down to provide essential services in the heart of their respective communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Roads officials urged to address pedestrian safety in Darragh Cross  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to consider providing a new pedestrian crossing in Darragh Cross as part of a series of measures to make the village safer.The appeal was made by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown when he met with a local roads official in the village last week to discuss increasing concern about pedestrian safety as a result of the speed of vehicles.The Department for Infrastructure has said while there will not be a mph zone implemented in Darragh Cross due to current legislation, it has been asked to extend the current mph in force outside the villagersquos primary school and the nearby Barnamaghery Road.Cllr Brown has also asked the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership to locate one of its electronic speed indicator signs in the village.He said the devices have helped reduce speed in other areas and believes that one in Darragh Cross would be effective with a decision on his request expected next month.ldquoA speed indicator device will help address speeding concerns in an area where children are particularly vulnerable and I would like the sign in place as soon as possible, he continued.ldquoI have also discussed with roads officials the potential opportunity for a pedestrian crossing near the main shop which would be funded by the government departmentrsquos active travel department, which would be another welcome measure for pedestrians in Darragh Cross.Cllr Brown said that as a result of his recent meeting which he described as ldquoconstructive, roads officials gave a commitment to assess safety railings in place a Manse Road.ldquoThis particular issue was raised with me last month as damage to part of the railings is adding to residentsrsquo safety concerns. The assessment will happen after the new local authority-funded play park has been built at the GAA site, he said.Cllr Brown confirmed that he is also pushing for the safety railings to be extended from the Oaks Restaurant to the GAA ground to ldquomaximise the safety of residents, in particular, families with young children who will be making frequent use of the site.He added: ldquoI share residentsrsquo concerns about road safety in Darragh Cross and believe that enacting these measures over the coming months should be a departmental priority.ldquoHowever, I hope that collectively, these steps will begin to alleviate many of the villagersquos safety concerns for the future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2022_Traders.jpg","title":"Traders invited to get  involved in town future  ","story":"TRADERS in Downpatrick are being urged to have their say on the future development of the town with a primary focus on what can be done to revive its economic fortunes.The appeal comes after Newry, Mourne and Down Council confirmed that it is to organise a workshop event to gauge the business communityrsquos key priorities, particularly in a post-Covid environment.Details of the workshop event comes as the debate continues about appointing a dedicated town centre manager who would act as a link between the business community and wide range of statutory agencies and funders to help drive new initiatives and opportunities.Council officers have already spoken with a number of businesses on the issue, but it was confirmed at Monday nightrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee that a more co-ordinated plan now needs to be developed.Officials argue this is necessary in order to agree priorities on the way forward to manage expectations through the development of strategy focused on the needs of the town.Plans for a workshop to discuss the issue are being drawn up with appeals to everyone in business in Downpatrick to take part to provide as wide ofview of the potential way forward as possible.The workshop will focus on the main priorities to help develop a new strategy with calls for an independent person to head up the exercise which, it is hoped, will outline recommendations on the way forward.A proposal to appoint a Downpatrick town centre manager to help plan the townrsquos economic revival and long-term future was tabled last year and referred to the council committee for discussion.A number of councillors believe such an appointment is a ldquocritical component of the drive to support the business community, increase footfall and, crucially, help attract new investment to the county town.It has been suggested a town centre manager could work closely with the business community to develop fresh ideas and initiatives, but nothingwill happen before the outcome of the proposed workshop is known.Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed confirmation of the workshop and are fully supportive of the development of a strategic plan being mapped out for the town.Cllr Curran believes that appointing town centre manager deserves close attention and is keen to hear what the business community and other stakeholders have already said about the way forward.ldquoI see great merit in having a dedicated town centre manager, he continued.ldquoThe proposed workshop that is to be held is crucially important and I would appeal to everyone in business to get involved and have their say. This is a crucially important exercise and it must happen as soon as possible.Cllr Curran believes one area that requires particular focus is developing Downpatrickrsquos night-time economy which he is confident would help breathe new le into the town centre.He is also keen for Downpatrick to have an umbrella body representing all business groups and interests, pointing to the success of Chambers of Commerce which he believes play important roles.ldquoAgreeing the way forward for Downpatrick is crucial and a new strategy can help kick-start the townrsquos economic revival, especially at a time when ambitious plans are being advanced for the regeneration of the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty adjacent buildings, Cllr Curran added.Welcoming plans for the workshop, Cllr Hanlon said it has been identied that a strategic plan needs to be considered to focus on the needs of the town.She also confirmed that she as met with a number of stakeholders who believe that Downpatrick needs a strategic plan.ldquoThere is so much effort and productive work from local groups such as the Town Committee and Community Collective alongside local businesses, Cllr Hanlon continued. ldquoEngagement from a iety of stakeholders via theworkshop will ensure that we have a bold and progressive plan for the future of Downpatrick.She added: ldquoCouncil assistance to facilitate this is will be imperative as we continue to build our local economy, arts and events offerings..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2022_Minister.jpg","title":"Tributes and presentations to Downpatrick clergyman  ","story":"ANOTHER chapter in the distinguished history of Downpatrick Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church closed last Sunday when the Rev Dr David Speers preached his final service after  yearsrsquo service.Dr Steers, who was also in charge of Ballee and Clough Non-Subscribing Presbyterian churches, is leaving the district to take up a new post in Dunmurry.He introduced his final service with the history of the replica High Cross which stands at the entrance to the Down Cathedral, explaining how its engravings depict Jesus Christ and the prophets St Anthony and Paul and how the illustrations guided the early Christians over a thousand years agoDr Steers said the Non-Subscribing congregation in Downpatrick worships in a building erected over  years ago, encouraging them to keep this faith going.He continued this theme with readings from Psalm  and the first letter to John, explaining the dference in the perception of God from the Old to the New Testament, with the departing ministerrsquos sermon reminding the congregation that despite their comfortable lives, to continue to do Godrsquos work in the community.Laura Patterson accompanied the hymns lsquoHoly, holy, holyrsquo, lsquoJust as I amrsquo, The Lordrsquos my shepherdrsquo and lsquoGod sent his Sonrsquo.At the conclusion of the service, church treasurer, Carol Nixon, spoke of Dr Steers leadership, pastoral care and how he led by example, fully participating in all the church worship and witness as well as many fundraising events.In addition, she reminded those in attendance of his leadership, both within the church group and in the community where he is well known and respected by all denominations, and wishing him the congregationrsquos blessing in his new charge.The Downpatrick churchrsquos senior elder, Mr Freddie Straney, made a presentation to Dr Steers and thanked him for his loyalty and  yearsrsquo service.Eileen Neill, on behalf of the younger members, presented Dr. Steers with a delightful and talented illustration of the Downpatrick church which she had created, with Ms Nixon presenting the ministerrsquos we Sue, with a flower arrangement, thanking her for the many ways she had supported her husband both in and outside the pulpit.Also during Sundayrsquos service, the congregation took the opportunity of presenting Mary Stewart with a gold brooch, church illustration by Eileen Neill, flowers and rose plants to mark her  years as church secretary.Dr Steers responded to his gts with moving words which touched everyonersquos spirit.He recalled how he became associated with the church in  and was in charge in  before being fully appointed in the group, also thanking Mary for all her work.The ious speeches were dficult and emotional, but very sincere and from the heart.

We need to find a way of unlocking that money without the Executive,” she said.Ms Hargey has claimed that while the funding has been secured for the initiative, the approval of the wider Executive is required before it can progress to allocating funding for projects at specic grounds.Ms Hargey has blamed the DUP for the situation, claiming the party’s decision to pull Paul Givan out of the first minister’s role meant the stadia programme had to be placed on hold until a ing administration is back in place.The DUP has disputed this position and contrasted it with the minister’s insistence that the redevelopment of the GAA’s Casement Park in west Belfast can continue despite the Stormont crisis.On Thursday, a spokesperson for the Department for Communities said: “The Minster has been clear that the .m to regenerate stadiums is ring fenced.“The Minister is absolutely committed to delivering this investment to support clubs and build first class facilities.“It is well known that options for the future of the sub regional stadia programme requires Executive approval.“The collapse of the Executive is preventing the regeneration of local stadiums.“The Minister is exploring all options available in the current situation.“Today the Minister held a meeting with representatives of the IFA and NIFL and agreed to work together to progress this project to the next stage.”In a statement released following that meeting with the Irish Football Association and the Northern Ireland Football League, Ms Hargey said that she had welcomed the chance to “reaffirm my commitment and intention to deliver this much needed scheme”.She said that she had told the two footballing bodies that she would work with them to “progress this project to the next stage”.Following that meeting, Northern Ireland Football League boss Gerard Lawlor said: “We held an open and frank discussion and we received assurances: the programme will proceed as planned, acknowledgment that an increase on the m is required and is being sought, and the programme remains a flagship project for the Executive.“Communication is key in the delivery of this programme going forward and I hope to see it delivered in a timely manner,” he said.The DUP has sought to portray the comments of Ms Hargey as a u-turn.The party’s deputy leader accused Ms Hargey of attempting to “play sectarian politics” with the issue.“The Minister has had two years to deliver the funding.“Indeed, last September she told us it was just weeks away,” Paula Bradley said.“It’s time for Minister Hargey to set her Sinn Fein political games to the side and get on with her job and deliver the funding.”Deirdre HargeyDUPSinn Fein  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularWhat time will Storm Eunice hit  When and where will Storm Eunice hit -

The process has intensied an ongoing heated debate about which party is most likely to secure the first minister’s position after May’s election.But Lord Empey said the debate would never even have arisenthe DUP and Sinn Fein had not amended the legislative basis of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement which he says they both did in the legislative version of the St Andrews Agreement in  .   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Both he and Mr Maginness said the DUP and Sinn Fein tweaked the Belfast Agreement so that Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness did not have to be presented to MLAs on a joint ticket for approval in an Assembly vote.Furthermore, the changes meant that the first minister would no longer necessarily come from the community with most MLAs, whether unionist or nationalist, but rather from the largest single party.As a result, both men said every election since has degenerated into a “sectarian headcount” or “ethno-nationalistic” battle for domination.Asked why politics has become so ill-tempered since the days of David Trimble and John Hume, Lord Empey said: “What has happened is that the agreement that we negotiated [in ] was changed.“Under our proposals that we had ratied [in ], the largest party in the largest designation, ie unionist or nationalist, would provide the first minister and the largest party in the second largest designation would be the deputy first minister. Two names then went before the Assembly on a single resolution to be elected by the Assembly in a cross-community vote. But that was changed to suit Paisley and McGuinness.”He claimed Mr Paisley did not want to be seen on a joint resolution with former IRA commander Martin McGuinness, and that Mr McGuinness did not want to be subject to a unionist veto, due to his paramilitary past. And this, he believes, is at the root of the tensions today.“It has completely changed the whole way devolution operates. The tenor of election manestos changed after that with a major focus on keeping the other party out or securing first minister for Sinn Fein.”He added that under the original legislation, “there would be no question of Sinn Fein being first minister because there would be more pro-Union MLAs than nationalist MLAs”.But his criticism does not simply extend back to  .“The DUP has also been resisting attempts in Parliament that we have been making in the last number of months and weeks to try and change the legislation back to the original proposal.”The News Letter asked the DUP and Sinn Fein why they changed the means of electing the first and deputy first ministers, and why they didn’t back recent efforts to change it back again. The News Letter also askedthey prefer the St Andrews arrangements because they believe it will better motivate their voters to turn out.The DUP response did not address any of the questions.Fermanagh and South Tyrone MLA Deborah Erskine said: “A SF win at the election would take Northern Ireland in the wrong direction. They would have more MLAs, more ministers and more influence than any other party. That would be bad for Northern Ireland. We want to spend the next decade fixing our health service, driving down waiting times, improving our schools and making Northern Ireland better. SF want to spend the next decade undermining Northern Ireland and talking about a border poll. “Unionism needs to stand together rather than attack each other. Reg just can’t help himself attacking fellow unionists.” Sinn Fein offered no response.DUPSinn FeinMartin McGuinnessMichelle ONeillPaul Givan  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularWhat time will Storm Eunice hit  When and where will Storm Eunice hit - and will it snow in Northern Ireland This is no time for unionist weakness on the Irish Sea borderBelfast university culture spat: ‘No-one is convinced by efforts to portray the Irish language as cross-community’Storm Eunice Northern Ireland: Weather forecast for Northern Ireland as Met Office warns of snow and windStorm warnings for Northern Ireland now include heavy snowMost Popular best weighted blankets  for adults and kids: from Argos, Amazon, Wayfair and LakelandRoyal Mint releases commemorative £ coin to mark  years of FA CupBest snow sled and tobaggans UK : sleds for adults and children including plastic, wooden and inflatableAldi’s popular hanging egg chair is back in stock - here’s how to buy online, and how much it costsBest Aldi dupes : top perfume, skincare, beauty, makeup, cleansing balm products from Lacura to le Creuset                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Here is everything you need to know.\" alt\"Penarth Times: The Army has been placed on standby as the UK prepares for the arrival of Storm Eunice. \" class\"editor-image\"The Army has been placed on standby as the UK prepares for the arrival of Storm Eunice.Whether employees get paid on days when they cannot make it into the office will largely depend on their contract of employment. Many employers will have a ‘bad weather policy’, so it is always worth checking your contract. However, on a general note, employers do not have to pay employees who are unable to get into work, subject to their contract.Employees are expected to make reasonable efforts to attend work despite any severe transport disruption or road closures. However, it is usually best practice to be flexible in these circumstances by allowing employees to request the time off as annual leave or to work from home.With the help of technology and the coronavirus pandemic, many employees should be able to work from home. However, it is important to remember your employer should not force you to attempt the journeythere are legitimate concerns for your safety.\" alt\"Penarth Times: Storm Eunice weather warnings map. \" class\"editor-image\"Storm Eunice weather warnings map.If your employer has closed the office because it is inaccessible they should usually still pay employees for that day. Withholding pay when employees are unable to work through no fault of their own could be considered as an unauthorised deduction from wages.In those circumstances, employees may be able to bring a claim against their employer. However, it should be noted that some employment contracts contain a temporary ‘lay-off’ clause. If this is the case, employers can refuse to give the full amount of pay to employees to a limited time.Can you take time off workyour child’s school is closed due to Storm Eunice Schools are often closed when there is bad weather, forcing many employees to stay at home to look after their children. If a school was closed at short notice, this would constitute an emergency relating to a dependant, in which case, you would be entitled to take time off as dependency leave.This type of leave does not have to be paid.

Many employers will have a ‘bad weather policy’, so it is always worth checking your contract. However, on a general note, employers do not have to pay employees who are unable to get into work, subject to their contract.Employees are expected to make reasonable efforts to attend work despite any severe transport disruption or road closures. However, it is usually best practice to be flexible in these circumstances by allowing employees to request the time off as annual leave or to work from home.With the help of technology and the coronavirus pandemic, many employees should be able to work from home. However, it is important to remember your employer should not force you to attempt the journeythere are legitimate concerns for your safety.\" alt\"Penarth Times: Storm Eunice weather warnings map. \" class\"editor-image\"Storm Eunice weather warnings map.If your employer has closed the office because it is inaccessible they should usually still pay employees for that day. Withholding pay when employees are unable to work through no fault of their own could be considered as an unauthorised deduction from wages.In those circumstances, employees may be able to bring a claim against their employer. However, it should be noted that some employment contracts contain a temporary ‘lay-off’ clause. If this is the case, employers can refuse to give the full amount of pay to employees to a limited time.Can you take time off workyour child’s school is closed due to Storm Eunice Schools are often closed when there is bad weather, forcing many employees to stay at home to look after their children. If a school was closed at short notice, this would constitute an emergency relating to a dependant, in which case, you would be entitled to take time off as dependency leave.This type of leave does not have to be paid. Your employer can not refuse you dependency leaveyou have no other choice and you cannot be disciplined or sacked for taking the time off.For further employment law advice, visit the Lime Solicitors websiteAre you sure you want to delete this comment Yes, delete the commentNo, keep the commentReport This CommentGet involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Most popularCommentedLoading...Read more Contact UsHelpNewslettersPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

You go into the likes of Ballybogey and Bushmills and they have facilities for all weather and they can play all year round.“We have  kids eager to play and yet we go through this every year and the pitch cuts up. It can’t take the weather and can’t take the elements.”Portrush FC Youths would like to see a G or G pitch installed enabling the youngsters to play in all conditions.Mr Quigley said: “Let’s move with the times. We are happy to try funding, we know council don’t have the money to pay for it all but eventhey say we are willing to pay a percentage towards it but unfortunately we aren’t getting anything from them.“There’s a chance some of those kids won’t come back. They are trying to run through the muck and there’s tears because they were falling in the mud then they were soaking wet and freezing cold. These are six and seven-year olds, it would be dferentthey were on a G pitch that wouldn’t be an issue and it’s a far better environment.“It’s demoralising for us as coaches to go down there and try and get kids to kick a ball through a mud bath.”Addressing his comments to the councillors who represent the Causeway DEA, the club Chairman added: “Please come down and take a look at it for yourselves and see what we deal with on a daily basis. Speak to the coaches, the parents and children.“These kids are speaking to their friends who are saying I was training at Coleraine on the G or at The Showgrounds but we don’t have that luxury, we can’t even get a slot up there to hold a training session.“We don’t really want to take the kids out of Portrush and not everybody has a car and then we have to take into account the additional cost of travel for parents.“It is so frustrating that from  when I started to  we are still struggling with the same issue. We have kids coming from all over, from Bushmills and Portstewart as well as Portrush and people have had enough. Would you want your kids playing in conditions like this  I doubt it.”The DUP Causeway DEA councillors spoke of their commitment to help Portrush FC Youths adding that a meeting has been arranged with the club and council officials within the coming days which is the next stage of an ongoing process.Councillor Mark Fielding said: “I have been working with the club on ious issues since  and will continue assist them now and in the future.“It is quite obvious that there is issues to resolve with the current facilities in order to ensure that they are of a standard that meets the needs of the club and local people.”Fellow Causeway DUP Councillor John McAuley added: “Following contact this morning from Portrush FC Youth regards the condition of their facilities, I have had discussions with the club and council officers with a view to achieving short, medium and long term improvements. “I have been involved in local football now for nearly  years so I am well aware that winter training has and continues to cause many clubs a problem. “The good news is resolutions are possible and have been achieved in other areas of the borough in the past.“I am committed to giving Portrush FC Youths support to get the same outcomes for their facilities.East Londonderry MLA Maurice Bradley said: “I was in talks two years ago with council officers on behalf of the Coleraine and District League as part of the council’s consultation process into the borough’s pitch strategy. “As part of an overall strategy it was recognised that there was a lack of G facilities in the borough and Parker Avenue was in the mix along with other sites.“I would be happy to meet with Portrush Football Club and Portrush Youths at any time to discuss facilities. “I have been having meetings with council officers with the hope of having roll-on, roll-off goals at Parker Avenue and other grounds.“I believe that facilities are important, facilities allow clubs to grow and sports enthusiasts to improve. “But, in the short term, I would encourage members of Portrush Youths to lobby their local councillors.“Having been involved for many years in football and campaigning for better football facilities right across the old Coleraine Borough Council area, I support improving facilities for Portrush Youths and also for all clubs across the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council area.”Meanwhile, SDLP MLA Cara Hunter posted on the club’s social media that she would ‘be writing to the Department for Communities and Sport NI to identythere are any funds to resolve this ongoing issue.’When contacted, a spokesperson for Causeway Coast  Glens Council said: “The club’s designated training pitch was passed fit for purpose at the beginning of this week.“Council officers will visit the site today to assess the ground conditions and, in the interim, will engage with the club to offer an alternate venue.”The Local Democracy Reporting Service contacted other councillors, however, they had not responded at time of going to press.Read More Read MoreKillowen PS kids learn about ‘refill’Mark FieldingCara HunterPortrushBushmills  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house.

The campaign promoted the unique nature of le onboard, with % time-off providing the perfect work-le balance for people wanting to live and work onboard for either a one or two-week sht and then spend equal time off. The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign. We have never received so many applications. It really goes to show how many people are attracted to a le at sea with a company like Stena Line. Now our HR team has the challenge of how to sort and interview so many applicants, but that is a nice challenge to have. Thank you to every single person that has applied to work with us.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_badcbfabcff   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dffdbbecddffdcc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645108869381.jpg--covid_19___thu_17th_february_figures.jpg?164510887000","title":"covid  thu th february figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows one further coronavirus related death and , new positive test results.
