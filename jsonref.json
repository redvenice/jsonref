I think the best case is it\u0027s equivalent in severity to Delta... but you\u0027ll see milder symptoms now, than Delta when it emerged, because many more people have immunity now.\u0027A pre-print published yesterday suggested Omicron was around three times more likely to re-infect people who had had Covid before.South African researchers said there had been 35,670 reinfections since the beginning of the pandemic, and the risk of reinfection was 0.7 per cent during the country\u0027s Beta-fuelled second wave last winter and Delta wave in the summer.But the risk of catching the virus again has recently spiralled to at least 2.4.Scientists from Stellenbosch University, near Cape Town, said the findings suggested Omicron was better able to evade immunity in people who had already been infected than other variants which were suppressed by immunity.A pre-print paper means it has not yet been reviewed by other scientists, who double-check its findings.Microbiologist at Reading University Dr Simon Clarke said the data was the \u0027first indication\u0027 that Omicron could get around immunity from previous Covid infection. He said: \u0027There are a few caveats in this work, such as not having definitively confirmed that it was indeed Omicron that was causing the reinfection, but they were able to determine that the increased transmission of Beta or Delta variants was not a result of immune evasion. \u0027There is no indication as to how this immune evasion happens, although it can be presumed to be because of decreased antibody binding to Omicron\u0027s mutated spike protein.\u0027He added: \u0027Omicron has blown a big hole in the controversial argument that we should simply allow the infection to spread in an attempt to create immunity. \u0027Herd immunity which now seems like nothing more than a pipe dream. We await a further indication as to whether Omicron has any ability to evade vaccine induced immunity.\u0027Infectious diseases expert at the University of East Anglia Professor Paul Hunter said: \u0027The implications of this paper are that Omicron will be able to overcome natural and probably vaccine induced immunity to a significant degree. \u0027But, the degree is still unclear though it is doubtful that this will represent complete escape.\u0027He added: \u0027It remains the case that the extra value of the booster vaccination dose remains the most important step that we can take to reduce the probability of severe disease. \u0027I suspect new targeted vaccinations will be developed against omicron but it the infection spreads globally as rapidly as it seems to be taking off in South Africa then most of us may already have had the infection by the time a new vaccine is available.\u0027 The variant has been spotted in more than 30 countries worldwide and is likely to have been spreading for weeks before South Africa raised the alarm. The Netherlands detected a case one week earlier, while Nigeria found its first case in a sample taken in October. ¿Enforce jabs, not lockdowns¿- Strong resistance likely to any new lockdown measures over OmicronWill the omicron Covid variant wreck Christmas?"},{"url":null,"title":"Joe Biden hosts Kennedy Center honorees jokes SNL creator trying seven guys play me","story":"Share this article There have been a few presidential misses over the years - Carter missed the 1979 event because of the Iran hostage crisis George H.W.

Inflation is already more than double the Monetary Policy Committee’s target, and heading higher - as regulator Ofgem is likely to lift the UK’s price cap sharply higher next April. Broadbent also explains that rising goods prices, driven up by supply chain problems and high demand in the lockdown, have pushed inflation over target. He argues that those pressures on traded goods are ‘more likely to subside than intensify’ over the next couple of years.  So if they are transitory, they would dissipate before any rise in interest rates (to dampen demand) had taken effect. Indeed it’s quite possible that, in a couple of years, some of these tradable goods prices will be falling, pulling down on inflation, Broadbent says. Instead, a tight labour market could be a bigger driver of inflation, if wages keep rising as firms compete for workers. Diane Wehrle, Insights Director at Springboard, says the data provide “the first evidence of an early impact on footfall of the Omicron variant”  The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) is lowering the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks by 50 basis points (bps), from December 15th, which will release 1.2 trillion yuan (£140bn) in long-term liquidity to bolster lending, and stimulate growth. China’s economy has already lost momentum in recent months, hit by Covid-19 outbreaks, pandemic restrictions, and a slowdown in its factory sector - as well as debt problems in the property market. The slump is being blamed on the broader move away from riskier assets, due to concerns over Omicron, a weak US jobs report on Friday, and the prospect that America’s central bank ends its stimulus package earlier due to worries about inflation. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains: Other crypto assets, such as ethereum, are also weaker, flags interactive investor’s Victoria Scholar: They finished at just $1.81 Hong Kong dollars, after warning that it cannot guarantee funds for a looming $260m guarantee obligation.  That’s down from around HK$15 at the start of the year, before fears over its debt mountain grew. Data firm IHS Markit reports there was a sharp increase in business activity at building firms last month. It was led by an upturn in commercial work, as the economic recovery led to new projects and infrastructure work.  Port delays and a severe lack of transport availability due to haulage driver shortages did still hold back suppliers, but firms noted an improvement in the availability of specific items (especially timber).  Tim Moore, director at IHS Markit, says UK builders saw a welcome combination of faster output growth and softer price inflation last month. Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply, says supply chains seem to be improving, given the fall in companies reporting longer waiting times. The number of plug-in cars potentially sharing a public on-street charger jumped from 11 in 2019 to 16 in 2020. That 16:1 ratio is much worse than other major economies, such as South Korea (3:1), the Netherlands (5:1), China (9:1), France (10:1), Belgium and Japan (both 13:1).  The situation hasn’t improved this year, with just one standard on-street public charger installed for every 52 new plug-in cars registered in the first nine month of the year. That still left registrations nearly a third below their pre-pandemic five-year average, with chip shortages hampering the supply of new cars to forecourts. More motorists turned to electric cars last month the number of battery electric vehicle registrations more than doubled year-on-year to 21,726.  However, the number of new cars registered to large fleets declined by nearly a quarter. Ted Baker said the veteran businessman, who was appointed non-executive chairman of the troubled fashion retailer last year, died suddenly. “John was a source of great wisdom for me and for so many of us at Ted Baker and we will hugely miss his support and guidance,” said Rachel Osborne, the chief executive of Ted Baker, who joined a month before Barton’s appointment in April 2020. Last week, the 77-year-old stood down as chairman of easyJet, ending a near nine-year stint during the most tumultuous period in the low-cost airline’s 26-year history. Barton last year weathered an attempted ousting by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the airline’s founder and largest shareholder, who threatened to requisition a series of shareholder meetings after the coronavirus pandemic hit to force easyJet to abandon £4.5bn of planes from Airbus he believed would bankrupt the business. “I am truly shocked and extremely saddened to hear of John’s passing,” said Johan Lundgren, the chief executive of easyJet. Stephen Hester, the former boss of Royal Bank of Scotland who took over from Barton as the chairman of easyJet, said he was a “distinguished chair who made an outstanding contribution to the company” and was “also a wonderful human being”.  Output and new orders both increased during the month, according to the latest survey of building firms across the euro area from data firm IHS Markit, with construction activity rising at a series record pace in Italy. There was a sustained rise in home building activity, as well as a second successive rise in commercial construction, but civil engineering work fell again. However, the report also found that severe supply chain delays kept pushing up builders’ costs, while business confidence fell to a seven-month low. Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, said: There are early signs the UK’s shortage of lorry drivers could improve, which could help with the supply chain crisis next year. Logistics UK, which represents freight and haulage businesses, said the number of drivers leaving the profession had begun to ease, and that more trainees are coming through the testing system. Elizabeth de Jong, policy director at Logistics UK, said the sector was seeing “green shoots” of recovery, and that HGV driver numbers should improve as new trainees join the sector.

But, it added, urgent action had averted a far worse outcome.  According to the WHO’s latest World Malaria Report, there were an estimated 241m malaria cases worldwide in 2020 - 14m more than a year earlier. The estimated death toll from the disease rose 69,000, to 627,000. About two thirds of the additional deaths were linked to disruptions in the provision of malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment during the pandemic, the WHO said.  But the agency stressed that the situation “could have been far worse”, pointing to its projection early in the pandemic that service disruptions could cause malaria deaths to double. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, said: “Even before the COVID-19 pandemic struck, global gains against malaria had levelled off. “Thanks to the hard work of public health agencies in malaria-affected countries, the worst projections of COVID’s impact have not come to pass. Now, we need to harness that same energy and commitment to reverse the setbacks caused by the pandemic and step up the pace of progress against this disease.”The finding suggests the variant, first flagged by neighbouring South Africa and Botswana late last month and since labelled “of concern” by the World Health Organization, is also highly prevalent in the southern African country.  The Omicron cases were detected predominantly in and around Windhoek, the capital. The region that recorded 536 out of 695 new infections countrywide in the first five days of December.  The other non-Omicron sample sequenced among the 19 was the Delta strain.  Scientists around the world are trying to establish the impact of the new variant on contagion, disease severity and vaccine resistance.  “We must remain on guard while we wait for further investigation about this variant,” Namibia’s health ministry said in a statement, according to Reuters. “Tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow at the latest, we will present a second (package) related to the Christmas situation, and as reaction to the virus’ Omicron mutation because the situation is indeed not looking good … We have many deaths,” Morawiecki told a news conference, according to Reuters. “We will strengthen the vaccination mechanism, making it compulsory for some jobs. We are considering this and we will certainly discuss stronger restrictions in certain places for people who are not vaccinated.” Current pandemic restrictions in Poland include limits on the number of people allowed into public venues, such as restaurants, bars and shops, the wearing of masks in enclosed spaces, and curbs on travel to seven African countries – a recently introduced response to the emergence of the Omicron variant.  At the height of the pandemic, everything from mental health and coastguard services to care homes had to quickly change how they operated, and coroners across England are highlighting failures made during this time through reports that identify avoidable deaths. They include a woman who missed out on vital mental healthcare because of Covid cancellations and a frail elderly woman who fell and died in a care home after she was put into self-isolation. These notices, known as reports to prevent future deaths, are issued in very rare cases when it is decided that if changes are not made another person could die. Olaf Scholz, who is to succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor, picked Karl Lauterbach for the closely watched appointment, according to the US-based news agency the Associated Press.  The agency described Lauterbach as a “media-savvy lawmaker who lacks executive experience but has been one of Germany’s most prominent voices urging caution and strict measures against Covid-19”. The appointment comes on the heels of tough new restrictions, at both state and federal levels, that largely target people who have chosen to remain unvaccinated. The German parliament is to also consider a general vaccine mandate. Asked about prospects for the Christmas period, Lauterbach said that “an important aim must be to bring the case numbers down so far that we can recommend travel without endangering people”.John Swinney said that is what he was doing to ensure the maximum level of protection for his household and the public at large.  Swinney told the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland programme:  You can read more about what happened here in this news report.  The children, part of a trial at 28 schools in the capital region, were sat down at desks fitted with plastic screens, wearing face masks, Reuters reported.  The government aims to reopen all schools in January, as it tries to return the country to normal after imposing some of the world’s toughest pandemic restrictions. A hundred schools in lower risk areas reopened last month. Precautions in the trial openings include capping class sizes at 15 pupils to avoid overcrowding. The Philippines, which has has recorded 2.84 million Covid-19 cases and 49,499 deaths in total, is one of the last countries to reopen schools.  Daily infections have fallen sharply to below 1,000 since 24 November, from a peak of over 20,000 in September, paving the way for a wider economic reopening.

RIA said Omicron had been detected in two arrivals from South Africa. Argentina’s health ministry said their case is a 38-year-old resident of the western Argentine province of San Luis, who arrived on 30 November from South Africa on a flight via the US and has been in isolation since. The patient involved, who was fully vaccinated, had given a negative PCR test prior to travelling and another negative antigen test upon arrival in Buenos Aires, the ministry said. The person tested again after finding out colleagues at a work event in South Africa had tested positive for Covid. “The epidemiological objective currently is to contain and delay the possible community transmission of new variants of concern,” the ministry said. The patient was in close contact with four people, who are also in isolation but have no symptoms and their PCR tests have been negative, the ministry said. All will be subjected to another PCR test at the end of their isolation.

One in three felt more positively towards the HSE since before the pandemic began.The survey found there had been an increase in the satisfaction with the level of care delivered since 2018 but almost four in 10 felt the service delivered was deteriorating.There was a strong sense of job security among staff, but satisfaction levels have fallen back on the previous survey three years ago. A third said they were dissatisfied at present.Less than half said they feel they have necessary resources to be able to do their jobs. Half of staff felt senior managers did not involve them in important decisions or act on staff feedback.BulliedDespite the fact that an anti-bullying taskforce was set up after the previous survey, the same number of staff reported experiences of being bullied by a colleague as in 2018. Three in 10 said they had experienced bullying or harassment at work from a manager, team leader or other colleagues.Three-quarters of people said they were enthusiastic about their job, an increase of eight points on three years ago, while six in 10 said they looked forward to going to work, up four points.More than eight in 10 people said they were satisfied with the quality of care they gave patients, an increase of nine points on the 2018 survey.Key areas cited as needing improvement centred around recognition and being valued.Asked about the survey, a spokesman for the HSE said: “The last two years have been very challenging for staff, and the resilience and positive attitudes of staff shows great commitment to working to make the lives of patients and service users better.”The spokesman said the HSE would use the survey results “to inform how to make the health service a better place to work in the future by improving workplace culture, increasing frontline staff numbers and allowing more flexibility in working conditions”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"people in their 50s may get covid 19 vaccine booster earlier than planned","story":"The booster jabs are expected to be administered initially by appointment only at vaccination centres for people who have had their second vaccine dose at least five months earlier.

However, journalists from The  and other media outlets who contacted GIS and requested to speak to Nphet members were told they were “unavailable”, even though members had previously indicated their willingness to be interviewed if GIS consented. New advice to schools to be issued this morning has stressed children from third class up should not be excluded from schools “in the first instance” for not wearing masks. Instead, the school should engage with the parents and, if no progress is made, contact an inspector from the Department of Education. The new guidance says when a school agrees with parents that a mask is not appropriate for a child, no medical certification is needed for an exemption.

It’s scary, to think you’re living in a place that is meant to be your safe place and you’re hearing the walls cracking.”Five of the special needs assistants – nearly half of the special needs staff – have mica homes, and so do some of the students they support. A hoist used by one child is attached to a crumbling mica wall, while foster parents have bought two mobile homes to house their children with complex needs.“They need routine, they need to know what happening... they’re going to be moved into two mobile homes behind their house and watch their house getting knocked down,” says Moore.In school, he says, you can “see the children who have mica, or whose houses have mica. They are, like their parents probably are, nearly obsessed with the fact they have mica.“As staff you’re trying to accommodate and support children... but they’re going home to houses that aren’t safe and that are causing them grief and stress.”Guidance counsellor Sineád McCarron’s home also has mica she warns of “what’s coming down the line... this is just going to explode, really, in terms of the amount of support the students need.”As principal, Doogan has significant concerns about the physical and mental health of students and staff – not least through heightened levels of anxiety – and about the impact on students’ attendance and life chances the effects, he estimates, will persist for the next five to 10 years.The anxiety of students and parents “is having an impact on their work rate and their effectiveness at their studies at school,” he says.“Every secondary school in the country”, he emphasises, has seen the effects of Covid “We’re at the beginning of this cycle for mica and in two years’ time, when there’s a large number of houses in this community which need to be demolished and rebuilt, there will be severe anxiety and perhaps worse felt by a lot of our students.”There is also “clear evidence” of an increase in absenteeism due to illness – “they’re living in draughty rooms, the rooms are colder, the rooms are causing them health issues that they wouldn’t ordinarily have” as well as students from mica homes who have left school altogether.Brother and sister Shaun and Aoife Noone describe how their home is “falling down”: “If I put my hand in the wall I could just pull away some of the side of the house,” says 17-year-old Shaun.They have moved out so that their home can be demolished and rebuilt. “I don’t really have a study room so that’s affecting my study, because I’m doing my Leaving Cert now, and it’s harder to focus and settle down and get work done,” he says.“I feel disadvantaged, it’s unfair that most people would stress or be anxious about exams but I’ve got the pressure of my house on top of that, so it’s a bit hard on the mind as well.”Aaron Price (13) and his family have also moved out. “It was a lot to handle trying to go to school and do homework and trying to empty the house.”The Government this week announced a €2.2 billion scheme to rebuild mica homes in Donegal and Mayo, capped at €420,000 per home and with a sliding scale of rebuilding costs from €145 per sq ft for the first 1,000 sq ft to €110 for the next 1,000 and €100 thereafter.It has been criticised by the mica campaigners in Donegal as falling short. “Apparently a new scheme was decided but it’s stupid, apparently each square metre gets less money, that doesn’t make sense,” says Aaron.“We need 100 per cent, and I know we probably will never get that, but if it was in Dublin, this would already be fixed.“It’s not our fault, we spent a lot of money on building our house... why should we have to spend more and more money rebuilding our house?”The adults have done the figures each of those spoken to by The  is facing a shortfall of between €60,000 to €80,000. “If council houses are being built at the minute they are built on a rate of €150 a square metre,” says Moore. “What was being offered would work out essentially for our house at €127 a square metre, which would leave us paying €65,000 on top of what we would get.“My other half is a psychiatric nurse, we’re no millionaires, we’re working-class people and we live in an average size house in Donegal which is the average in the country for a one-off build, 2,500 sq ft.“If they had dropped the sliding scale part... 145 euro per square foot, that’s it, and then your rent and then your storage, I would say 90 per cent of people would have been happy and celebrating, but they put in a scale that doesn’t exist in any builder’s pricing.”“The cost to me right now is €79,000, and that’s just for the build,” says Ruddy. “My house is 2,600 sq ft... that gives a total of €315,000 of a grant. The builders have come back to me with €395,000.“I can’t borrow because I have a mica home... 100 per cent redress is so far from it, I don’t think I’m even getting 80 per cent redress.“My children are at the stage where I should be starting to save for their college. Am I going to build their house and deprive them of education? We’re facing these choices.”“People bought the material in good faith... yet they are being victimised to the extent of having to spend 40, 50, 60, €80,000, whereas other areas were given 100 per cent redress,” says Doogan.For him, it is about the value placed on people from this area, not least given that the school itself is still “nowhere near completion” 20 years after it opened. “We bailed out the banks for €64 billion, and they’re saying three or four billion is a huge amount of money, but it’s less than five per cent of what we gave to the banks.“The people up here paid their taxes to pay for the bank bailout, and people here, like me, paid their taxes to pay for the pyrite redress in Dublin and Leinster. People round here are saying, ‘is there a different law for us?’”McCarron, too, is clear: “How can we help people look after their wellbeing and instil value systems of fair justice when our own Government continues to let this happen?”“They’ve let us down,” says 15-year-old Aoife. “If this was happening in Dublin, I feel it would be a different story, because we’re that far away and we’re rural they say ‘ah, them Donegal ones, they live in big mansions, they can afford it’. We can’t.

Photograph: Daniel McLaughlinIn a cemetery beside a mosque on the outskirts of Nazran, a small city in the republic of Ingushetia at the foot of the Caucasus mountains, stand 192 unusual headstones.Only a name and date of birth are carved on each one, because these graves await people whose precise fate is unknown, but who are presumed dead after vanishing during the first conflict to erupt in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union.The fighting in late 1992 between Muslim Ingush and mostly Orthodox Christian Ossetians lasted for only six days, but continues to taint relations between their republics today, and left another knot of pain and anger in Caucasus history that is scarred by centuries of violence, oppression and unresolved grievances.“Twenty-four of my relatives were killed or disappeared,” says Ayub Tsurov, who manages the memorial cemetery and for nearly 30 years has led efforts to find the remains of Ingush victims in neighbouring North Ossetia and bring them here for burial.“The official investigative agencies and prosecutors said they were looking for the missing, but in fact they hardly did anything . . . We have approximate information on the places where people are buried, but there is no response to our appeals from that side. They don’t want to work with us on this,” he explains.“I saw with my own eyes . . . how armoured vehicles came in, and then marauders or militiamen or whatever you want to call them stole what they could and destroyed our homes,” recalls Tsurov, who was held hostage for 1½ months in North Ossetia until a prisoner exchange was agreed.“I know who took me – he grew up with me, we were at school together. I’ve told investigators everything – who took me, in what car, how it happened, who took my brothers – but there’s no reaction. They just make excuses,” he says.ResentmentThe fighting killed about 600 people, most of them Ingush, and drove tens of thousands of Ingush from the Prigorodny district of North Ossetia, which borders Ingushetia. Many still cannot return to their homes, compounding resentment over the failure of North Ossetian and Russian authorities to punish crimes committed in October and November 1992, or to find and return the remains of the missing.“Silence won’t get us anywhere,” Tsurov says. “But if we resolve this it will help people get over it, people will calm down and the atmosphere will be totally different.”Tension rose last month after at least three fights between Ossetians and Ingush in North Ossetia. No one was badly hurt, but the way these relatively minor incidents were swiftly blamed on inter-ethnic enmity, stoking local political alarm and anger on social media, showed there is still heat in a dispute that is rooted deep in Soviet history.A century after Russia fought to conquer the Caucasus and bring its mostly Muslim population into the Tsarist empire, Soviet dictator Josef Stalin ordered the mass deportation to Siberia and Central Asia of several entire nations, on the pretext that they had allegedly aided the German invasion of the country in 1941.In early 1944, more than half a million Ingush and Chechen people were transported, many in wooden cattle cars, to remote and inhospitable tracts of steppe, thousands of miles from their homeland in and around the soaring Caucasus.After his death in 1953, the Soviet authorities denounced Stalin’s most heinous crimes and cleared the deported nations of the slur of Nazi collaboration, but forced expulsion and exile had already killed hundreds of thousands of their people.When the Ingush were allowed to go home in 1957, they found the fertile farmland of Prigorodny district had been transferred to North Ossetia and settled by Ossetians who moved there – sometimes on Soviet orders – after the deportations. Many Ingush returned, but the issue became a flashpoint between the nations.Moscow ruled in 1991 that the district should return to Ingush control, but North Ossetia did not comply, and amid the spreading chaos that followed the implosion of the Soviet Union that same year, Ossetians and Ingush took up arms and began killing and kidnapping each other.Favoured nationFederal troops arrived to end the fighting but did nothing to reverse the expulsion of the Ingush, reinforcing a perception here that Russia’s favoured nation in the Caucasus are the Ossetians, a largely Orthodox Christian people who were less hostile to the Tsarist takeover of the region than many of their Muslim neighbours.A much bigger crisis was already brewing just to the east in Chechnya, where from 1994-96 and again from 1999-2000, Russian forces would battle militants whose fight for independence came to be dominated by Islamist extremists, spawning a terror campaign across the North Caucasus and elsewhere in Russia.The devastating wars killed hundreds of thousands of civilians in Chechnya, and in 1999 about 200,000 Chechens fled to Ingushetia, which also suffered gun and bomb attacks as the war and anti-terror operation spilled over onto its territory.Despite the two nations’ history of close ties and shared suffering, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov – whose own reign of terror has helped the Kremlin crush resistance in his homeland – pushed through a deal in 2018 to take up to 10 per cent of Ingush land, sparking big protests in the region that police violently dispersed.The agreement remains unacceptable to many Ingush, and amid their fresh criticism of the pact and other border disputes, Kadyrov ordered his powerful security forces to conduct manoeuvres on the Chechnya-Ingushetia frontier late last month.He is also “absolutely sure” that Moscow will not allow serious conflict between Ingushetia and North Ossetia, but sees disturbing signs online of the anger still simmering in society.“There’s already something like a war taking place on social media,” Akiev says of the response to the recent fights between Ossetians and Ingush.“I see from comments on both sides that the conflict hasn’t disappeared. It’s alive, it’s still there like a dormant volcano, just waiting to explode with the same degree of hate,” he warns.“Our main criticism of the authorities is that they are doing nothing to solve this and improve relations . . . starting with programmes for children, so they don’t grow up with this hostility,” Akiev explains, highlighting work that Memorial has done to aid small businesses for Ossetians and Ingush in Prigorodny district.“The federal authorities don’t need any border conflicts and will do all they can to avert that. But I hope at some stage they won’t just prevent conflict with force – again driving people underground – but will actually deal fundamentally with the problem and help people make peace.”Political controlIn Vladikavkaz, capital of North Ossetia, prominent local blogger Alik Pukhaev also sees Moscow relying on tight political and security control to maintain stability in the Caucasus, rather than major investment to lift the whole area out of poverty.“There are some simple decisions that could be taken on a local level quickly, but when the authorities try to hold back and freeze all processes, then of course tension emerges,” he says.“Tension between people in the Caucasus, not just between Ossetians and Ingush, and lots of other local problems would be removed by economic growth, by development of business, by development of civil ties – it would solve everything in a few decades, but it’s not happening,” Pukhaev adds.The official North Ossetian view of the 1992 fighting is that brave defenders of the republic fought off an unprovoked attack by vengeful and land-hungry Ingush extremists.Memory of the clashes retains less pain and power here than in Ingushetia, partly because Ossetians effectively won the conflict and suffered far fewer losses than the Ingush, but also because a later act of violence inflicted deep trauma on this society.In September 2004, Islamist militants seized a school in Beslan, 25km north of Vladikavkaz, and took more than 1,000 people hostage. The three-day siege ended in explosions and a chaotic gun battle between the attackers and security forces, which left 333 hostages dead, including at least 180 children.Most of the militants were from Ingushetia and Chechnya, and one theory holds that they hoped their attack would spark all-out war between Christians and Muslims in the Caucasus.Federal forces were deployed to counter the threat of wider violence, but the subsequent disappearance and suspected murder of more than 20 Ingush in North Ossetia is thought to have been the work of local vigilantes.“The history of Ossetia is ided into before and after Beslan,” says Pukhaev, standing by the Terek river that rushes down from the mountains and bisects Vladikavkaz.“This had such a powerful effect on the minds and souls of people here . . . It was an unbearable event.”In Nazran, just 25km east of Beslan, Akiev says the attack “was also seen here as a terrible tragedy. Ingush society absolutely distanced itself from those who did this.”Best friendsOn the road between the two towns, builder and part-time taxi driver Rolan tells a very different story of Caucasus life, of how he – an ethnic Armenian – grew up in Georgia, just over the mountains from Vladikavkaz, with an Azeri and an Ossetian as his best friends at school.“They live in Vladikavkaz now. When I moved to Russia eight years ago, they welcomed me so warmly that I decided not to continue on to Moscow. So I settled down here with my wife and child. When we feel nostalgic we drive through the mountains and spend a couple of days in Tbilisi and in Rustavi, where we grew up.“When we were young, no one talked about who belonged to which nationality,” Rolan says. “All that started in the 1990s after the Soviet Union collapsed and conflicts began. We were all just Soviet kids.”Such harmony is much harder to imagine now, after post-Soviet wars between Armenia and Azerbaijan and between Georgia and Russian-backed separatists in South Ossetia.The same Soviet Union that gave Rolan his happy childhood condemned several Caucasus nations to bitter exile, however. Among the Ingush exiles were the parents of Tsurov, who spent his early years in a remote village in Central Asia.“I was born in Kazakhstan after my parents were exiled in 1944. Then in 1992 I was expelled . . . from my home,” Tsurov says at the cemetery in Nazran.“Every year we mourn here on October 30th, the day fighting began in 1992, so the dead and the missing are not forgotten,” he adds.“We need to find the missing and allow them to be buried. If we don’t, it will be a permanent stumbling block between Ingush and Ossetians. The sooner we remove it, the better it will be for them, for us and for Russia - for everyone.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"History of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo role"},{"url":null,"title":"300000 housebound people yet get covid booster vaccines","story":"Nearly two-thirds of housebound people are yet to receive Covid booster vaccines after many GPs opted out of delivering top-up jabs, The  can reveal.Ministers were accused of ignoring those at greatest risk from the virus as internal Whitehall data revealed at least 300,000 people unable to travel for jabs have not had a booster.Relatives of elderly and vulnerable people up to 10 weeks overdue for boosters said they had been given no answers by the NHS despite fears over the omicron variant, cases of which surged more than 50 per cent in a day on Sunday.In a sign of growing concern over the slow rollout, Sajid Javid last week said GPs would be paid a £30 incentive for every housebound person given their booster, and would be freed from carrying out routine health checks on over-75s.However, a significant proportion of family doctors who visited people\u0027s homes to give first and second jabs have already opted out of the booster campaign, saying they do not have the time or the staff. It follows weeks of negotiations between GPs and the Government over who should be responsible for driving the booster campaign and an ongoing row about doctors\u0027 workloads.On Sunday night, senior doctors said ministers had known since the summer that many GPs would not be giving home boosters and accused the Government of a serious failure to come up with a replacement plan. One Tory MP blamed the slow rollout on faceless bureaucrats in the NHS, while another said he would demand answers from Boris Johnson.In guidance this week, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said it was clear that those at greatest risk must be prioritised, including those who are housebound. The majority are understood to be in elderly and clinically vulnerable groups declared eligible for boosters on Sep 16.But according to an unpublished Whitehall analysis seen by The , only 170,000 housebound people had been given top-up jabs at the end of last week – around 36 per cent of the estimated total cohort of 470,000. Some estimates have placed the total number of housebound in England at closer to a million.More than 60 per cent of over-50s have been given boosters, and the over-40s were invited for jabs two weeks ago. Ministers have set a target for all eligible adults to be offered top-ups by the end of January.On Nov 29, Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, told the Commons booster vaccinations were being primarily carried out by GPs. Asked on BBC Breakfast last week about an 83-year-old who had been unable to get a booster at home for more than a month, he said: I don\u0027t know the details of that particular situation, but it does worry me to hear that.In areas including Kent, London, Wiltshire, Cambridgeshire and Devon, responsibility for visiting the housebound has been taken over from GPs by local NHS clinical commissioning groups or contracted out to pharmacy firms. NHS England has also asked for help from an army of St John Ambulance volunteer drivers.But the rollout has faltered in many places, with NHS leaders struggling to find staff to go out and administer the jabs.Last week, Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust said more than 5,000 were yet to receive a home visit. Bath and North East Somerset, Swindon and Wiltshire Clinical Commissioning Group asked for patience while staff carried out a logistically complex programme.In Buckinghamshire, health leaders admitted a contract with a leading pharmacy to transport vaccines to people\u0027s homes fell through two weeks ago.Charles King, a 91-year-old from Guildford in Surrey, described the situation as a total disgrace and said: Two months ago I was told by the NHS that I\u0027m a vulnerable person. I\u0027ve had three emails from the NHS to get a booster jab, and I\u0027m simply unable to get one. I served my country, I spent four years in the RAF. I want it to serve me in my old age.David Warburton, the Conservative MP for Somerset and Frome, said: I will be asking the Prime Minister how we\u0027re going to get the booster to all, and if I can meet Saj to get to the bottom of this and seek a quick remedy.Kelly Tolhurst, the Conservative MP for Rochester and Strood, said faceless bureaucrats at NHS clinical commissioning groups were able to avoid the criticism aimed at GPs for not providing boosters fast enough and added: We need a proper system for dealing with housebound patients.Caroline Abrahams, the charity director at Age UK, said: The general clunkiness which has affected the booster rollout seems to have resulted in some housebound older people still waiting for a nurse to provide them with their booster jab.This would have been worrying in any situation, but is all the more so now because of the potential threat from the new omicron variant the new omicron variant.Prof Azeem Majeed, a GP in west London and the head of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, said his practice had opted out of delivering boosters but stressed that the Government had been given plenty of time to come up with an effective new strategy.There is certainly too much variation in the delivery of jabs to the housebound, and that is a significant problem because many of these people are extremely vulnerable to Covid, he said.But many GPs opted out months ago. Plenty of people have been warning since the summer that we needed to come up with a new integrated system to deliver jabs to people in their homes. Clearly, there has been a failure to do that.Deborah Hughes, 61, from Rochester in Kent, has been trying to secure a booster vaccine for her 90-year-old mother, Mel, since the end of October.At the end of October, Mum became eligible for her booster jab, she said. Due to her housebound status, I had to ignore the text links to book a slot and contacted the surgery for guidance. I was told it was nothing to do with them and to ring the community nurses, who also told me that they hadn\u0027t been commissioned for the programme.That left me with no option other than to contact Mum\u0027s MP, who has taken up her case. Recently, it was said the time to gain immunity by Christmas was running out. If this is the case, how many elderly and vulnerable will be infected as a result of medical commissioners\u0027 disregard and incompetence? Serious questions need to be asked regarding this failure.Earlier this year, a Freedom of Information request showed that a fifth of primary care networks – groups of GP surgeries – who took part in the first phase of the vaccine programme had pulled out of the second.In a letter to The , Dr Gary Howsam, vice chair of the Royal College of GPs, argued that throwing money at GPs was no panacea to increasing productivity, adding: General practice is the bedrock of the NHS and needs to be adequately supported to manage the ever-growing demand for care and to ensure that patients are safe.An NHS spokesman said: Local NHS and GP teams are contacting their eligible housebound patients, and we are working closely with St John\u0027s Ambulance to give local areas additional support. We are also providing additional funding to help local teams secure additional staff so that all eligible housebound patients are offered a booster as quickly as possible.More from NewsTravel news latest: Fury grows within travel industry after U-turn on pre-departure tests Coronavirus latest news: Boris Johnson insists new omicron travel rules were not too little too lateBoris mustn\u0026#39t underestimate the challenge from Reform UKPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson vows to ruin Christmas for county lines gangsPrince Harry brands cash for honours row involving Charles\u0026#39s foundation \u0026#39CBE scandal\u0026#39The Government is right: judges have become too powerful More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"astrazeneca vaccines unlucky","story":"“I would just like them to hold their hand up and say, ‘we’re very much aware that this has happened and we’re going to do something about it’. And I’d like them to do that without taking it away in the next breath.“In no other circumstances where so many people have lost their lives would that happen. They wouldn’t say 72 people sadly died in the Grenfell tower fire, but hundreds of people didn’t. We don’t forget those who were wounded in conflict or those who did not come home.”These are the words of Gareth Eve, husband of Lisa Shaw, the 44 year-old BBC Radio Newcastle presenter who died in May of a rare brain hemorrhage, confirmed by a coroner in August to have been caused by rare complications from the Oxford AstraZeneca jab which scientists believe they discovered the trigger for last week.His is a tough story to hear, but it is made worse by being so hard for him to tell publicly.Gareth and hundreds of others in the UK who have lost loved ones, or seen their lives irrevocably changed by blood clots and other vaccine-related injuries, find themselves in a terrible position as the real stories behind the statistics.Not only are they being forced to battle for the lives, memories or continued care of their partners or children but – although it could not be further from the truth – they know that doing so risks them being branded as anti-vaxxers or even unpatriotic.“Lisa rolled her sleeve up for the country and said, ‘Right, well, I’m going to get my jab, because that’s what we are being told is the right thing to do’,” says Gareth, who had his second vaccination after his wife’s death, and is now bringing up the couple’s six-year-old son Zach alone. “She did it, like all the others, because it would mean that our little bit of the world, our family and community was better protected. And yet nobody even recognises them”.The number of people who have life-changing adverse reactions to vaccines for Covid-19 is a tiny proportion of the many millions of vaccines given, but is mounting in absolute numbers. (the exact percentage is not known)Up to November 17, the MHRA had received Yellow Card reports of 426 cases of major thromboembolic events (blood clots) with concurrent thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts) in the UK following vaccination with AstraZeneca. The overall case fatality rate was 17 per cent with 73 deaths. There have been, in addition, a small number of other rare adverse reactions which have led to death or disablement – as there are with nearly all pharmaceuticals.Sarah Moore, a partner with the London law firm Hausfeld, represents the families of 95 people impacted by such injuries, including Gareth Eve. Nine have suffered bereavement, while most of the others are caring for close relatives with life-changing injuries. “All have experienced, at first hand, a range of severe adverse health events following Covid-19 vaccination,” she says.When Covid vaccines were first authorised for use in the UK, the Government indemnified the manufacturers and took on liability for any adverse reactions. It then added all of the jabs used – including the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine – to the Vaccine Damage Payments Scheme (VDPS).“The UK has one of the most comprehensive immunisation programmes in the world, and sensible routine precautions such as these form a huge part of our global-leading standards in safety,” boasted the Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, when announcing the move just ahead of the launch of the Covid vaccination campaign in December 2020.“The VDPS is a safety net to help ease the burden on iniduals who have, in extremely rare circumstances, experienced harm due to receiving a government-recommended vaccine,” added the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) at the time.Moore and her clients are not anti-vaccination or suing the government, but campaigning for change: they say the VDPS is not a “safety net” worthy of the name.Launched more than 40 years ago to build confidence in national vaccination programmes, it is now hopelessly out of date – and in danger of doing the exact opposite.Paper-based and under-staffed, it has proven slow, bureaucratic and unresponsive. Claimants must show they are more than “60 per cent” disabled to make a successful claim as well as proving “causation”, which is notoriously difficult to prove. Worse, even for cases that are successful, the maximum total payout is just £120,000.“While £120,000 is a substantial sum of money, it will provide limited security where an inidual has been severely disabled and, particularly, where they may have dependents,” says Moore. “It is significantly lower than the awards that are achieved in personal injury claims involving similarly severe injuries.” Such awards can run to the millions.Historically, the VDPS has received about 100 claims a year, but Covid vaccinations mean that number has dramatically increased.“There are currently c.500 cases (as at November 2021) that require assessment, with this volume currently increasing per week by c.20 cases,” notes a recent government tender document for the running of the service. “It is estimated that in year one of the contract there will be c1500-1800 claims that will require assessment within the first year of the contract,” it adds.Kate Scott, a 32-year-old mum of two boys, age four and one, is one of those claimants. She is struggling to keep the roof over the family’s head after her husband Jamie, 44, suffered a brain injury after receiving the Oxford Astrazeneca jab this spring.Jamie spent 124 days in hospital and was lucky to survive his doctors thought he would need to live in a care home for the rest of his life. But, although he is now home with Kate and their boys, the brain injury he still lives with has changed his life.“We feel like the luckiest unlucky people because, despite all of this, Jamie has made more of a recovery than any of the medical teams thought possible,” she says. “But our life is still dramatically impacted. He’s able to communicate with us and to outsiders, he looks like he’s very much almost back to normal. But for our family that’s not the case.”Jamie can no longer work as a software engineer or even care for his children without supervision, for example.“I solely have to be responsible for the boys as he can’t independently look after them at the moment, which is very difficult for him as well,” says Scott. “He’s amazing. His motivation is truly inspiring, and the doctors have used the term miracle. I feel sometimes when I get upset that I’m being ungrateful. I know that others have lost loved ones.”Kate has had to stop working as a customer service coordinator for a children\u0027s charity to look after Jamie and the children full time. They are struggling financially and Kate worries they may have to sell the family home. She points out the £120,000 maximum payment from the VDPS scheme was worth £500,000 or more when the scheme was launched in 1979.“That’s a lot more money and enough to pay off most people’s mortgages. It would mean Jay could just focus on getting better or one day, he could do a vocational job, perhaps, where there was less pressure on him. It would mean that what has already been traumatic for our children doesn’t get worse. That we don’t have to move house because of it.”In the summer, Kate wrote to Boris Johnson to draw his attention to the holes in the Government’s vaccine safety net. Like others, she pointed out that other developed countries have more generous schemes.“You have suffered a heartbreaking and frightening change but I would like to pay tribute to your strength in proposing changes which you think could improve the situation. You’re not a statistic, and must not be ignored. I am deeply touched by your story.”Johnson went on to say he had asked the DHSC to consider the proposed reforms but, to date, there has been no announcement of change and not a single case has yet been settled via the government scheme. Indeed the DHSC has been directing victims like Gareth and Kate into the benefits system. Not surprisingly, real anger is building.“They promised a safety net if things went wrong but you are made to feel like you’re saying something controversial or, you know, wrong by raising it”, says Gareth. “Lisa’s death has been confirmed at an inquest as being caused by a vaccine. It says here on her death certificate she died due to ‘complications of an AstraZeneca Covid Vaccination’. It doesn\u0027t get more black and white than that. That is what happened to her. Fact. For Lisa and all the others I’ve heard about, there is no grey area about it.”A government spokesperson added: “More than 115 million COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the UK, saving countless lives and serious side effects are extremely rare.“The Vaccine Damage Payments Scheme helps to ease the burden on iniduals who have, in extremely rare circumstances, been severely disabled due to receiving a government-recommended vaccine.“All vaccines being used in the UK have undergone robust clinical trials and have met strict standards of safety, effectiveness and quality set by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency’s (MHRA).”More from NewsTravel news latest: Fury grows within travel industry after U-turn on pre-departure tests Coronavirus latest news: Boris Johnson insists new omicron travel rules were not too little too lateBoris mustn\u0026#39t underestimate the challenge from Reform UKPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson vows to ruin Christmas for county lines gangsPrince Harry brands cash for honours row involving Charles\u0026#39s foundation \u0026#39CBE scandal\u0026#39The Government is right: judges have become too powerful More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"chorister 12 becomes bishop 45 minutes","story":"A 12-year-old girl has become a bishop for 45 minutes as part of a cathedral\u0027s long-running tradition.Chorister Isabel Moss donned the bishop\u0027s cope, mitre and ring and carried the staff to lead a service at Salisbury Cathedral on Sunday.She sat in the intricately carved Cathedra – or bishop\u0027s throne – to deliver a sermon and lead the choir and congregation in prayer.Isabel, who is from London but boards at Salisbury Cathedral School in Wiltshire, is the latest in a long line of chorister bishops.The tradition dates back to medieval times when a boy chorister would hold the office of bishop from the Feast of St Nicholas – the patron saint of children – on Dec 6 until the Feast of the Holy Innocents on Dec 28.During that time, he could appoint clergy and distribute the church\u0027s money as he saw fit.Henry VIII put a stop to the practice of appointing child bishops in 1541, declaring it a distraction from proper church business.Salisbury Cathedral revived the practice in its present form in the 1980s. Nowadays, the chorister bishop only holds the role for the service and is as likely to be a girl as a boy.Being chosen for the temporary role is a great honour and marks a chorister\u0027s contribution to the choir and cathedral music. Isabel not only sings with the choir but also plays piano and flute, likes art and is a member of the school\u0027s hockey team.David Halls, the director of music at Salisbury Cathedral, said: Isabel is an exceptionally good singer and an excellent role model for the younger choristers.She has been in the choir for four years and was made a senior chorister in September. She knows how to work hard but also enjoy life, which is exactly what we want our choristers to do. Singing with a cathedral choir is a big responsibility – but it is also great fun.More from NewsPolitics latest news: No Christmas party took place, insists No 10 amid claims of lockdown breachTravel news latest: Fury grows within travel industry after U-turn on pre-departure tests Coronavirus latest news: Boris Johnson insists new omicron travel rules were not too little too lateBoris mustn\u0026#39t underestimate the challenge from Reform UKPrince Harry brands cash for honours row involving Charles\u0026#39s foundation \u0026#39CBE scandal\u0026#39The Government is right: judges have become too powerful More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"public has turned against excesses lockdown fanatics","story":"This time last year, Professor Neil Ferguson observed how China’s draconian anti-Covid restrictions had influenced the response to the virus across the Western world – not least the UK. “We couldn’t get away with it in Europe, we thought,” said the epidemiologist, dubbed Professor Lockdown. But after Italy shut down “we realised we could”.When Covid-19 first emerged as a global pandemic in early 2020, Prof Ferguson had assumed, like the vast majority of government advisers, that severely restricting freedoms would be deemed unacceptable by the British public. Controlling where people go and who they meet was seen as a non-starter in a liberal democracy. How wrong that turned out to be. Not only did people accept the lockdowns, but there was a level of enthusiasm for them – and a level of derision for those who questioned them – that astonished those of us who had thought that the UK was a nation committed to liberty.It is not clear, yet, that we are heading back to the dark days of truly draconian anti-Covid measures. But the early signs aren’t good. In response to the new omicron variant, the ratchet has slowly been tightened. Ministers have re-introduced compulsory masks on public transport and in shops. Travel controls are back, with compulsory PCR tests plus quarantine when returning from “red list” countries. And, from tomorrow, there are mandatory pre-departure tests for everyone aged 12 and above.So far, the public has been willing to accept these measures. Many of them are, wrongly, deemed to be minor and most people just want to do their bit. But if ministers decide to go much further in the coming weeks, can they assume that the public will offer their unquestioning support once again? This time, I’m not so sure. Something has changed in Britain. Having stoically endured three separate lockdowns, there are clear signs that the public’s support for harsh anti-Covid restrictions is fast diminishing.Take the results of YouGov polling from last week. Over two thirds of voters in England oppose the closure of pubs and restaurants, with roughly the same share against anti-Covid restrictions on leaving home. Three in five, meanwhile, reject controls on the number of indoor home visitors. It is true that attitudes towards closing nightclubs remain borderline totalitarian, but if you had asked these same questions in January, you would have found overwhelming majorities in support of any and all restrictive measures. Previously seen as eccentric, lockdown scepticism has quietly become mainstream.There are several reasons for this. The first is an obvious one. After almost two years of disruption and a mass vaccination programme that has covered the vast majority of the population, many people quite rightly wonder what else can be done to protect the vulnerable against severe illness and death. At the moment, the omicron variant does not appear to be the terrifying new threat that some have made it out to be, either. While more infectious than previous variants, the early signs are that it causes only mild symptoms. Proving that, while determining if existing vaccines work against it, could take weeks. But the World Health Organisation said over the weekend there have been no omicron-related deaths, despite the variant being detected in at least 38 countries.Meanwhile, the costs of lockdowns have become far harder to ignore. The fact that GPs made hundreds of thousands fewer suspected cancer referrals during the pandemic, in part due to fewer face-to-face consultations, was last week highlighted in a National Audit Office report. The impact has been “devastating”, says Macmillan Cancer Support, given related delays in the treatment of life-threatening conditions, including among the young. The relentless focus on Covid, the NAO concluded, means that by March 2025, some 12 million people – around a fifth of the UK population – could be on an NHS waiting list, caught in the lockdown-related treatment backlog.The “lives versus livelihoods” debate which characterised previous lockdowns – in which those who opposed restrictions were damned as selfishly concerned solely with the health of the economy – is therefore being exposed as the nonsense it always was. The damage done to children’s mental health and education when schools close is now undeniable – which is why Children’s Commissioner Dame Rachel de Souza yesterday pleaded with ministers to keep schools open. The tragedy of six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, murdered by his stepmother, has also highlighted the pressure lockdown puts on vulnerable households.And now we have enjoyed a real taste of freedom. Until last week, England had faced no legal Covid restrictions since Freedom Day in July. And while a fourth wave of existing variants had sent European nations back into full or partial lockdowns, the UK’s gamble seemed to have worked. Covid-related hospitalisations and deaths are still a fraction of where they were this time last year.It might be convenient for some politicians for the Covid emergency to continue indefinitely. Certainly, for No 10, omicron has crowded out sleaze allegations. Yet, while some voters remain clearly frightened of Covid, broader support for harsh lockdown measures appears to be melting away.People know that two years of restrictions have left the UK in a perilous economic situation. Many are wise enough to realise that tightening them would again crush the UK’s recovery, playing havoc with fiscal balances. It would also further stoke inflation, deepening the emerging cost of living crisis, while doing further damage to pandemic-stricken sectors such as aviation and hospitality.They also know that some of the people who have been keenest on restrictions have got it wrong, again and again. Back in July, as Freedom Day beckoned, Ferguson declared it was “almost inevitable” daily infection rates would hit a record 100,000 and could peak at more than 200,000 after restrictions were relaxed. In the event, daily cases barely topped 30,000 – and have remained steady since.So something has changed. If the Government thinks it can take the UK back into lockdown without a very clear and demonstrable reason, then it needs to think again.More from NewsTravel news latest: Fury grows within travel industry after U-turn on pre-departure tests Coronavirus latest news: Boris Johnson insists new omicron travel rules were not too little too lateBoris mustn\u0026#39t underestimate the challenge from Reform UKPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson vows to ruin Christmas for county lines gangsPrince Harry brands cash for honours row involving Charles\u0026#39s foundation \u0026#39CBE scandal\u0026#39The Government is right: judges have become too powerful More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"government right judges have become powerful","story":"This could have set the stage for an almighty battle between the elected representatives of the people and the judiciary. Instead, Jefferson, the serving president, acquiesced. The court got its way and has ever since had the right to strike down laws agreed by members of the House of Representatives and the Senate.In Britain we have, thankfully, avoided such a situation, largely thanks to the establishment’s resistance to regular demands for a written or codified constitution. But that hasn’t prevented senior judges from over-ruling certain ministerial decisions down the years when their lordships have decided that this or that policy is outwith the explicit remit of the relevant Act of Parliament.Few could oppose such a system. If a minister is acting ultra vires, then he or she is acting against the will of parliament as expressed in legislation, and if a senior judge won’t point this out, who will?Still, there are suspicions that many of the judges making politically embarrassing judgments are themselves adhering to their own political views in the way they are interpreting the law. Which is why there have been reports of government plans to introduce an annual “Interpretation Bill” which would strike down court rulings with which ministers disagree.One of the most consistent arguments used by Left wing campaigners in favour of a Remain vote in the 2016 EU referendum – and it is the same argument that recruited a previously sceptical Labour movement into the EU’s camp in the late 1980s – was that, since British electors kept electing right wing government, we should rely on activist judges in Brussels to impose the “right” kind of social policies on Britain against the will of voters and the government. Whether it was the length of the working week or environmental standards, the European Court of Justice and the European Commission knew far better than the elected government or the silly, reactionary people who voted for them, what was good for us.More from NewsTravel news latest: Fury grows within travel industry after U-turn on pre-departure tests Coronavirus latest news: Boris Johnson insists new omicron travel rules were not too little too lateBoris mustn\u0026#39t underestimate the challenge from Reform UKPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson vows to ruin Christmas for county lines gangsPrince Harry brands cash for honours row involving Charles\u0026#39s foundation \u0026#39CBE scandal\u0026#39French police launch probe into violence at Eric Zemmour\u0026#39s first campaign rally in ParisMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inedible food tears 20 minute daily walks around car park","story":"Cold food, people crying and requesting a 20-minute daily walk around a bleak car park isn\u0027t what most people would associate with a hotel stay. But this is now the quarantine reality for people returning to the UK from South Africa. One such couple serving time at one of the government-appointed hotels is Kate and Alex Freed.After getting married in September, they booked their traditional post-nuptial trip to South Africa.But the honeymoon period is well and truly over, stuck in an awful hotel overlooking Heathrow serving inedible food.Perhaps the most grim condition is that they have to request to go for a walk outside. A security guard accompanies them downstairs, and they are allowed 20 minutes in the hotel car park before being told they have to go back inside, the pair said.Speaking on the third day of their 10-day quarantine period Mrs Freed, 29, said: We’d been planning the South Africa trip for ages… we didn’t book it until the green list changed and the foreign travel advice was that it was safe to go to.Her 30-year-old husband added: To be charged for coming back to your country when the Government’s told you it’s safe to go, I think is just wrong.The couple flew back from South Africa on Dec 2, after having their original flight home cancelled due to the travel ban.It was the trip they\u0027d dreamed of, having been forced to rearrange their wedding day four times due to Covid.They said it took almost six hours to get from the plane at Heathrow to their hotel - the Holiday Inn Express at the airport\u0027s Terminal 4 - including waiting in a bus to be taken to their rooms.They put us onto a bus for the 30-second journey, but we were on the bus for three hours, Mr Freed explained.We were on a bus full of people, (with) no ventilation.It was the most unorganised mess ever. People were crying. It just seemed like something from a film, it was a bit mad, he added.After arriving at the hotel itself, the pair said they had food and other supplies delivered by their family, because the hotel food is inedible.You’re paying serious money and… it’s not substantial meals. Half the time it’s cold, half the time it’s just inedible, Mr Freed said.Travellers returning from red list countries originally faced a cost of £1,750 to quarantine in a hotel when the scheme was first announced in February.The price has now risen to £2,285 for the 11-night stay.I’d rather pay for security outside my flat and they can watch me not leave”, Mrs Freed said.I don’t disagree with quarantine if that’s what the Government want to do… It’s just the cost that’s come with it, she added.The way it is run is awful. I just feel something needs to be done about it, Mr Freed said.The Holiday Inn Express declined to comment, but the Department of Health and Social Care spokesman told The : The quarantine measures we have in place are minimising the risk of variants coming into the UK and safeguarding the hard-won progress of our vaccination programme.The majority of passengers who have used the Managed Quarantine Service have been satisfied with the service. All complaints are treated seriously and are investigated fully.Lauren Hopkins, a recruitment agency boss, says she faces another 11 days stranded in South Africa because there is no quarantine hotel room available until Dec 13 in the UK. She arrived in South Africa on Nov 21 for a 10 day holiday but fears she will not be back in her home until just before Christmas Day.I run a small independent recruitment agency and having worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic to keep it going, I was in desperate need of a break. In reality, this experience has been anything but relaxing and stress free. In all honesty I am ashamed to be British. I, and hundreds of other British citizens have been completely abandoned by our own Government. To say I feel let down is a gross understatement. It\u0027s an utter disgrace.Flights aren\u0027t an issue, it\u0027s getting a hotel quarantine booking that\u0027s keeping us all here. They haven\u0027t put nearly enough on for the amount of us. We\u0027ve been trying since Sunday November 28th to get a booking with no luck. At the moment the 13th December is the earliest availability, meaning we come out Christmas Day and have to fund an extra 11 nights in South Africa. From the communication of the quarantine decision to the lack of any help or cooperation from the Embassy officials to the cancellation of flights homeward, to the severe shortage of quarantine hotels, the acts of our Government have been shocking in their ineptitude.I will never again place faith in politicians or in Departments of State.Richard E Grant has said he was left “confounded” after being stuck in a quarantine hotel charging more than twice as much as a similar alternative nearby.The Withnail and I actor said he had been visiting his 90-year-old mother in southern Africa when he was caught out by the change in travel restrictions.Speaking in a video on Twitter, Grant said: “I went to southern Africa to visit my 90-year-old mother and got caught by the red region Covid restrictions.“It took over a week and many cancelled flights to finally get home, for which I am incredibly grateful.“I understand that there are security costs in the hotel and you’ve got to pay for two Covid tests, but £228 a day to receive 3 meals a day of this very poor standard, in a supposed 4* Holiday Inn hotel, beggars belief.”Grant said his meals, which included a pre-packaged tuna and cucumber sandwich, a sausage casserole and fish and chips, would cost less than £20 to buy elsewhere.A nearby Holiday Inn not being used as a quarantine hotel costs just £89 per night, including breakfast – more than half the cost incurred by red list travellers.More from NewsCoronavirus latest news: Boris Johnson insists new omicron travel rules were not too little too lateBoris mustn\u0026#39t underestimate the challenge from Reform UKTravel news latest: Fury grows within travel industry after U-turn on pre-departure tests Politics latest news: Boris Johnson vows to ruin Christmas for county lines gangsPrince Harry brands cash for honours row involving Charles\u0026#39s foundation \u0026#39CBE scandal\u0026#39The Government is right: judges have become too powerful More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"myanmars deposed leader aung san suu kyi sentenced fours year","story":"A court in Myanmar has sentenced ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi to four years in prison, the first verdict in multiple charges that could put the Nobel Peace Prize winner behind bars for the rest of her life. The ruling was condemned by British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who characterised her sentence as another appalling attempt by Myanmar’s military regime to stifle opposition and suppress freedom and democracy.The United Kingdom calls on the regime to release political prisoners, engage in dialogue and allow a return to democracy. The arbitrary detention of elected politicians only risks further unrest, she added in a statement.Ms Suu Kyi, 76, was detained and put under house arrest by the junta when it seized power in a February coup and has since been hit with 11 charges that have combined maximum sentences of more than 100 years.Monday’s guilty verdicts by a court in the capital Naypyidaw, related to charges of inciting dissent and breaking Covid-19 rules. Maw Htun Aung, a deputy minister in Myanmar\u0027s exiled opposition national unity government reacted with dismay, saying: I don’t expect anything out of this broken justice system.Her co-defendant Win Myint, the former president and fellow leader in the National League for Democracy (NLD) was also convicted over the same allegations and received a similar jail term. Ms Suu Kyi has denied all charges, including serious accusations of corruption that each carry a sentence of 15 years, illegally importing and possessing walkie-talkies and breaking the colonial era Official Secrets Act. The verdict in another case against her is due next week.Former prime minister Tony Blair added to the criticism, saying their imprisonment on trumped up charges shows the ruthless brutality of the current regime in Myanmar and their intention to completely destroy the country\u0027s fledgling democracy.What is happening day by day in the country is tragic, cruel and completely without justification, he added.The junta must understand from the reaction of the world\u0027s leading nations, that there is no way back into the international community without setting out a clear and credible plan for the restoration of civilian rule.It is not clear where she and Win Myint will serve their prison sentences, and their lawyers, who have been served with gag orders forbidding them from releasing information, are expected to file appeals in the coming days. The incitement case involved statements posted on the NLD’s Facebook page after party leaders had already been detained by the military, while the coronavirus charge involved a campaign appearance by Ms Suu Kyi ahead of November elections last year which her party won in a landslide.The military accused the NLD of massive fraud during the poll, but independent election observers said there was no evidence to support this claim. Ms Suu Kyi’s supporters say the charges against her are politically motivated and designed to discredit and bar the popular leader from running against the army in future elections. The trial has also been widely condemned by the international community, which has called for democracy to be restored.Amnesty International immediately denounced the sentences against Ms Suu Kyi.The harsh sentences handed down to Aung San Suu Kyi on these bogus charges are the latest example of the military\u0027s determination to eliminate all opposition and suffocate freedoms in Myanmar, said Amnesty deputy regional director for Campaigns Ming Yu Hah.The court\u0027s farcical and corrupt decision is part of a devastating pattern of arbitrary punishment that has seen more than 1,300 people killed and thousands arrested since the military coup in February.The UN rights chief also slammed the Myanmar junta over the conviction and demanded her release.The conviction of the State Counsellor following a sham trial in secretive proceedings before a military-controlled court is nothing but politically-motivated, Michelle Bachelet said in a statement.She added that the conviction closes another door to political dialogue in Myanmar and will only deepen rejection of the coup.Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, struck a more cautious tone, saying : As a friendly neighbour, we sincerely hope that all parties in Myanmar will proceed from the long-term interests of the country, bridge their differences under the constitutional and legal framework, and continue to advance the hard-earned democratic transition suitable for Myanmar’s national conditions.Her detention and the overturning of the civilian government sparked nationwide protests that have been brutally suppressed, with demonstrators killed on the streets, detained and tortured. More than 1,300 civilians have been killed since the coup, according to a local activist group. On Sunday, an army vehicle ploughed into a peaceful anti-government march in the commercial capital, Yangon, reportedly killing at least five people. The incident was caught on video and shared on social media, showing the speeding truck mowing down marchers from behind. Witnesses revealed about soldiers then jumped out, opened fire and gave chase. The United Nations in Myanmar condemned the incident and the US embassy said it was “horrified.”But the junta has been attacking civilians with impunity across the country since the coup, with multiple reports of troops launching killing sprees and torching properties. The UN has said hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes due to violent crackdowns across the country, with more than 220,000 currently internally displaced. In late November, civilians were reportedly killed in airstrikes and helicopter attacks on villages in Depayin Township, northwest Myanmar, as the junta battled with insurgent groups. An eyewitness told the  at least four residents were killed during airstrikes on Nyaung Hla village, the third such attack since September. “Five military helicopters arrived and one fired from the sky for about ten minutes as the military was unable to advance on the ground,” said the witness. “Soldiers used a machine gun from the helicopter.” Heavy artillery was also used against the village, which is now occupied, its residents in hiding.  Ms Suu Kyi’s trial has also taken place against a background of economic and humanitarian crisis.The UN predicts nearly half the 54 million population will be living in poverty by early next year – roughly double the number from five years ago – because of the economic slump triggered by the pandemic and the coup. More than five million children could require life-saving humanitarian aid to survive next year, Save the Children warned last week. Threats of widespread starvation have been building as the junta blocks access roads and cuts off communities’ food and medical supplies. The Special Advisory Council for Myanmar, a body of international experts, has warned that repeated military offensives have prevented farmers in the northwest and east from planting and harvesting their yearly rice crops which are the main source of local food supply. More from NewsTravel news latest: Fury grows within travel industry after U-turn on pre-departure tests Coronavirus latest news: Boris Johnson insists new omicron travel rules were not too little too lateBoris mustn\u0026#39t underestimate the challenge from Reform UKPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson vows to ruin Christmas for county lines gangsPrince Harry brands cash for honours row involving Charles\u0026#39s foundation \u0026#39CBE scandal\u0026#39The Government is right: judges have become too powerful More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"girl can retire 15 after","story":"Girl can retire at  after starting toy business that made £k in a monthPixie Curtis, from Sydney, Australia, also has a hair accessories firm - Pixies Bows - under her name despite still being at primary school Image: roxyjacenko InstagramByBradley JollyNews Wire:,  Dec | comments A -year-old girl can effectively retire in just five years after launching a toy business which made a whopping £, last month.

Storm Arwen toppled the large Christmas tree in Audlem, Cheshire, just hours after the villageaposs lights were switched on last week.One villager, who saw the drama unfold and helped keep people safe, said: The lights switch on was brilliant there were lots of people out, but the winds started to get up just as people were leaving. We were sat in the pub at around .pm when we got a shout to say the tree had gone down outside, so we all helped to move it.

Mr Raab, who is also Justice Secretary, said while the reports were based on unsubstantiated claims all on the basis of anonymous sources,they were correct then there would have been a breach. However, he bizarrely added: They [police] don’t normally look back and investigate things that have taken place a year ago. Until there is something substantiated, until it is more than anonymous sources, I think we are chasing shadows, he told BBCaposs The Andrew Marr Show.  If there is a breach of the rules, there is a breach of the rules. But I donapost know the full facts because I wasnapost there. Of course,there was a formal party held, of course that is something that is clearly contrary to the guidance. If anyone held a party that is contrary to the rules, of course that is the wrong thing to do. If something unsubstantiated from anonymous sources actually materialised, then of course it would be wrong. His intervention will pile pressure on Mr Johnson to come clean over the festive celebration. Writing exclusively for the Mirror, Shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens said our revelations last week “made my blood boil”.

Emergency laws were brought in again last week until December  in a bid to help slow the spread of the new Omicron iant.But it is thought the laws around wearing masks in shops and on public transport will be in place longer - until January - with sources sayng it is likely masks would be mandatory for at least another three weeks in order to give scientists more time to analyse the Omicron threat. Regulations around travel have also changed and are expected to be extended. These include pre-departure tests and a compulsory ten-day quarantine for anyone in close contact with an Omicron case. At the same time, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is trying to reassure Brits that Christmas is still on and the government wonapost enforce its Plan B just yet, according to sources.A Whitehall source told MailOnline: aposIn terms of Plan B, we are not there yet. The ambition is that people can have a much more normal Christmas than last year. aposThat depends on what the data shows about the new iant. But certainly the hope is that things stay as they are in the next couple of weeks.aposDeputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has also been urging people to continue with their plans for Christmas, adding that it was aposgoing to be a great Christmasapos.He told Brits yesterday to “enjoy Christmas” but “continue to be vigilant”, adding: “I think it’s going to be a great Christmas. All the family, friends, loved ones being able to get together in a way we haven’t been able to do for a couple of years is really important.”  He also urged people to get their booster jabs as soon as they can, saying it was the most important measure in helping to stop further restrictions coming into force. Meanwhile a member of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciessuggested restrictions could still be needed in January. Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter, of the University of Cambridge, said Omicron “may actually be milder but we havenapost got enough data yet to be able to say”. Speaking to Sky News the statistician added: “Just like last year with the Alpha iant, this is a terrible time for a iant to come along. “The next two weeks are probably some of the highest-risk periods with a lot of indoor socialising that we know is extremely high risk. “It’s appalling timing. I’m sure the government would love not to disrupt Christmas. What happens after Christmas of course is another matter.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Plan BBoris JohnsonPublic transportPoliticsFace Masks\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The words yesterday from Cambridge University statistician Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter rang alarm bells about the potential impact of Christmas socialising. Continued contradictory messages from a rule-breaking Prime Minister on both parties and socialising is heightening concern as the coronavirus spreads, including an Omicron iant worrying virologists. And when vaccines are the main line of Britain’s defence in this pandemic, Boris Johnson’s failure to mobilise a national jabbing programme to match the huge effort earlier this year is a lethal and expensive blunder.

Yet children continue to die after facing the most horric and unthinkable cruelty. Increasing already y prison sentences may assuage public anger and deliver what many would applaud as tougher justice.

The intended insult comes amid high tension between the West and Russia, and follows the Tory minister’s blunt warning to the Kremlin against making a “strategic mistake by invading Ukraine. Moscow reacted to her “provocative” images atop a British army Challenger  tank close to the Russian border in Estonia. One broadcaster even appeared to question her sanity with an offensive slur mentioning her mental health.  Footage from state-controlled Channel  shows presenter Anatoly Kuzichev informing his viewers: There is a new Iron Lady in British politics. UK Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss had a ride on a tank in Estonia. During joint drills in the Baltics, Truss claimed she wants a world where democracies prosper - not just survive. Apparently a tank ride, even , promotes prosperity. The broadcast used avideo showing Truss but overlaid it with the music Entry of the Gladiators by the Czech composer Julius Fucik, a melody associated with circuses - to introduce the clowns.The attack came on TV talk show Vremya Pokazhet -translated into English as Time Will Tell . In , hardline Soviet newspaper Red Star branded Tory leader Margaret Thatcher the “Iron Lady” but the author military journalist Yuri Gavrilov later admitted his planned biting insult had spectacularly backfired. A week after the publication, Thatcher told a constituency event: ”I stand before you tonight in my Red Star evening gown, my face softly made up and my fair hair gently waved, the Iron Lady of the Western world. She was delighted, she said,the tag Iron Lady was how the Soviets wish to interpret my defence of values and freedoms fundamental to our way of le”.Three years later she swept to power in her historic  General Election victory, making her the UKaposs first female Prime Minister.Diehard communist Gavrilov’s aim had been to “cut her down to size”, he said after his retirement, but the opposite happened.I thought - aposKnight in Skirts but it sounded too clumsy, he said. Racking his brains, the Iron Chancellor - Germanyaposs Otto von Bismarck - came to mind. Finally, I thought of aposIron Ladyapos - and the rest is history. I hit the nail right on its head, didnapost I ”Kuzichev suggested the images of Truss on a tank were an upgrade on Boris Johnson at the Peppa Pig “fun fair”.Another presenter on the show Artyom Sheynin ed to the tank theme in describing the Truss trip to Estonia. Things got a bit too much for the British foreign secretary, who said aposleave me aloneapos, jumped into a tank and started driving towards the Russian border,” he said.  Of course, she was stopped by the Estonians, barely after  metres. You know, who knows what she might have done ” His rant went on: ”I can understand that her nerves are giving way. She probably doesnapost know herself whataposs going on. “First, thereaposs war, then there isnapost, first [the Russians] are massing forces, then theyaposre not. Nothing is clear. And this is the same girl who was concerned about stability on the European continent. Official Kremlin daily newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta also mocked the Foreign Secretary’s tank ride. The Englishwoman was unable to come up with anything better than to ride around in the Baltics - in the immediate vicinity of Russia’s border - in a British Challenger  tank and make new threats against Moscow, it stated. The Moscow reaction seems to show Ms Truss cutting through with the Russians. She had warned Putin over Ukraine: “We have seen this playbook from the Kremlin before when Russia ly claimed its illegal annexation of Crimea was a response to Nato aggression. “Nato is an alliance forged on the principle of defence, not provocation. Any suggestion that Nato is provoking the Russians is clearly . “Any action by Russia to undermine the freedom and democracy that our partners enjoy would be a strategic mistake.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyLiz TrussPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Policing Minister Kit Malthouse said it was likely there were some lestyle users among the thousands of people working in the Palace of Westminster. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has vowed to contact the police after reports that traces of cocaine had been found in numerous sites in Parliament. Only one of  lavatory areas tested showed traces of cocaine, according to a probe by the Sunday Times.The claims come as Boris Johnson was poised to unveil its -year drugs strategy for England and Wales, in potentially awkward timing for the Government. The plan includes a police crackdown to cut off the supply of class A drugs by city-based crime rings to the surrounding county areas - known as county lines. The PM also suggested it could include removing the passports and driving licences of offenders, as the Government targets middle class users. Askedsome of his own colleagues could be hit by proposals to remove the passports and driving licences of offenders, Mr Malthouse told Sky News: I hope not. There are obviously several thousand people who work on the estate and I would be surprisedthere werenapost some lestyle users of drugs amongst them.But we want to do is get to a place where police and other authorities are concentrating as much as the part of the drugs industry as they are on crack and heroin.Mr Malthouse also backed plans by Sir Lindsay to use snfer dogs to stamp out drug use in Westminster. On Sunday, the Commons Speaker said: The accounts of drug misuse in Parliament given to the Sunday Times are deeply concerning, and I will be raising them as a priority with the politan Police next week. I expect to see full and effective enforcement of the law. While Parliament provides extensive support services for any staff or Members who may need help with drug misuse - and I would encourage anyone struggling with such issues to take up such help - for those who choose to flout the law and bring the institution into disrepute the sanctions are serious. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said it was right that the reports had been referred to the police. She told Sky News: Itaposs not something Iaposve ever seen but I think the Speaker of the House of Commons is absolutely right to say this has to be referred to the politan Police. You canapost have an institution thataposs supposed to be law-making and in fact have within it so much law-breaking, so I think itaposs absolutely right that this is properly investigated.

Sometimes, the Maxim model just receives abuse from trolls who donapost like what she does for a living. After putting up with the messages for long enough, Paige decided to hit back and set up another Instagram page, @dudesinthedm - which now has , followers. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here On this account, she shares the lewd, sleazy messages sent to her by men she doesnapost know - including toe-curling chat up lines. One more recent attempt to win her affections compared her to a Christmas turkey - which she didnapost take kindly to. In another series of messages, one troll slams her for looking undateable and low class. Paige responds: I am undateable and low class - giving her troll absolutely nothing to come back with. Her followers found her responses hilarious, admiring her straight-talking approach to people who try to tear her down.  One follower said: “These make me snort regularly.” “This account brings me joy! Why do random men think we care about their options !” another commented.

Paige simply responded: And I hope you get kidney stones. The person accused her of going too far in her response, but Paigeaposs followers praised her answer and assured her that he had started it.  After receiving an unsolicited nude photo of a man who wanted to catch her attention, Paige responded: Hey there little guyyy [sic]. Other, creepier messages from so-called aposfansapos made gross suggestions about farting and other bodily s - which Paige decided not to respond to. Followers responded by joking the men were so romantic while others said they were worse than just unpleasant. In one particularly shocking exchange, a man admits he called her an ugly w***e who sells her body on the internet. Despite his vitriolic outburst, he demanded to know why heaposd been blocked from her main page. Paige posted the screenshot of the message with the caption: aposI love men without the n.apos In another shocking exchange, a follower asks why they have been blocked from her main page.

The endangered species is protected in  countries – but in South Africa it is legal to hunt tigers bred in captivity.Big-game hunter Adrian de Guisti told our undercover reporter it was “big business” and offered to pay “good commission” for finding British clients. But the practice is highly controversial and secretive, and he said he would be “burned on social media”it got out. De Guisti, who runs Gotsoma Safaris in Free State Province, said: “I have all five of the dferent tigers. I have Bengal, Siberian, the white, I’ve got the snow tiger, tabby tiger... “I started breeding with tigers in South Africa in . I’m currently charging US, [£,] for an adult tiger.” It is thought , tigers live in over  breeding facilities in South Africa. Some are sent to zoos and private collectors but, with tiger parts highly prized in traditional Chinese medicine, they are worth more dead than alive. It is feared many end up being shot for trophies and their body parts illegally exported to Asia. Our reporter spoke to De Guisti after we found he had posted, and then deleted, a photo on his website of a dead tiger next to a hunting bow. Big-game hunting in Africa is increasingly popular among wealthy Chinese customers and our reporter posed as a hunter with clients keen to kill a tiger.  De Guisti said: “I am a specialist in exotics and a specialist in big-game hunting. I only do Big Five [lion, leopard, rhino, elephant and African buffalo] and I then discuss additional trophies with the clients, but there’s a matter of trust that’s got to be bought first.”He told us to book a “simple” hunting safari for a lion or buffalo and went on: “You come with your clients. We sit around the table. I tell you what I can do. I put my cards on the table, you put your money on the table, then it’s game on.” He was nervous that we were calling from the UK, saying: “% of our trouble regarding big cats comes from Britain. “If this call is recorded I’m going to be burned for it on social media. Butit’s a genuine situation we can definitely do business. You did find pictures of me hunting tigers… I’m not denying it.” De Guisti admitted his business breeding lions, tigers, leopards and jaguars is dependent on income from hunting. He said: “No photographic safaris can create income for a guy like me in my business. It’s only the hunters’ money that does make it happen.”Hunting captive tigers is allowed in South Africa, though some states require a permit. But they must not be “bred for trade in their parts and derivatives”, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species says. De Guisti insisted that what he did was “totally legal”.He added: “You can’t really export the tiger bones but they can exportthem as lion bones. You’ve got to be a specialist to see the dference.” Fiona Miles of animal welfare charity Four Paws said: “We cannot stand by and allow the commercial trade of big cats to continue and a silent acceptance of this abuse to be perpetuated. “Otherwise the reality of animals living behind bars – or worse still only as trinkets to be shown off – will become all too real.”Asked for a response to our investigation, Mr de Guisti said: “I told you what you wanted to hear. I don’t even have tigers.”He refused to comment on the photo with the dead tiger and bow.

Yang Guang and Tian Tian have been unable to breed at Edinburgh Zoo since their arrival in  - sparking fears among activists that they will be seen as useless following the end of their decade-long, £,-a-year lease deal. The pair have been in the zoo for  years and came to Scotland to be part of a breeding program.John Robins, of the charity Animal Concern, told The Scottish Sun: I have real concerns thatthey go back to China they could end up on the dissection table.“They are only of real value to the Chinese as a breeding couple.  He speculated they would be opened up and assessed to find out why they failed to produce offspring. He added: It might be the only sensible thing is for the Scottish Government to give them political asylum and not send them back.”Mr Robins said the animals have done nothing but suffer.It costs the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland £, a month to care for the pandas - whose names mean Sunshine and Sweetie. Income for the charity that runs the zoo was more than £million in  but plummeted to £m last year because of the Covid- pandemic.  Yang Guang was castrated three years age and attempts to articially inseminate Tian Tian has been unsuccessful. RZSS chief exec David Field said: “We remain in discussions with our colleagues in China about Yang Guang and Tian Tian’s future at Edinburgh Zoo. We still hope to extend their stay and will keep everyone updated.” Iain Valentine, the zoo’s former director of animals, conservation and education, said the pandaaposs stay here “has been a huge success for the society and has had a big economic impact for Scotland”. He insisted the pair have not suffered andthey go back to China they would likely end up in a “retiral home for older pandas”. A Scottish Government spokesman said the issue is between RZSS and China Wildle Conservation Association to make a decision.

Most mornings thereaposs a massive fight between Charlotte and George as to what song is played. And I have to, now, basically prioritise that one day someone does this one, and another day itaposs someone aposs turn.  So, George gets his go, then Charlotte gets her go. Such is the clamour for the music. He added: Itaposs a really happy moment where the children just enjoy dancing, messing around, and singing. The prince has shared his kidsapos favourite song to listen to. The future King continued: One of the songs that the children are loving at the moment is Shakira, Waka Waka. Thereaposs a lot of hip movements!  He said he is also a huge fan of Shakira because of her environmental campaigning and asked the pop star to be a member of his Earthshot Prize Council. Prince William said at the time: Shakira was my number one person on the list. We tried to get people who genuinely cared for the environment, but were also influences around the world and Shakira has been brilliant at highlighting the plight of the oceans.  Prince William also shared how his childrenaposs love of music comes from him. He revealed his favourite song on Monday mornings is the head-banging AC DC track Thunderstruck. He said the single, released by the Australian rock band in , is his best tonic to begin a new working week. He said: Thereaposs nothing better than, on a Monday morning, when youaposre a bit bleary-eyed after the weekend and trying to get yourself back into the grind of the week, listening to AC DC - Thunderstruck. It absolutely wakes you up, puts your week in the best mood possible, and you feel like you can take on anything and anyone. William added: I’d imagine you’re going to walk quite fast listening to it, maybe with a skip in your step, with the head-banging. It’s a dficult song not to dance to or to nod along to. He also said he often listens to Tina Turneraposs  cover of Bonnie Tyleraposs The Best.He added that the song reminds him of a real family moment driving to school with his mum Diana and his brother Prince Harry.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Prince HarryPrince GeorgePrincess CharlottePrince WilliamRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jamie Fuller thought he had all the permissions he needed to top , tonnes of hardcore on a field. The -year-old father of three didnapost know he needed the submit a planning application.Now Jamie, from Llanelli, Wales, faces an £, bill after being ordered to remove the scaffolding yard, WalesOnline reports. He says he has already spent around £, on the project and believes bankruptcy is likely. Jamie said: Iaposm gutted. Itaposs jeopardised the future of my three children. I want to give them the best possible le I can. This will leave me having to sign on.  I feel I will be stuck in a council house for the rest of my le and Iaposm going to be left with nothing. For four years I built up my scaffolding business, working long hours and weekends. I feel like it was all for nothing. Jamie, who employs two scaffolders, bought the disused land from his grandfather Gerald in June  as a base for his business. He said: I thought itaposs paid for, itaposs mine, nobody can tell me what to do and Iaposve no worry of having to leave. It was great. My plan was to build a house there in the future. That was my dream.  The original access point to the site was the same one for my grandfatheraposs house. I didnapost want to cause him problems or depreciate the value of his property by sharing access, so I created a new access point. Jamie applied to Natural Resources Walesfor the right to tip hardcore to level the field, which he described as a flytipping hotspot disused for decades.He said: The land had been all overgrown and I cut it back. It was a bog, a hell of a mess, with a bit of a stream going down the side. There were tyres and fridges and dead animals and rats. You name it, it was there. I must have taken  dumped tyres away. NRW granted an exemption for the dad to use waste materials in construction. He started tipping hardcore and rubble to build a driveway and hardstanding for the scaffolding yard, with a layer of crushed stone on top to make it tidy. In September , the access was in place but Jamie was still laying the yardaposs surface. He says he was then visited by representatives of Carmarthenshire Council and NRW. He said: It panicked me a bit. They were saying their biggest concern was the access. I asked what I needed to do. They said I needed planning permission for access but didnapost mention anything about [tipping for the surface of the yard].  I had lorries coming in and tipping rubble at the time. They could see we were tipping that day and didnapost say anything about it. There was no stop notice for the tipping. He put in a retrospective planning application for the access but says he did not hear from the council until March  telling him he had to block the access, remove the scaffolding and get rid of everything . Jamie appealed but it was rejected. He said: The price to remove all the hardcore will be around £,. Firms are afraid of damaging the road so Iaposm struggling to find anyone to remove it.  The planning inspectorate has said it canapost take personal circumstances into consideration because Iaposve broken planning law which I didnapost know about. Iaposm worried Iaposm going to have bailfs on my door. If it comes to it Iaposm going to have to sell all my equipment to pay for removal. He is now worried about how this affects the future of his children, eight-year-old Jake, four-year-old Thea and two-year-old Indi. The planning inspectorate explained its decision to reject Jamieaposs appeal, writing in its report that the development has signicantly altered and harmed the rural character and appearance of the immediate area. The report also raises safety concerns. It says the access is not perpendicular to the main road, adding: The visibility in both directions from the access is restricted and it is likely that vehicles exiting the site would have to edge out onto the highway to gain visibility. NRW confirmed its waste regulation team had been in regular contact with Jamie up to the work becoming a planning issue which was then led by the council. Senior waste regulation officer David Ellar said: Mr Fuller did not have a permit for this work, he had registered an exemption with NRW. Exemptions are for low-risk waste operations that are exempt from needing an environmental permit but still require the holder to operate within specied limits and conditions. Registering an exemption does not remove the need to apply for other permits or permissions. Waste exemptions must be registered with us before the activity commences. “We de-registered Mr Fuller’s exemption when planning permission was refused by the planning authority at Carmarthenshire Council as the activity was not authorised.” A council spokeswoman added: Before anyone starts a development of any type we strongly recommend that they contact the local planning authority so that they can be advised of what permissions may be required. Having a permit from another body for depositing waste materials on a site does not constitute planning permission.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON property news\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterSubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The mum-of-five, from North Wales, underwent tests and MRI scans to try and find the cause of her symptomsLeah Smith before her diagnosis Image: Family handoutByLaura SharmanFreelance writerCharlotte Hadfield:,  Dec | commentsA mother has been stuck in bed for five years after suffering stroke-like symptoms completely out of the blue. Leah Smith, , has to lie flat and often experiences seizures and numbness around her body. The mum-of-five, from North Wales, underwent tests and MRI scans to try and find the cause of her symptoms after her first episode in . Mum Debbie, , was sat next to Leah when she first took a turn for the worse.It was like an altered consciousness, I could see she wasnapost herself, she told the Echo.She looked a bit vacant, she was able to speak but I would see she wasnapost completely with us so I rang an ambulance. In the weeks that followed, Leah began feeling numbness in her legs and underwent a lumbar puncture to check for multiple sclerosis .  Doctors later discovered that the lumbar puncture had caused a Cerebrospinal fluid leakDespite having procedures to try and fix it, which gave Leah temporary pain relief and allowed her to sit up for an hour at a time, they ultimately proved unsuccessful. She has since been diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndromes- a group of rare inherited conditions that affect connective tissue - and Arachnoiditis. The pain disorder is caused by inflammation of the membranes that surround and protect the nerves of the spinal cord, which leads to chronic pain and neurological problems. In the last five years, Leah has only left her home to attend hospital appointments and this is done with extreme dficulty and the help of a lie down wheelchair. Debbie said: Sheaposs got a lie down wheelchair that she canapost even use at the moment because sheaposs in that much pain everywhere, sowe can get rid of some of the pain and she can get back in that wheelchair, sheaposll get stronger. Her muscles and everything are deteriorating, Debbie said.  The deterioration of her in the last  months is exponential. Sheaposs getting weaker and weaker and in more pain. Since her diagnosis, Leahaposs family have been fighting to get her the help she needs but they fear time is running out. She needs multiple lesaving operations which Debbie said are only available through private healthcare. However, specialist doctors in Germany and England may be able to help her. In the meantime, she has round the clock care including from carers, specialised doctors and hospital procedures. A Gofundme page has been set up with the aim of raising enough money for the operations and specialist transport for Leah. Debbie said: Itaposs devastating that you feel that youaposre in this condition and youaposve had to fight to the extent weaposve had to fight to find out the reasons of whataposs going on. And to try and fight to get help to find out the help is only available with specialists you have to pay for.

Katie Dean says there have been problems since they moved into the house in Hull in September . Images from inside show plaster peeling off walls, a hole in one ceiling, as well as extensive damp and mould. The mum claims that her -year-old daughter moved out because she was too embarrassed to live there.Katie, who lives in the house with her partner, toddler child and with a baby on the way, told HullLive: Itaposs not liveable. My key worker from Target Housing has been and Iaposve told him I want moving out of the property, itaposs seriously affecting my mental health. My -year-old has moved out of the house to live with her dad, partly because it was too embarrassing to bring people around. She is also worried about her toddler, who she claims is getting chest infections. Katie, who is in her s, said Target Housing has responded to her and that some repairs have been attempted. The repairs included the replacement of a boiler  days after the previous version packed up, the fitting of a dormer window, an extractor fan and a new radiator installed in the bathroom.  However, Katie claims itaposs barely scratched the surface of all the houseaposs signicant issues. She says that work to insulate the roof and prevent a leak in the attic had not been effective. She said: Weaposve actually now found that it is still leaking and the roof is all damp and wet. Itaposs disgusting - itaposs actually growing mould on it and I canapost get rid of it.  I had a new window fitted, a new dormer window, thataposs brilliant. But the mould above it must be because of a leak and itaposs like growing. Katie claims a new radiator that was fitted in the bathroom led to signicant damage to the wall beside it, which she was still waiting for to be repaired. She further claimed that the issues with the houseaposs living room - damp walls, the adjacent hallway wall falling through and being too cold - are so extensive that the family had effectively abandoned using it.  She said: I mean, my living room was beautul. I adore ornaments because thataposs what Iaposm into. And I canapost use none of it because it would just end up on the floor smashed and broken because of the walls and things. She added: This was only to be temporary until I got my money, finances, things like that, sorted out.  She added they were moved in with the assistance of Target Housing and were paying back prior rent arrears to the council. Members of Hull City Councilaposs environmental health team have also visited the property two times, Katie said. She added: Andthey canapost work around us doing that, then move us out.

In a rare interview in , Angela Kelly even ulged that the Queen mimics her Liverpudlian accent. She said: We have a lot of fun together. The Queen has a wicked sense of humour and is a great mimic.She can do all accents — including mine.  Angela, who was the daughter of a dockworker in Liverpool, was given The Queenaposs support for her tell-all book - The Other Side of The Coin: The Queen, The Dresser and the Wardrobe. The decision to support the book is unprecedented, proving just how highly regarded she is by the Queen.After starting in  as a dresser, Angela is now solely responsible for how Her Majesty looks in public and has even made several of her most memorable looks.

And who knows, maybe Angela is busy at work making some outfits for the Queen to wear this Christmas Thataposs because the monarch has told her family she is well enough to host Christmas at Sandringham this month after recovering from a back sprain. The -year-old assured them she is feeling “far better” and is “looking forward” to the traditional festive get together at her Norfolk estate.  Concern for the Queen’s health has been heightened in recent weeks after she pulled out of a number of major engagements. But a source said: “The Queen has told everyone she is feeling far better of late and is very much looking forward to welcoming them for Christmas. “Like many other families, this will be the first time Her Majesty can gather with her extended family after being kept apart for so long due to the coronavirus pandemic.” Royal fans will be hoping toto the estate on Christmas Day to catch a glimpse of the royals as they walk en masse to and from the th Century St Mary Magdalene Church on the Sandringham property. The Queen is said to be “determined” to attend church with the rest of the family, but will as in previous years be driven to the church to save her walking the short distance.Christmas guests will include Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their three children.

This week Emma Tustin, , was sentenced to le with a minimum term of  years for killing her six-year-old step-son. While in remand during the trial, she shared a cell with a prisoner called Elaine for six weeks at Eastwood Park prison, Gloucestershire. The former cellmate claimed that the murderous step-mum never once mentioned Arthur or his death. Arthuraposs father, Thomas Hughes, , was sentenced to  years for manslaughter - but Tustin was said to have been upset that he was cold to her during their trial. “She always felt sorry for herself, Elaine told the Sunday Mirror.  One day she came back from a plea hearing and was upset, so I asked, ‘What’s wrong ’ “She said, ‘He didn’t look at me, Tom never looked at me’. That was the only time I saw her upset about anything.” Elaine had been recalled to jail for battery and criminal damage. She said Tustin used to “laugh and joke” on the phone.  Elaine claimed the mum of four told her own mother she would never see her grandchildren again unless she retracted statements about Arthur. She only discovered the truth about the charges Tustin was facing when she found and read her case paperwork. “We had a fight – it was me more than her. I got angry because I’d read about how he [Arthur] had  bruises and I asked how she wouldn’t notice when she gave him a bath, she added. “She said she just used to give him a towel.  “I pressed the bell and saidthe prison officers didn’t get her out then I’d be staying there a long time.” Tustin was moved to a dferent cell. But Elaine said after inmates learned how Tustin poisoned Arthur with salt, they laced her meals with it. She said: “Some of the things we did were cruel – but she was crueller to Arthur so she deserved it.”  Today dozens of residents paid a touching tribute to Arthur outside the house in Solihull where he was killed. Organised by a local resident, the vigil saw people laying flowers, holding balloons and placing posters and banners paying tribute to Arthur at the property. His maternal grandmother Madeleine Halcrow could be seen wiping away tears at the vigil while wearing a T-shirt bearing his face. The crowd lined the road before letting go of the balloons, some bearing messages, and applauding. Residents, some with tears in their eyes, could be heard saying bye Arthur and fly high always. They then formed a line outside the house before balloons, posters and flowers were placed around the property.  The words You are loved Arthur were put on the boarded-up window. A Birmingham City flag was also placed at the scene, along with a picture of Arthur. The Government has announced a major review into the circumstances which led to the murder, aiming to determine what improvements are needed by the agencies that came into contact with Arthur before his death. The National Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panel will lead the review and will provide additional support to Solihull Childrenaposs Safeguarding Partnership. It emerged in court the boy had been seen by social workers just two months before his death, but they concluded there were no safeguarding concerns.

For others, it brings money worries, and having to make the tough decision as to whether to heat their home, or eat their next meal. Four years ago, Debi Emmett decided to take action and do something to alleviate the stress for pet owners who found themselves in hard times, by setting up a pet food bank service.And this year alone, she’s provided , meals to animals across South Wales, up , the previous year.The -year-old said: “A friend told me about dog’s homes being overrun with elderly dogs because everyone wanted puppies. I thought it was terrible, and as it’s usually older people who adopt older dogs, these are the kinds of people who already struggle with the heat or eating issue. “But these dogs are their worlds and in order to keep them on sofas and out of shelters, we started up the pet food bank.”  Debi, from Cardf, started the charity solo, and would collect and deliver pet food in the area, but Covid- brought new challenges, changing the way the food bank operated. Instead, she began delivering to other food banks with established users, who were elated to discover that there was dog food in their food parcels. Debi’s heart broke when she heard a story from one woman who was struggling financially, and resorted to feeding her dog pasta. The charity founder said: “One lady said ‘I have nothing in the house so I fed my dog pasta - I know it’s no good for them but it’s all I had’.

The pet food bank service helps people in financial crises, the homeless, and throughout the pandemic, many furloughed workers.  The -year-old added: “It’s not just homeless people we help. In the pandemic there were airline pilots who thought they had a job for le, suddenly found themselves out of work and lost all their income. “It’s not necessarily people who can’t afford their animals, it’s people who found themselves in a dficult situation through no fault of their own.” And Christmas is set to be an incredibly busy time for Debi, who spends up to  hours a week collecting and delivering food to outlets in Cardf, Newport, Caerphilly, Swansea, Gilfach Goch, Merthyr and Bargoed. But after a year like no other, it’s set to be a festive season like no other for the charity, too, with Debi expecting more and more demand for pet food throughout December.

She said: “We have provided more than , meals for pets this year, and the sad part is, that could have easily been doubledwe weren’t restricted by our storage size. “Normally in November and December we don’t get asked for that much food, instead people are donating it because they’re feeling generous, and then it gets sent out to families in January. “But this year we’re expecting a lot of people in need of our service at Christmas, and we need that generosity to continue so we have enough food for December, January and February.” As well as pet food, Debi also collects coats for homeless dogs, as well as leads, collars, harnesses and blankets for pet owners who might need them. The animal lover - who has a rescue French bulldog, called Ruby - hopes to open a café in the future, complete with doggy play area and extra storage, where service users will be able to socialise. She added: “Next year I’m looking to start fundraising for a café, but property in Cardf is quite expensive. If we can do it, hopefully it means we could double what we’re doing now.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeamDogsDogsFather ChristmasAnimalsHomelessness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And one couple has made the Christmas wish of an adorable three-legged whippet puppy named Roo come true, as they’ve given her a forever home just in time for the big day. Roo was born with just one front leg and at two months old her previous owners gave her to the Blue Cross charity because they didn’t have time to care for her. The pooch was placed into foster care to adapt to a home environment and after being put up for adoption, she was quickly snapped up by her new owners, Amanda and Steve Hofford.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The couple, from Basingstoke, Hampshire, lost their beloved basset hound Mabel just after last Christmas and say Roo has helped fill the void in their lives. Amanda said: We had never been without a dog for  years so to say that we all felt the loss was an understatement. All our previous six dogs had been rescue dogs, so it was a no brainer to rescue again. When we saw her on the Blue Cross website, she was absolutely adorable. We read her story and knew we had to try to adopt her. The whole process and understanding to our situation was amazing.  She was a much wanted and needed addition to our family. Everyone she meets and greets falls in love with her. She is so funny, inquisitive, loving, lively and we wouldnapost be without her. Roo quickly settled into le in her forever home, and she doesn’t let her disability stop her from doing everything a four-legged dog would do. And Amanda says the adorable pooch loves nothing more than cuddling up on the sofa with her new owners, making friends with other dogs in the park and playing with her toys. The woman added: When Roo came to us she had been so wonderfully taken care of by her foster family and Blue Cross that she was a delight. She settled straight away on the first day, it was like she had lived here her whole little le. She has a front leg missing but this is no obstacle to her at all. She runs around, flies up and down the stairs and does absolutely everything a four-legged dog would do. Absolutely nothing stops her, we often forget she has a leg missing as this has never been an issue. We have had to make no accommodations to her being three legged because she takes her whole le in her stride and lives it to the full.Anyone wishing to adopt an animal from the Blue Cross or wishing to make a donation to the charity can visit: https:www.bluecross.org.uk christmas.Have you got a hopeful story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The large Ursidae was spotted in Minnesota on a nature trailaposs cameras and immediately impressed with its hefty size. Footage of the four legged mammal shows its stomach almost touching the ground as it takes each step.The bear was caught on film just south of the Voyageurs National Park in northern Minnesota on October , Fox  reported.“This might be THE fattest bear we have ever seen in our area!” the Facebook account for the project posted along with the video on December . “How much do you think this porker weighs ! Unfortunately, we only got one video of this beauty but it is enough to appreciate the bear’s curves and figure...it worked hard for that body. “We are still going through trail camera footage from this past summer and fall where we are finding and trying to share some gems like this. “With the number of cameras we have out, it takes quite an effort to get through all of the footage.” The signicant heft of the bear led some to question whether it was unnaturally large. “Is he ok  Are they supposed to get this big ” one viewer asked. Others suggested it had found itself a source of human food with particularly high fat content. Steph Horner, of the Vince Shute Wildle Sanctuary, said the bear was completely fine. Bears in northern Minnesota try to gain  to  per cent of their weight since they hibernate and may not eat for  to  months,” she added. “I suspect he’s actually a bear from my sanctuary in Orr and managed to find additional food sources after we closed for the season.”  Some viewers thought the Minnesota bear could rival the winner of Fat Bear Week put on by Alaskaaposs Katmai National Park. In  a salmon chomping beast was crowned the winner of the competition.  - who is named after the famously large plane - scooped the prestigious gong during Alaska’s annual battle of the heavyweights. The bear, one of more than , brown bears roaming Alaska’s Katmai National Park and Preserve, was victorious on Tuesday after a week of frenzied online voting. Winner  was a worthy champion, the park said in a statement. “This year he really packed on the pounds, looking like he was fat enough to hibernate in July and yet continuing to eat until his belly seemed to drag along the ground by late September,” the park said.

She had even added a heart-eyed emoji. It was good to see Sydney happy. Her loved ones knew she’d struggled with depression, but she was always trying to stay positive. A tattoo on her arm read, “Everything will be wonderful someday.” And her new romance was making her feel hopeful. It was  November  and Sydney lived in Lincoln, Nebraska, where she worked as a cashier at a hardware store. Her parents, George and Susie, lived three hours away, but they would get together as often as they could and messaged each other constantly. Sydney had told her friends that she’d met a woman called Audrey on Tinder. She’d even shared Audrey’s picture with them. She had been on one date with Audrey two days earlier – where they had simply driven around getting to know each other. Now it was time for the second date and she headed out.  But the next morning, Sydney didn’t turn up for work. She wasn’t ing messages from her parents, so they got in their car and drove straight to her apartment. They found Sydney’s cat Mimzy hungry and abandoned and knew something bad had happened. Sydney would never have neglected her cat. Her car was still there and her mobile was turned off. They filed a missing person’s report with the police. The last time her phone was on, it was in Wilber – about  miles away. Fears were that Sydney had been abducted and her parents made an emotional public plea for her safe . Investigators focused on Sydney’s date, Audrey, and tracked down her phone number after linking with her on Tinder. The woman who answered admitted going on a date with Sydney, but said she’d left her at a friend’s house afterwards. She couldn’t recall where that was. Police noted that Audrey was reluctant to share basic details about herself. Eventually, officers discovered that “Audrey” was a woman called Bailey Boswell, then . She lived with her older boyfriend Aubrey Trail, then , in Wilber. They were both named as persons of interest. Boswell had been using a dferent mobile to send messages to Sydney and that phone, as well as Trail’s and Sydney’s, led the police to a location  miles west of Wilber. There, on  December, Sydney’s body was found. Her dismembered remains were stuffed in rubbish bags in ditches in a field near Omaha.  Sydney’s body had been cut up into  pieces – some of her organs and body parts were never found. The cause of death was suffocation and she had put up a fight in her final moments. Her earlobe was torn and she had bruising on her wrists, the back of the head and her inner thighs. She’d clearly been restrained before she was deprived of air. Investigators were certain that Boswell and Trail were involved. They turned out to be a very disturbing couple. Boswell had met Trail when he answered her online advert for massages. She had a young daughter who she had lost custody of. Trail and Boswell had a lot in common – including dark fantasies. They moved into a basement flat together in Wilber in June  and started defrauding antiques dealers. The pair enjoyed group sex with other women, who they met through Tinder. Trail told them stories about “gaining power” from killing people. Police determined that Boswell had lured Sydney into a trap and she had been murdered. There was even surveillance footage of Trail and Boswell out before Sydney’s date, where they bought tools and bleach. The pair were arrested in June  and charged with Sydney’s murder. Right from the start, Trail was a liar. He told a newspaper that Sydney had agreed to be part of a sexual fantasy with him and two other women, while Boswell was passed out on drugs in another room. It had got rough and something had become tight around Sydney’s neck. Trail also told his lawyers that he’d had a “sex party” with just Boswell and Sydney. They had all had sex but while Sydney was handcuffed, he had choked her with an electrical cord and had killed her. But even in the courtroom during the trial in , Trail would change his version of events again. The prosecutors said that the twisted couple had already planned on killing someone before finding Sydney on Tinder. Boswell would connect with the woman after she and Trail picked a target together by looking on social media. Hours before Sydney’s death, Trail and Boswell were buying the tools and supplies used to dismember her. They had even chosen Sydney as she lived  miles away from her family, hoping her disappearance wouldn’t be noticed for a while. They were wrong. Then, during proceedings, Trail grew angry at negative testimony about his girlfriend’s guilt and screamed, “Bailey is innocent and I curse you all!” before using a blade to cut his throat. Trail was taken to hospital and ended up missing most of his own trial. He ed to testy in his defence with scars on his neck. The defence said that Sydney had agreed to be filmed doing “sexual asphyxiation” infor money. But when Trail took to the stand, he shocked his own legal team by admitting that was also a lie. The killer said he had spun stories to confuse the investigators. “It was only me, Bailey and Sydney there the night Sydney died. There were no two other girls there. There was no , paid for a sexual fantasy,” Trail said. He claimed Sydney’s killing wasn’t planned, but she had been lured to the apartment by Boswell and Sydney had “freaked out”. They’d hoped she would join their sex ring and criminal activities. When she resisted, Trail killed and dismembered her with a saw to “protect” their lestyle. And the court were given a horric insight into that lestyle. Three women testied about being lured into Trail and Boswell’s sex cult via Tinder between June  and the November Sydney died. Trail said he was a vampire who could fly and read minds. He and Boswell both alleged they could gain more “powers” by killing people – even morethey tortured them first. The women would have sex with Trail and Boswell in exchange for an allowance. They also helped in the antique business scams. Trail made them call him “Daddy” and he would call Boswell “The Queen Witch”. There were strict rules about staying in touch with Trail and they spoke about being punished. If they broke rules, they would be slapped or even choked with a belt. When one woman left the sex cult, Trail had threatened to kill her familyshe told anyone. The jury took just three hours to deliberate. The couple were both found guilty of first-degree murder, criminal conspiracy to commit murder and improper disposal of human remains.  In June this year, at a sentencing for Trail in front of a three-judge , he gave a statement. He admitted he’d killed Sydney but insisted it wasn’t premeditated. He had killed her because he was worried that Sydney would go to the policehe let her go. “I won’t say I’m sorry, as that would be an insult to you after what I put you through,” Trail said to Sydney’s family. “And I won’t ask for forgiveness as I don’t believe there is such a thing. I have done some terrible things in my le, but this is the only thing I have ever done that I feel real regret about.” The judges said Trail had displayed a “cold, calculated” level of planning, pointing out that he had even bragged about the killing afterwards and joked that he had drunk Sydney’s blood. They said that dismembering her body was needless and done to satisfy his “intellectual and sexual curiosity”. Trail was given the death penalty. At Boswell’s sentencing last month, she also faced the death penalty. She begged for her le to be spared for her “daughter’s sake”. The judges said Sydney had found herself in the killers’ flat, outnumbered and unable to defend herself. “Boswell’s actions and words demonstrate that she had no regard for the le of Sydney Loofe beyond her own pleasure,” one judge said. But one judge didn’t agree on the death penalty, so Boswell was sentenced to le in prison without parole. Her legal team said they would appeal.

In the clip, filmed in Georgia, US, a huge ape-like creature can be seen lurking behind some trees, while the witness films from some distance away.The beast then stands - revealing that it is impressively tall, although in the shaky footage it is hard to tell exactly how big the animal is, as the Daily Star reports.The footage has been widely shared on social media and people are convinced it is a genuine Bigfoot sighting, and even experts seem to agree.  What do you think, is Bigfoot real  Let us know in the comments... The video was shared on Instagram by the account @cryptiduniversity which regularly uploads clips of mysterious creatures.One viewer said: Best footage Iaposve seen in a while - that thing was huge. A more sceptical-sounding viewer said: They do all sorts of things for attention down in Georgia.Seth Breedslove, a documentary maker and the man behind Small Town Monsters film production company, said the video might be a hoax but there was room for doubt.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. He said: The subject seems to be very large but the movement possibly gives away the potential for some trickery. The subject seems to be looking down at the ground as it turns indicating it might be a person in a suit who is having some dficulty judging the forest floor beneath them. It makes me think this is more than likely a hoax.  The filmmaker, whose latest documentary On The Trail of Bigfoot is now available on Amazon, added: The thing does appear to be large though, so maybe it’s real  These videos always leave us with more questions than answers.Legends of Bigfoot in the US gained momentum in  when loggers found a giant footprint in Bluff Creek, Calornia, and it became a national news story. Conspiracy theorists think there might be other hidden creatures, known as cryptids, lurking in the wilds, and among these legends are dogman, mothman, the yeti, and even Nessie the Loch Ness Monster.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

However, a few days ago, the whole family were having dinner at her sisteraposs house when she started making fun of the stupid shows she watches after she admitted sheaposd taken a look at her account.

I told her this was not okay and I don’t want her going through my preferences and then going so far as making fun of me for it, and I changed the password to the account. She called me yesterday, yelling about how I had no right to do that and calling me a b****. Now admittedly I do feel a little bad because her boyfriend technically didn’t do anything wrong. She concluded her post by asking whether she was unreasonable for changing the password, but the majority of people were on her side. The top comment with over , upvotes states that although the boyfriend did nothing wrong, her sister abused her login information. They added: It’s a privilege, not a right, and you had EVERY right to change your info. Another wrote: Screw that. You want to call me out and embarrass me in front of the family  Then you can’t have my login information. Grow up. Also, I might feel a little personal about this, because I just cut my younger sister off my Hulu and Netflix for being an a**. You insult, you don’t get to have the privilege. A third commented: You were doing her a favour essentially by allowing her boyfriend to use your account. She has no right to demand what you do with your account. It’s yours, shepay to use it.

Scout, a Labrador cross Catahoula leopard dog, shows just how much energy she has in this incredible display of athleticism and enthusiasm. The excitable dog’s reaction when she first hears the word “run” from her owner was amusing enough as she repeatedly lets out an adorable high pitched squeal. But viewers are then shown how powerful the dog is as she begins to sprint, pulling her owner along with her. As the Lab cross is first shown on camera, her owner utters the magic word and she’s off, bounding around the garden in excitement. She changes into her harness and waits impatiently at the gate for her owner, barking as she jumps.  Once the two leave the garden, Scout has to hold back just a few more seconds before she gets the signal to set off properly. But once the dog gets the go ahead, she wastes no time, instantly beginning a full sprint, dragging her owner along on a skateboard behind as she goes. The rest of the clip shows just how fast and for how long Scout can carry her owner behind her, in an impressive feat of athleticism. Scout is even careful to look back and check on her owner at every turn, showing she is caring as well as full of energy.The video was uploaded by TikTok user @thisisscout, and the clip was a huge hit on the video sharing , with over , views and over , likes.Viewers were impressed with Scout’s energy, with one user commenting: “I think she was a sled dog in a former le. She loves it!” Another commenter wrote: “I just love hearing her squeaky bark of excitement and pure joy when she first starts to pull.” A third added: “I love how your dog keeps looking back to seeyou’re still good.”Scout isn’t the only energetic Lab to have garnered attention on social media recently, after Duke’s reaction to going to potty in the garden tickled Facebook users.The Labrador was incredibly excited after using the backyard to go to the toilet, sprinting all round the grass and the decking. Duke’s owner was very amused by her dog in the clip, praising him as he bounded round the garden. The TeamDogs Christmas Gt Guide, sponsored by Keep Wales Tidy, is packed with more than  treats, toys, gadgets and garments to make every dog’s tail wag with holly jolly joy on December . Weaposve tried and tested many of the gts on our own TeamDogs friends so you can ensure they’re worth placing under the tree for your most special member of the family. To download our Christmas Gt Guide for free simply subscribe to the TeamDogs newsletter.Another Labrador cross to have enjoyed TikTok success of late was Jake, whose habit of taking a torch with him to use the toilet in the dark amused viewers.Jake takes the torch from his owner before being let out into the garden to use the toilet. The clever dog uses the trick to combat his fear of the dark, obediently bringing the torch back to his owner when he is finished.

One woman claims she was recently taking the bus home when she found herself in an awkward situation with an older woman who wanted to sit by herself as she didnapost feel safe. In a post on Reddit, the younger woman, who had just finished an eight hour day at work is currently  weeks pregnant, says she sat downstairs on the bus, as she had lots of heavy shopping bags and was nervous about falling on the stairs. She purposefully says she avoided sitting in the priority seats but instead was sat behind them when she was asked to move by a more senior lady with a walking stick. And the situation resulted in some drama on the bus. Her post on the Am I The A**hole forum read: AITA for not giving up my seat on the bus   Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. So Igot on the bus after an eight hour day in work. Now I get on at very first stop on the bus route and get off at the very last stop the whole journey takes about two hours.When I got on the bus it was quite busy on the bottom deck, with only one double seat left available. Usually, I would go upstairs when itaposs this busy but this time I had about - slightly heavy bags with me and didnapost feel safe trying to get up the stairs with them especially since Iaposm  weeks pregnant, so I sat on the seat downstairs. About halfway through the journey, an older lady with a stick got on the bus and she asked me to move. She wasnapost even polite when she asked and honestly I thought she meant move over so she could sit next to me. So I moved my bags and started to scoot over, when she aposNo, No I meant can you find another seat, this seat is reserved for disabled people. You are clearly not disabled. There are plenty of seats upstairsapos. These seats were not priority seats for disabled people the ones in front of me werebut these ones were not. so I replied, aposSorry, I really donapost feel safe going up the stairs with all these bags, I donapost mind you sitting next to me though, we both have our masks onapos.  She claims the other woman told her she didnapost want to sit next to anyone  as she didnapost feel safe. She then instructed the younger woman to move your lazy fat behind and give the seat to someone who needs it. The -year-old added: I hate confrontation and I absolutely hate people who use their pregnancy as an excuse, which means I hate what I said next. Lady I am pregnant, I am not going up those stairs with these bags and risking a fall. If you really want a seat to yourself ask someone  to move. A man sitting across from them then offered up his seat and went upstairs, but not before giving the pregnant woman a dirty look. She added: The lady spent the next - minutes talking with the other oldies on the bus about how the kids these days have no respect for their elders or people with disabilities, or how they would have never have spoken to someone like in their day. This happened a couple of days ago, while my boyfriend and my dad said I was in the right, but I canapost help but feel like I acted like an entitled brat. More than  people have since responded to the womanaposs post, with many agreeing that she was not in the wrong for standing her ground. One person said: NTA. You shouldaposve pointed out where the disabled seats were. Also, f**k older people who think their age entitles them to respect...theyaposre usually the ones lacking manners. Another wrote: All seats on the bus were double seats so she would have had to have sit next to someone, which she said she didnapost want to do. So basically she wanted a double seat to herself.

Kalee McGee explained that when she adopted four-year-old Chihuahua Max from the shelter, he had no paperwork about his background. But because he was well behaved when she took him for walks, and he sits down when she gives him a treat, she assumed heaposd had some training. However, Kalee couldn’t work out why Max wasnapost listening to her. Until one day when she finally figured it out - he only understood Spanish.She shared the hilarious discovery on her TikTok account@kaleemcgee , where she said: “I’m gonna talk fast because your time is precious but this is hilarious and I have no one  to tell so please listen. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.“We adopted a dog two, three weeks ago, a great little chihuahua four years old from the shelter, no information on him, absolutely adorable, super great. “He sits when you have a treat in your hand not when you say sit, he knows what a crate is and he walks really well on a leash so it seems he has some training, but he won’t listen to us so. “We’re trying to get him to sit, trying to get him to do this stuff for weeks and we can’t figure out why he won’t listen to us…” Then they worked it out. He only speaks Spanish, she said. Our little chihuahua doesn’t know English and has been looking at us like what are you talking about. I died when I found out so I’ve got to show you. In the next clip, when she says Max come, he just stands there. But when she repeats the phrase in Spanish, he walks straight over to her wagging his tail. The same thing happens when she tells Max to sit. In English he ignores her, and in Spanish, he does exactly what she says.“I don’t speak Spanish so I know that wasn’t the best, we’ve been relying on Google Translate, but pleaseyou have anything  let me know cause I would love to see how smart this cute little man is. I just don’t speak his language.”Since being posted, the video has racked up more than . million likes and , comments from people who were impressed by Kalee’s dedication.

A photographer explored Sursock Palace, one of the last remaining residences of the Lebanese Ottoman-era which is directly in line with the disaster site. Former owner, Lady Cochrane Sursock, was inside the luxury residence during the Port of Beruit explosion but died in hospital sometime later. Despite being built in the s, the luxury residence is still a part of its namesake’s family who are committed to restoring it. A reconstruction plan for the property is expected to take six years and cost an estimated €million Roman Robroek, , a full-time photographer from the Netherlands, was able to get inside the palace to capture not only the damage, but some of the impressive surviving features as well. He said: “Photographing Sursock Palace was part of a project I was shooting for The Heritage Management Organization last summer, where I was covering the impact of the blast that happened in the Port of Beirut in August  on the architecture and cultural heritage in the city. “For this project, we partnered with a local NGO called Silat for culture.  The lovely people of Silat for culture took care of my daily schedule, driving and arranging all the required permissions to enter the locations in the city. A lot of work was involved. “The owner of the palace, Roderick Cochrane, was kind enough to open the doors of his palace for me to photograph the damage caused by the blast.” In addition to art pieces, paintings, books and china, rooms directly facing the harbour where the explosion happened were most damaged. Roman said: “Trust me, the harbour is really close to the palace. All of the glass was shattered and much of the indoor stucco was damaged “The amount of damage I encountered was a big surprise to me. It was tough to see the impact of the blast on the architecture and state of the building. There was so much debris and valuable items were damaged.”  The extent of the destruction can be seen in the once intricately decorated ceiling, which has now been replaced with a temporary metal roof to weatherproof the site and prevent further damage. In hopes of structurally preserving the building, the exterior is clad in scaffolding and netting. Inside, ornate walls and exposed beams are being supported with multiple metal structures. The former grandeur of the palace is still detectable in certain rooms. The elaborate golden front door, stone pillars and arched windows are just a few of the impressive features.  Roman added: “The main and double staircase of the building is one of the features that stood out to me. The craftsmanship in the ironwork and the chandelier are stunning.” The building and its contents were never insured resulting in ious international organisations, university students and other parties stepping in to offer extra support to save its historic grandeur.  The palaceaposs origin goes back to Constantinople and the Sursocks have been recorded as living in Beirut since . The owneraposs wealth is said to have came from in the early th century primarly in agriculture and later in manufacturingAccording to its website, the Sursock empire extended from Mersine, Turkey to Alexandria, Egypt passing by Lebanon, Cyprus and Palestine.

TV presenter Dmitry Kiselyov issued the chilling warning as Russia held live fire military drills involving more than  tanks. Despite this, Russia insists it has no plans to invade its neighbouring ex-Soviet state. State TV channel Rossiya  said a video summit set to take place between Washington and Moscow on Tuesday evening comes at a “peak of tension”.Mr Kiselyov claimed Putin - accused by the West of positioning , troops to invade Ukraine early next year - is using every opportunity to clary Russia’s stance on the search for a balance of interests”, and to make clear its “red lines”.He accused the US of peddling “fakes about Russia’s intention to invade Ukraine”, while fluffing out its feathers and demonstrating its military might” especially in the Black Sea. Warning that Biden should heed Russia’s demands over Ukraine, he alluded to Moscow’s vast nuclear arsenal and hypersonic capability. At the last Russian-American summit, Joe Biden signed a joint document with Vladimir Putin, a statement on strategic stability,” he told his viewers.“There it was written as plain as day: ‘Today, we reaffirm the principle that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought’. “If Biden accepts this, then he really doesnapost want the US to be turned into radioactive ash. “This is the red line for Biden, put by Putin.” Kiselyov has been called Putin’s “mouthpiece” and “propagandist-in-chief”.  Moscow has demanded that Ukraine should not be admitted to NATO, and that strike weapons should not be placed on its soil by Western powers, asserting that they would pose a direct threat to Russia. Meanwhile, more than  tanks crews from Russia’s Southern military district conducted live firing exercises. The district includes the Krasnodar region and annexed Black Sea peninsular Crimea which both border Ukraine. The drills involved T-B and T-A tanks, and included firing from a large-caliber anti-aircraft machine gun, said reports. “The crews improved their skills in hitting targets imitating a moving tank, anti-tank grenade launcher crew and recoilless artillery gun at distances from  to  metres,” said one account. Soldiers from the th Motorised Rle Division were also exercising at the Kadamovsky training ground in Rostov region, which also borders Ukraine, at Russia’s “newest tank training facility”, said reports. The US secretary of state Antony Blinken has told Swedish Television that the threat from Russia was “very serious because what we’ve seen is the massing of signicant forces near the border with Ukraine”. Efforts to undermine Ukraine included a “social media propaganda campaign” that has been ratcheted up ten times over the past month.  He said: The consequences would be terrible. “It’s in no one’s interest…. “We thought it was important to make very clear to Russia the consequences that would resultit engages in aggression toward Ukraine. “So I hope that that factors into President Putin’s calculus and that Russia takes another course.” A major Russian newspaper also warned Putin of the consequences of invading Ukraine.

Mike played the role of the perfect gentleman and she was swept off her feet. At , she fell in love and hoped for her fairytale ending. Four years later, she married Mike and believed she had found it. Her family and friends adored him too and Aisling was excited about their future together. However, this was not to be. Mikeaposs behaviour changed overnight, his true colours came out, and Aisling found herself trapped in an abusive relationship with no idea how to set herself free. All of a sudden, Aisling’s world came crashing down.Aisling told Womenaposs Aid: “When I was pregnant, he became more aggressive and violent.One morning, I was in the bathroom being sick and he came in and started yelling, he told me this pregnancy had made me ignore him and that he was sick of me being sick all the time. He picked up the towel and started hitting me with it. I pleaded with him to stop.” This was just the beginning for Aisling, as Mikeaposs behaviour soon escalated. He would physically hit and kick her, and when she was five months pregnant, he went too far.He started kicking me in the back, I was so frightened I was trying to hide my stomach, I was so worried about the baby, said Aisling. I had bruises all over my back and was so sore from where he had kicked me. Later that day, I started to bleed. He took me to the hospital and, crying, he told staff that I’d been in a car crash.  Later, when he was gone home for the night, I talked to a midwe again. I don’t know how, but suddenly I found myself blurting out, aposI wasn’t in a car crashapos. She was amazing. She just listened and held my hand while I spoke.The midwe put Aisling in contact with Womenaposs Aid, who were able to help her get legal protection and get away from Mike. Thanks to Women’s Aid support services, Aisling was able to find the courage and support she needed to leave years of cruelty and abuse behind her. It’s not quite over yet, but she is on the path to being free and safe.She still needs to face Mike in court to sort out child custody and access rights, but she is no longer doing it alone.If you need help getting out of an abusive situation, you can call them on    or check out their website here.*Name and some details have been changed to protect identity.

The house in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, was a typical s property, painted in bright colours and had dated furnishings. So the thrty couple used clever DIY tricks and upcycling furniture to suit their tastes without splashing out on new items. Molly, a marketing manager, gave their downstairs shower utility room a makeover on a budget using some leftover Frenchic black paint and marble vinyl cover which cost £. She painted the chrome shower doors, then painted the utility cupboards and covered the work surface in the marble sticky roll. She also upcycled an old storage box using leftover paint from another project, giving the box a stunning makeover without spending a penny. Molly also turned a £ plain glass vase from IKEA into an on-trend neutral toned decorative pot using a sample pot of concrete-effect spray from BQ which cost £.. She estimates a similar stone vase would have cost £. She even tried her hand at arts and crafts, creating her own abstract art piece for the lounge, spending £ on paints and a canvas – as opposed to an estimated £ that a similar art piece could have set them back.The couple also did the ling in their bedroom and the dining room themselves, following Instagram video tutorials and spending £ on materials.The couple finished the interior renovations in just under four months, moving in on December , . “We’re really pleased with the results – we’ve created our dream home, which we can see us living in forever, Molly said today. We are completely finished now and it has completely transformed our home. The detached property is now worth £, - a staggering % increase on the price they bought it for in August last year. It has three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen, dining room, lounge, and conservatory. Molly added: We wanted to put our own stamp on it and create something we could call our own, so we decided to go for it and do a complete renovation. It soon turned into a building site.  Professionals carried out the larger jobs – including removing the wall, working on the conservatory and the electrics – but Molly and Sam took charge of the cosmetic work. Molly said: We had evenings and weekends where we could just crack on and get stuff finished – we would sometimes be here until  or pm at night finishing off bits. Me and Sam were useless going into this – Iaposd never even painted a room before and Sam hadnapost used a drill. You just kind of learn as you go.

which swung in either direction in horrendous conditions.The sides exchanged goals in the first half, with Stuart MacLean reacting quickest in the box after the Baljaffray keeper couldn’t hold a Fraser Talbot shot and the striker scored to net his eleventh goal in eight games.Baljaffray forced a succession of corners near the end of the half and were on level terms when Red Star were only able to partially clear a corner which fell to the away side’s full back and his shot via the aid of a deflection went past young Leon Murphy in the Star goal. -Into the second half and Star could have retaken the lead when Aaron Moore latched onto a drilled cross from strike partner Stuart MacLean, however, his effort was blocked by an excellent save from the Baljaffray number one.The visitors took the lead after  minutes when a cross caused confusion in the Star defence and the Baljaffray forward had the simple task of finishing into an empty net from close range.Star huffed and puffed for an equaliser, however, they were frustrated by excellent goalkeeping until the goal came in fortuitous circumstances after a long ball was nodded past his own keeper by the Baljaffray centre back meaning the sides were level with  minutes to go.Star took the lead with five minutes remaining when Aaron Moore was able to burst clear of the Baljaffray backline and finish well into the far corner to make it -.This should have been enough to see Star over the line but Baljaffray scrambled a late equaliser when Star again failed to clear a free kick and the ball was bundled over the line to see the match end -.Lochgilphead Red Star are on their travels on Saturday November  when they face their toughest test of the season so far as they take on league leaders and title favourites

It is not #green# to have to do a -mile car journey for essentials.#The Co-op also seems to be replacing many branded items with their own products which are nowhere near as good.#He believes this policy is #pricing out rural living#, and continued: #It is particularly hard-hitting for those less mobile, non-car owners and the elderly.#Come on Co-op, a change needs to happen.#His post attracted a big response # with people in other parts of Argyll and Bute supporting his views.Mr Bates has since written directly to the Co-op, but emphasised: #The excellent hard-working management and staff at the Co-op in Tarbert are a big part of our community and are very helpful and kind. They have no control over pricing and stocking policy, which is decided by the board.#Stressing that the supermarket operates a UK pricing policy, a Co-op spokesperson said: #Co-op is committed to serving and supporting its rural communities, conveniently, including areas where other retailers often do not trade due to the increased operational costs.#Like all retailers, Co-op has experienced some patchy disruption to the availability of some products, and it is working with suppliers to re-stock as quickly as possible.#Alongside well-known brands, Co-op#s award-winning own-brand products provide shoppers with choice # delivering quality and value, while also enabling customers and community causes to unlock additional value and benefits through its membership programme.#Mr Bates added: #The Co-op bosses in Manchester need to realise that the Tarbert Co-op and others in rural locations are not convenience stores. These are often the only store for miles and are therefore leline stores.#If they do not understand this, then they do not understand the communities they are serving.#Speaking on Wednesday this week, Mr Bates said he had received no reply from Co-op management.He said ##apart from an automated receipt reply, I have heard nothing further.

mask-wearing on public transport.Some  cases of Omicron ndash also known as B... ndash were confirmed in the UK as of Sunday.But what do we know about the new strain so far, and what could it mean for future restrictions ndash How would you knowyou have contracted the Omicron strain People with Covid- symptoms should take a PCR test, and scientists can determine which strain they have contractedit is positive.This requires genetic analysis in a laboratory and can take up to  days.vw,vw,px, px\"Positive PCR tests can be analysed by scientists in a laboratory to determine which iant a person has contracted Not all UK labs are equipped with the technology needed to identy Omicron cases, which means some parts of the country will be able to track the sp easily than others.Rapid or lateral flow tests cannot tell you which iant you have been infected with, but scientists believe they will still reflect a positive resultyou have the Omicron iant.ndash When did Omicron first appear UK scientists became aware of the new strain on November , after samples were uploaded to a coronavirus iant tracking website from South Africa, Hong Kong and then Botswana.The World Health Organisationdesignated it a ldquoiant of concern on November , because it has several mutations which mean it is more dficult to predict how it will behave.ndash How is Omicron dferent to other iants The latest iant involves mutations on the spike protein of the virus, which is the part targeted by most vaccines.vw,vw,px, px\"According to the Office for National Statistics , scientists dferentiate Omicron from other iants by identying patterns among three genes in positive results ndash the S gene, the ORFab gene and the N gene.Delta iant infections usually test positive for all three genes, whereas the Omicron iant is known to test negative for the S gene..removendash Is Omicron more deadly or transmissible than previous iants It is unclear whether Omicron is more transmissible compared with other iants, including the dominant Delta strain, according to the WHO.The number of people testing positive for coronavirus has risen in areas of South Africa affected by the iant, and studies have begun to determine whether this is because it is more easily passed on.It is also unclear whether Omicron is likely to cause more deaths or severe disease, and understanding this is likely to take several more weeks, the WHO has said.ndash What are the symptoms of Omicron The WHO has said there is no evidence that symptoms associated with Omicron are dferent to those of other iants.vw,vw,px, px\"There have been  Omicron cases identied in the UK so far Initial reported infections in South Africa were among university students who had a mild disease ndash but this is common among the younger age group for all iants.The most common Covid- symptoms are still a cough, fever and a loss of smell or taste.ndash How many cases have been confirmed in the UK The UK Health Security Agency said a further  cases of Omicron had been confirmed in the UK on Sunday,  in England and  in Scotland, bringing the total to .Professor Mark Woolhouse, who is a member of the Scientic Pandemic Influenza Group on Modellingwhich advises the Government, has said Omicron is ldquospreading pretty rapidly and the figure will rise.ndash What are the concerns about Omicron and when will we knowthey are well-founded There are concerns around transmissibility, severity of illness and vaccine efficacy.Deputy chief medical officer for England Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said scientists around the world agree that the Omicron iant is ldquoof increased concern.vw,vw,px, px\"Professor Jonathan Van Tam has warnedthat Omicron could be more transmissible than previous iants He said there are still uncertainties about how transmissible the iant is and its impact on severity of disease.He said the ldquonumber of mutations present, already on first principle, makes us worry about a possible effect on vaccine effectiveness.He made clear that there ldquoare far more things we donrsquot know yet, than things we do know about the iant, but that he expects more to become clear in two weeks.ndash What is happening in the UK as scientists work to find out more about Omicron The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationis now advising that all adults aged  to  should be offered a Covid- booster dose, in order of descending age groups, to increase their level of protection.Early evidence suggests that higher antibody levels may give better protection against the iant.Booster doses should be given no sooner than three months after people have had their second dose of an original vaccine ndash shaving three months off the current six-month wait.Meanwhile, young people aged  to  should be offered a second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid- vaccine, no sooner than  weeks after their first dose.ndash Have any new measures been introduced in the UK The Government has tightened rules around PCR tests for travellers ing to the UK and introduced quarantine rules for people from high-risk countries, as well as bringing back face coverings in shops and on public transport in England.It has also accelerated the Covid booster programme to help slow down the spread of the new iant.vw,vw,px, px\"Face coverings are once again compulsory inside shops in England Scotlandrsquos First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and Walesrsquos First Minister, Mark Drakeford, have demanded that a tougher four-nations approach is adopted.Downing Street rejected calls from Ms

ldquodetrimental effect on the travel industry, No  said.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all implemented travel rules for non-red list arrivals.ndash What do tightened rules mean for Christmas parties Although there are no official bans on large gatherings, scientists have urged people to act cautiously.Professor Robert West, a member of the Scientic Pandemic Insights Group on

Early religious writings tell the story that Thenew was a victim of her fatherrsquos cruel vengeance for what he believed to be her disobedience and wrongful behaviour.One early medieval account by Jocelinus, a monk from Furness, tells us: ldquoBy the kingrsquos command, she was led to the top of a very high hill called Dunpelder, that, cast down from thence, she might be broken limb by limb, or dashed to pieces.But that didnrsquot work, so she was instead taken to the shore of Aberlady and put into the small hide vessel, pulled from the shore and set adrt.Magsrsquo art captures the terror and desperation of Thenewrsquos situation, as her tiny boat is taken by the tide out to the open sea. It is rocked by waves and she clings on for le, the freezing water lapping over her.But thankfully, there is a happy ending to this story. Her small boat begins to drt inland, across the Firth of Forth, away from the kingdom of her abuser and towards the opposite shore, where she lands just in time. There, on the beach by Culross in Fe, she finds a fire with embers still giving warmth.Jocelinus tells us: ldquoThere were, in the neighbourhood, shepherds keeping watch over the flocks. And they beheld a fire lighted close at hand, and coming with haste found the young woman with her childbirth completed, and the child wrapped in rags, lying in the open air. They, moved by pity, took care of them by increasing the fire and supplying food, and procuring other necessarieshellipSt Serf took them in and cared for them, and Thenewrsquos child would become Saint Kentigern.This story is not provable history, of course, more likely itrsquos mostly legend making. Yet unknown truths often lie under the surface of legends and I for one have always seen the universal truths in this story.When I look into the faces of my children, I hope and pray they will never feel the fear and desperation that is on the face of Thenew of being cast at sea with the desperate hope of finding a safe place.And , God forbid, they ever do, I hope they will be met by people like those shepherds.Andever they, or I, were to meet someone in such a desperate situation, then I hope we would be like those shepherds and respond with kindness, understanding and compassion.That, for

I cant see the situation dramatically changing in the next couple of weeks - we have to watch this space...thats genuinely where we are scientically right now.\": Latest Omicron casein Scotland not connected to othersA total of  cases of the Omicron iant have been confirmed in Scotland so far,including at leastnine which are linked and have been traced back to a single private event held on November .It is unclear whether the three confirmedtoday- two in NHS Lanarkshire and one in the Greater Glasgow area- are linked to this event or separate.One caseidentied in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde region, confirmed on Wednesday, was not linked to that event.The Omicron iant was first detected in Botswana in November and appears to be driving a rapid surge in Covid infections in South Africa, with signs that it is overtaking Delta as the dominant strain.There are concerns that its high number of mutations - including  on the spike protein used by the virus to infect cells - could make it more resistant to current vaccines and immunity.There are signs from Public Health Scotland data that the recent fall in Covid cases stopped on November  with a very small increase in positive cases by November If protection against infection is reduced, however, scientists remain confident that vaccines would still provide a strong defence against serious illness or death - as has already been seen following the emergence of the Delta strain.Prof Bauld said: \"I think we should be worried about Omicron because it really, genuinely does look more transmissible.\"We dont know about disease severity or immune escape from the vaccines, but we have confidence that eventhe vaccines are weakened in terms of transmission and infection that they will still work in terms of saving peoples lives basically. Even these current vaccines that we have.\"So I am worried, but Im not saying that these vaccines are useless - theyre still working and will still work, evennot as well, against Omicron.\": Abnormal spike in neonatal deaths not linked to Covid in mothers orbabiesProf Bauld told podcast listeners that it was \"absolutely imminent\" that boosters will be added to Scotlands vaccine passport apps, allowing people travelling abroad to show that they have had a third jag.Some countries are now requesting proof of boosters for entry as part of border controls, or for access into leisure and hospitality venues.However, Prof Bauld said she was not in favour of tougher rules on arrivals into the UK.The Scottish Government has asked Westminster to consider extending home self-isolation to eight days for travellers arriving from non-red list countries, with people only able to end self-isolationthey test negative for Covid on a PCR test taken on day eight.Currently, all arrivals have to take a PCR test within two days of entering the UK and remain in isolation until they receive a negative result.Prof Bauld said this was \"proportionate\".She added: \"Im really hopeful that we dont go in that direction [eight-day self-isolation] unless we absolutely have to.\"The main reason for that is that when you see domestic spread of this iant, then thinking about travel as the main source becomes less of an issue.\"Its too early to tellthat would occur - governments arent ruling it out - but its not the plan at the moment.\""},{"url":null,"title":"letters-covid-far-cant-give-now","story":"In her earlier piece, Ms Blythman claimed that, in the UK, the Covid vaccine had caused , deaths that was tripe. Now she claims that ldquothe Covid infection fatality rate is more or less the same as flu: .%. In fact the data show that there have been  million positive Covid tests, , deaths within  days of a positive test, and , deaths with Covid- on the death certicate. That gives rates of .% and .%, either  or  times the figure Ms Blythman has plucked from the air, or from a wild and wacky website.Particularly obnoxious are Ms Blythmanrsquos personal attacks on Professor Susan Michie, head of the Health Psychology Research Group at University College London, and Dr Jenny Harries, head of the UK Health Security Agency. Ms Blythman refers to ldquogrim-faced Harries and Michiehellip in their s, no young familyhellip. She says of Dr Harries: ldquoHer appearance would cause the mince pies to chill on the plate.How rude, how silly, how pathetic. When Ms Blythman descends to personal abuse, shersquos simply a troll, someone who spews bile and conspiracy theories in the hope of stirring up a storm. I expect better in The Herald.Covid isnrsquot finished with us and, after all wersquove been through, we mustnrsquot give up now. No doubt there were some in the UK who thought it would be a good idea to throw in the towel in , after two years of war and restrictions. Thank goodness wiser heads prevailed then, and I hope wiser heads than Ms Blythmanrsquos will prevail now, for all our sakes.Doug Maughan, Dunblane.* JOANNA Blythman states: \"No one in South Africa is known to have been hospitalised with the Omicron iant\" yet in the same edition Helen McArdle writes: In South Africa hospitalisations with Omicron are rising\" world of uncertainty, caution makes good sense\", The Herald, December . These two statements appear to be incompatible. Which one is correct  Personally I will be following Ms McArdles advice and being cautious. If I attend a party and Ms Blythman is present, probably not wearing a mask, I think I will take the cautious approach and find another party.Angus McKee, Glasgow.THE ART OF THE POSSIBLEBRIAN Chrystalasks us whether David Watson ldquohas a point in his criticism of the Scottish Government not acting in the face of Omicron. Yet, as Professor Linday Bauld has pointed out, ldquowe do not yet know the full extent of the challenge that will emerge in practice from Omicron.The guiding principle of Government policy regarding Covid has been that the restrictions should be proportionate to the degree of threat, sowe donrsquot know the full degree of threat how can we take proportionate action However, a wider dficulty is that each of us would place dferent weights on the conflicting aims of controlling the virus and the needs of parts of the economy, so it is almost inevitable that there will be those who will consider Government policy too draconian or too lax. Indeed, policy in Scotland has, over the course of the pandemic been characterised as the former, compared to England, and as the Financial Times noted in February, the First Ministerrsquos ldquogreater willingness to maintain restrictions has helped Scotland keep deaths and infections lower than in England.Of course, it can be argued that we should take a high level of precaution in the face of a threat which may be serious, that we donrsquot wait till we find it is serious. There is, though, another issue ndash how far will the public go in respecting new, additional restrictions  The current environment is radically dissimilar to that after the announcement of the first lockdown, when it would not be going too far to say people were frightened into following restrictions.Therefore,constraints on our behaviour are not going to be followed, and cannot be enforced, what point do they have  Is it not better to put in place the maximum limitations that most of the community can be encouraged to follow Rather than issues of right or wrong, or having a point or not, the more important and comprehensive judgement is that this is an instance that, as Harold Wilson observed, ldquoPolitics is the art of the possible.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.WILL LESSONS REALLY BE LEARNED I WAS beyond disgusted reading in Saturdays Herald about the horric way Arthur Labinjo-Hughes was treated and then murdered by his stepmother . I am not in favour of capital punishment but would definitely make an exception in the case of Ms Tustin. The father deserves no better and what failures as human beings both of them are.Despite warnings by family members, the system let down a decent wee boy and how social services could have missed this is beyond belief. Somebody deserves their jotters for this. No doubt \"lessons will be learned\" and it wont happen again, until the next time.Iain Harrison, Linlithgow.SICKENING LEVEL OF INHUMANITYMANY of us who have lived through the biblical lespan and beyond, including myself, will have reckoned that we had come to know in the world seriously awful levels of human depravity. We had come to believe that we had seen or been made aware of the worst that people were capable of. How wrong we were. I refer to the awful circumstances of the murder of young Arthur Labinjo-Hughes.Many will have been profoundly moved by the cruelty shown to that young, innocent child. I was greatly moved about the circumstances of the le Arthur was living ndash wondering when he would next be struck or bullied wondering when he would next be fed and failing to understand why he was being treated in such a despicable way. The fact that a young child could be treated with such viciousness is beyond human comprehension.It made one emotional to think of the many families who would have been pleased to take care of this little boy. I have no doubt many tears have been shed by those reading of and listening to descriptions of how Arthur was treated during his short le. His treatment and eventual loss of le represents for me a sickening and depressing level of manrsquos inhumanity to man.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.HOW COULD ANY GOD ALLOW THIS THESE past few days have seen coverage of the heart breaking story of six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, tortured and killed by his father and stepmother.The tormentors of this lovely-looking wee boy have been given long prison sentences, though whether they are enough is doubtful given the evil that obviously resides in those two iniduals who, according to court comments, showed no remorse.Most of us reading the reports of how this wee boy was treated and his calls for help: \"no one loves me\", \"who will feed me \", would feel their heart break and yet, and yet.Many of these same people, whilst in despair at just how low some of our fellow human beings can reach, are members of a church of religion and are sure of their faith. Regardless of the conduit that they believe allows them to worship, praise and exalt God ndash Christianity, Islam, Judaism and many more ndash they all have in common that God is an all-seeing, benevolent being without sin who looks after us all regardless of our role in society, especially the weak and little children. Some even believe He can forgive sincertain words are offered.Well, where was this God when the poor wee soul Arthur needed him  What had he done at the age of six to have been abandoned by God and given to the depraved iniduals who took the le of this innocent People of faith will argue we were given free will ,but Arthurs death does not square with their belief that God loves us all, and of course when challenged by those of us not taken in by fairy stories when we say how can you square the circle reply: \"Ah, but we have faith.\"Its pathetic and intellectually indefensible.

With around  voices, rushing back to singing together unmasked would, of course, have been inconceivable. The road back to singing together in person had to paved with careful blocks, each building a little more confidence for members.There will be no audience at Bearsden Choirrsquos first live performance together. The Countdown to Christmas is five short pieces of seasonal music, which will be filmed. One will be broadcast on each of the five days running up to Christmas Day. There has been careful preparation for the moment when  voices come together with musicians at Kingsborough Sanctuary to record the performances. You can view a preview of the rehearsal here.Keeping the choir connected during the height of the pandemic was the greatest priority. Using Zoom, it was clear that members were equally keen to maintain that connection, with around  logging in to weekly singing rehearsals. These became ldquoInspire sessions, with not only guest appearances from the likes of composer John Rutter but well-being sessions covering everything from vocal technique to yoga.The choirrsquos planned performance of Mendelssohnrsquos Elijah was thwarted by lockdown, but the next step was to encourage members to upload videos of themselves singing their parts of two movements at home, which was brought together and broadcast ndash no mean feat when there were more than  members taking part.The choirrsquos next step was in May ndash a critically acclaimed online performance of Vivaldirsquos Gloria. ldquoThis was the next step, says Director of Music Andrew Nunn. ldquoIt was a hybrid performance, blending virtual recordings with live recordings that I made of soloists and musicians.As much as the choir would have loved being back with their audience this Christmas, it was clear that this next step needed to be taken slowly and safely.ldquoWe knew that we wouldnrsquot be back in our usual home, the City Halls in Glasgow, this year, says Bearsden Choir chairman John Wotton. ldquoWe need to look at the safety of our members, their families and our audience and we made a decision for the long-term health and success of the choir.We will look at Bearsden Choirrsquos Countdown to Christmas programme in detail next week. The preparation to its recording has taken several months, beginning with the first in-person rehearsals at Maryhill Burgh Hall in September.

She is the first vessel of her type to go through that process and with that comes inevitable hurdles that need to be overcome. The Nordic Sea had a series of modications made to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication standard.“She was built to a dferent specication so had to go through the required checks and balances to ensure we met the current specications for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s current passenger vessel system.”He is confident that she will be a favourable addition to the fleet.“She is a really good sea keeping vessel with good properties designed with the right centre of height for that comfortable ride.”Councillor David Dawson, chair of the board of Orkney Ferries, said: “I would like to recognise the efforts of the team here in Orkney for getting us to this stage, particularly given the challenges added in by the pandemic, but also for the patience of the people of Papay.

As the trust’s chairman Dan Wise explained, it is essentially an underwater drone.He said: “This small unit will allow us to continue our collaborative research into the Orkney skate population. More specically, we will be able to get eyes underwater to look for essential fish habitat such as egg case laying grounds, nursery areas etc.“We can cover more ground with this drone when compared to ing, and the quality of the camera is greater when compared to a drop down camera – both survey styles we still do but this is another tool in the tool box.”RSPB Scotland is also going to invest in new machinery, with its £, award going to the purchase of a specialist tractor for removing vegetation.A tractor equipped with Soucy tracks will be used to cut and collect material for removal from the sites, without leaving rutted tracks or creating erosion points. This machine has signicantly less ground pressure than a normal tractor, reducing the chances of damaging sensitive habitats, and is specically designed to operate in softer ground conditions.The benefits to birdle include opening up foraging habitat, allowing flightless chicks to move around more easily, and reducing the chance of chicks becoming saturated in dense, wet vegetation.RSPB Scotland site manager in Orkney, Alan Leitch, said:“The funding means we can purchase machinery that offers us a real opportunity to upscale our annual land management efforts on the Orkney nature reserves to increase conservation benefits. These operations will help a suite of species including curlews, lapwings, and hen harriers.”The £m fund was launched in July this year and has now been extended to a total of at least £m over the next five years. On the fund in general, the Bioersity Minister, Lorna Slater, said:“Too much of Scotland’s natural environment is degraded after years of over-exploitation, but this government is committed to restoring nature and our wildle. The Nature Restoration Fund will play a big role in delivering these aspirations, and the projects we are funding today are just the beginning.#The fund kick starts a new approach, supporting longer-term, larger, landscape-scale projects across Scotland # on land and at sea # that address the twin crises of bioersity loss and climate change. Over this parliament we will invest at least £ million through the fund, delivering real change that people and nature will benefit from across the whole country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Although folk must still enter via the south nave side door, once inside the cathedral, everyone will be able to enjoy the new glazed timber vestibule.Meredith Macbeth, St Magnus Cathedral#s historical buildings conservator, said: “We are absolutely delighted with the work so far and the new vestibule truly enhances the entryway of this wonderful building. The works are not entirely complete as the curved glass has been delayed by the supplier in Europe due to COVID, Brexit and other supply issues, but we are expecting it early . So for now the area will remain roped off from the public, but it is a delight to see the new vestibule settling in and the excited response by those who know the building so well.”Councillor Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC#s education, leisure and housing committee, said: “The cathedral really is the gt that keeps on giving to the people of Orkney and further afield.#What a beautul addition to what is a very special building. I look forward to seeing the complete, finished product which is sure to be absolutely stunning.”Elaine Grieve from the Society of the Friends of St Magnus Cathedral, who are making a substantial contribution to the costs of the work, said: “The Cathedral is so precious that it is hard to contemplate making any changes for fear they won’t do the building justice.#However, in this case, what an absolutely wonderful transformation the vestibule has made to the entrance of the building. The craftmanship is outstanding and we now have an addition which befits this treasured building loved by so many near and far.”The cathedral#s stonework also enjoyed a facelt recently.Conservation works included repointing stonework with lime mortar on the interior and exterior of the west door. Samples of original lime mortars were found deep in the constructions joints of the building and were analysed by the Scottish Lime Centre in Fe. An appropriate mix was specied, to match in manner of strength, colour and aggregate size.For anyone wishing to visit there are signs directly through the side gate, please be mindful of the restrictions in place in regards to the pandemic such as the wearing of masks and social distancing while inside.St Magnus Cathedral is managed by OIC on behalf of the people of Orkney. Casey Construction Ltd. was awarded the contract to carry out the essential maintenance work and improvements.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Personally I donrsquot hunt, I donrsquot particularly like hunting but I canrsquot support this particular bill because I think that it isnrsquot well thought through. It might be well meaning but not well thought through and has damaging consequencesit came into force.Hunting with dogs has been banned in England, Scotland, and Wales since the early s.The bill will be open for debate on the floor of the Assembly on Monday after gaining signicant support during a public consultation with nearly % of the , respondents in favour of a ban.It is understood to be the largest consultation response in Stormontrsquos history.The bill has been backed by the Northern Ireland animal welfare charity, the USPCA.Mr Blair said: ldquoNorthern Ireland is the only part of the United Kingdom without a ban on hunting with dogs, despite widespread public support to ban the practice.ldquoIt is my intention in bringing forward my Private Memberrsquos Bill, to reform legislation on hunting wild mammals with dogs in Northern Ireland, and bring our legislation in line with that in England, Scotland and Wales where the practice has been illegal for close to  years. vw,vw,px, px\"USPCA chief executive Brendan Mullan Chief executive Brendan Mullan said the charity has been ldquogreatly encouraged by the momentum around this bill.ldquoThe appetite of the public to end this cruel practice which causes unthinkable pain and suffering for innocent wild animals, he said.ldquoIt must be recognised that, now, with the bill being presented to the Assembly, we are coming to a pivotal juncture for animal welfare here in Northern Ireland, which will set the tone for our future.ldquoThere is a real opportunity here for the Assembly to put on record their commitment to enhancing animal welfare standards, and specically on this occasion, introducing legislation which has been in place in other regions for nearly  years.ldquoThe arguments against banning hunting wild mammals with dogs are based on tradition and pest control however it is categorically clear that the cruelty involved in this activity far outweighs any supposed benefit.ldquoMoreover, the rationalisation regarding pest control is tenuous at best as there is no evidence of this being the case.ldquoIn England for example, the ban has been in place for quite some time and an inquiry taken forward at Westminster has stated that the contribution of fox hunting is almost insignicant in terms of managing the fox population as a whole.Mr Mullan added: ldquoThis issue has been a key focus of the USPCA for a number of years, with our goal for the introduction of a ban outlined in our Animal Welfare Manesto lsquoAddressing the Deficitrsquo.ldquoMembers of the public have made their views on this barbaric lsquosportrsquo very clear, and we look forward to the Assemblyrsquos response which we hope will consign it to the pages of history for Northern Ireland. Killing defenceless wild mammals with dogs is sadistic and cruel and has no place in a compassionate society.But Gary McCartney, director of Countryside Alliance Ireland, which opposes the bill, contended that it could ldquopotentially criminalise every dog owner in Northern Ireland and ldquoalso represents an attack on the rural way of le.ldquoAnyone whose dog chases a rabbit or squirrel, for example, whilst they are simply out for a walk in the park, partaking in country pursuits, checking their livestock or engaged in any other activity will be committing a criminal offence, he said.ldquoWe are continuing to urge MLAs to oppose this bill.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

travel rules and sparked ato compulsory mask-wearing on public transport.Some  cases of Omicron ndash also known as B... ndash were confirmed in the UK as of Sunday.But what do we know about the new strain so far, and what could it mean for future restrictions ndash How would you knowyou have contracted the Omicron strain People with Covid- symptoms should take a PCR test, and scientists can determine which strain they have contractedit is positive.This requires genetic analysis in a laboratory and can take up to  days. vw,vw,px, px\"Positive PCR tests can be analysed by scientists in a laboratory to determine which iant a person has contracted Not all UK labs are equipped with the technology needed to identy Omicron cases, which means some parts of the country will be able to track the sp easily than others.Rapid or lateral flow tests cannot tell you which iant you have been infected with, but scientists believe they will still reflect a positive resultyou have the Omicron iant.ndash When did Omicron first appear UK scientists became aware of the new strain on November , after samples were uploaded to a coronavirus iant tracking website from South Africa, Hong Kong and then Botswana.The World Health Organisationdesignated it a ldquoiant of concern on November , because it has several mutations which mean it is more dficult to predict how it will behave.ndash How is Omicron dferent to other iants The latest iant involves mutations on the spike protein of the virus, which is the part targeted by most vaccines. vw,vw,px, px\"According to the Office for National Statistics , scientists dferentiate Omicron from other iants by identying patterns among three genes in positive results ndash the S gene, the ORFab gene and the N gene.Delta iant infections usually test positive for all three genes, whereas the Omicron iant is known to test negative for the S gene.ndash Is Omicron more deadly or transmissible than previous iants It is unclear whether Omicron is more transmissible compared with other iants, including the dominant Delta strain, according to the WHO.The number of people testing positive for coronavirus has risen in areas of South Africa affected by the iant, and studies have begun to determine whether this is because it is more easily passed on.It is also unclear whether Omicron is likely to cause more deaths or severe disease, and understanding this is likely to take several more weeks, the WHO has said.ndash What are the symptoms of Omicron The WHO has said there is no evidence that symptoms associated with Omicron are dferent to those of other iants. vw,vw,px, px\"There have been  Omicron cases identied in the UK so far Initial reported infections in South Africa were among university students who had a mild disease ndash but this is common among the younger age group for all iants.The most common Covid- symptoms are still a cough, fever and a loss of smell or taste.ndash How many cases have been confirmed in the UK The UK Health Security Agency said a further  cases of Omicron had been confirmed in the UK on Sunday,  in England and  in Scotland, bringing the total to .Professor Mark Woolhouse, who is a member of the Scientic Pandemic Influenza Group on Modellingwhich advises the Government, has said Omicron is ldquospreading pretty rapidly and the figure will rise.ndash What are the concerns about Omicron and when will we knowthey are well-founded There are concerns around transmissibility, severity of illness and vaccine efficacy.Deputy chief medical officer for England Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said scientists around the world agree that the Omicron iant is ldquoof increased concern. vw,vw,px, px\"Professor Jonathan Van Tam has warnedthat Omicron could be more transmissible than previous iants He said there are still uncertainties about how transmissible the iant is and its impact on severity of disease.He said the ldquonumber of mutations present, already on first principle, makes us worry about a possible effect on vaccine effectiveness.He made clear that there ldquoare far more things we donrsquot know yet, than things we do know about the iant, but that he expects more to become clear in two weeks.ndash What is happening in the UK as scientists work to find out more about Omicron The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationis now advising that all adults aged  to  should be offered a Covid- booster dose, in order of descending age groups, to increase their level of protection.Early evidence suggests that higher antibody levels may give better protection against the iant.Booster doses should be given no sooner than three months after people have had their second dose of an original vaccine ndash shaving three months off the current six-month wait.Meanwhile, young people aged  to  should be offered a second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid- vaccine, no sooner than  weeks after their first dose.ndash Have any new measures been introduced in the UK The Government has tightened rules around PCR tests for travellers ing to the UK and introduced quarantine rules for people from high-risk countries, as well as bringing back face coverings in shops and on public transport in England.It has also accelerated the Covid booster programme to help slow down the spread of the new iant. vw,vw,px, px\"Face coverings are once again compulsory inside shops in England Scotlandrsquos First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and Walesrsquos First Minister, Mark Drakeford, have demanded that a tougher four-nations approach is adopted.Downing Street rejected calls from Ms Sturgeon and Mr Drakeford for the self-isolation period for travellers to be extended until the result of a test on day eight after arriving in the UK.Extending the requirements would have a ldquodetrimental effect on the travel industry, No  said.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all implemented travel rules for non-red list arrivals.ndash What do tightened rules mean for Christmas parties Although there are no official bans on large gatherings, scientists have urged people to act cautiously.Professor Robert West, a member of the Scientic Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours , encouraged revellers to make ldquoflexible plans for the holiday period. vw,vw,px, px\"Despite tightened restrictions in England, there are no bans on gatherings for Christmas parties He told Sky News last week he personally would not make plans ldquothat involve gatherings that canrsquot be changed.Prof West said: ldquoIn other words, keep flexible. Make your plans, by all means, as I am, but do it in a way which means that should the worst come to the worst, and we have to make sure that people stay apart from each other as much as possible as is safe, then you can still enjoy the holiday period.ndash What about working from home England is the only UK nation where working from home is not encouraged.Ms Sturgeon reminded people in Scotland on Monday to ldquowork from homepossible.The advice is the same in Northern Ireland, and working from home is encouraged under current guidance in Wales.Previously the Prime Ministerrsquos spokesman has said it was up to employers to decide on the ldquoright balance for them, when it came to whether staff worked from home or the office.Jurisdiction over coronavirus restrictions is devolved, meaning Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos policies apply to England, and may dfer from the rules where in the UK.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Last night was the first night.”“I went down on Monday and there was no mention of it. You used to get a  per cent discount.”He added: “I was totally surprised. I only booked my ticket a week or so ago. I wasn’t advised, and it doesn’t seem astheir crew was advised – I did query it with them.”Serco NorthLink’s commercial director Jim Dow said: “We are proud to offer an extensive food and drink menu on board that is very reasonably priced and equal for all passengers.“Our commitment to working with local suppliers continues and we are proud to showcase those partnerships. “While the Islander discount code is no longer in place, all passengers do have access to a iety of choices and price points.”A classic example of where profits are more important than the service Serco gives. Despite it being a leline service, Serco obviously see#s this as an oppertunity to profit from this by penalising islanders regardless. I would suggest people take onboard a lunch box, which would probably be cheaper, on their next trip down south. ...Ryan Taylor has worked as a reporter since , and has been at The Shetland Times since , covering a wide iety of news topics.Before then he reported for other newspapers in the Highlands, where he was raised, and in Fe, where he began his career with DC Thomson.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4285900.jpg--.jpg?1638548013000\n","title":"ballymena soprano catrina launches classical celtic christmas album","story":"BALLYMENA Soprano, Catrina Scullion, is launching her new album, “Classical Celtic Christmas”, in St Marys Church, Haddington Road, Dublin, tonight at pm.For those who cannot attend, the event will be broadcast virtually from the church.To watch this event please visit https:www.stmaryshaddingtonroad.ie Popular songs will include O Holy Night and Silent Night.Catrinas CD will be available in the Repository at All Saints Church, Ballymena, for pound, with proceeds being donated to St Vincent DePaul.It is hoped the local community in Ballymena will tune in and support Catrina.The Ballymenachatted to Catrina this week.

Led by Linzi McGaughey and Clare Caulfield, the group reached far and wide across the borough to ask for materials and sewers who could turn the materials into scrubs.“Such was the scale of the operation, and the scale of the generosity of local people, that soon teams of people had to be drafted in to help source, sort and allocate materials to the sewers. Sewing machines were dusted off, and a real dference was made to our frontline healthcare system.“Local businesses and communities got behind the group with fundraising, and the demand for their scrubs just kept growing. Up to  hours a day was spent taking orders directly from the hospitals, doctors, nurses, community workers, and care homes. We are all indebted to this group of amazing people, and it was wonderful to be able to view their latest creation in quilt form as a testament to all of their hard work and dedication.”Health Minister Robin Swann added: “The pandemic will be etched in our memories as one of the most challenging, anxious and indeed sad periods in our history but for me it will also be a time when we saw humanity at its very best. Despite adversity, we witnessed teams of volunteers, like NI Scrubs, step forward and achieve so much.“You should all be very proud of the contribution you made and you have my sincere appreciation for your efforts. There is no doubt that Covid has been a hugely challenging time for everyone and this is particularly true for those working in our health and social care services. The tapestry is a very fitting tribute to all the staff who worked tirelessly and courageously for us throughout the pandemic.“I want to again place on record my thanks to every single one of our health and social care workers for everything they do, every day.”Accepting the tapestry on behalf of Northern Health and Social Care Trust, Chairman Bob McCann, said: “I would like to thank the NI Scrubs volunteers for this very poignant and reflective piece of art, which in years to come will be a very important reminder of how far we all came in the fight against COVID-.“The pandemic has clearly had a signicant and sustained impact on all aspects of our health service and our staff have faced many challenges over the course of the last  months. I know that staff were very appreciative of initiatives such as that of NI Scrubs and the generosity and kindness shown to staff buoyed them during some of the darkest days.”Clare Caulfield from NI Scrubs said the tapestry was “a wonderful legacy” to all those who played their part.She added: “At the time we asked all our volunteers to give us a piece of material with their initials on it. We asked them to send the pieces in but we didnt tell them what we were going to do with them. “We had them made into a large tapestry, a wonderful legacy to everyone involved.” Clare continued: “The huge effort of every volunteer will be talked about for generations. It is mine and Linzi’s honour to have played a small part in this incredible team of amazing iniduals who stepped up when our country needed kindness, support and community the most.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4283615.jpg--.jpg?1638527740000\n","title":"demand high for booster jabs says trust","story":"The Seven Towers Mass Vaccination Centre is open for booster jabs for those aged over  group as per Department of Health guidance.

It’s helping me build my confidence every day.“My addictions don’t even bother me anymore, for the first time in my le I’m considered at extremely low risk of reoffending.“The coaches in the club have just been amazing, I don’t know where I would be sittingit wasn’t for them“They’ve never judged, they involve me in everything and that’s just so amazing for me.“You know I’ve lived in Belfast for  years and had never been in Tigers Bay until this week and just couldn’t get over the welcome, as we were leaving all the neighbours were out wishing the children Merry Christmas, it was just such a lovely experience”.Rosie credits the  Trust, Dean Clarke Foundation, Intercomm and Bill Shaw with helping the Building Bridges CBC organise the cross-community event.“This project started about boxing but now it is about giving these kids a purpose, I spent most of my le in prison, I want make sure they don’t follow that same path”, she added.Most ReadBankrupt star Mark Allen snookered by £k tax billFAI only ever interested in nationalist players, says ex-NI boss O’NeillSmirking paedophile priest turns his grubby hands to perverted literatureOne third of DUP MLAs may stand down before next Stormont election: reportsTributes paid to schoolgirlwho died suddenlyTop VideosPlayWatch: Storm Barra predicted route across UK and Ireland from Met OfficePlayVideo: Man dies in Larne after crash involving pedestrian and carPlayVideo: CCTV Footage shows man engulfed in getaway car fireball after Dublin shootingLatest Northern IrelandStormont Assembly debate on Covid certication ‘absolutely should happen’Man accused of harassing ex-partner left condoms and women’s underwear on her doorstep, court toldStorm Barra: Yellow weather warning as NI set to be battered by strong winds and heavy rainLate Stephen Fallon strike helps Linfield power on but Coleraine manager Oran Kearney rages at double injusticeCondolences offered to family of young man killed in Larne crashLatestBristol private school will drop name of slave trader Edward ColstonStormont Assembly debate on Covid certication ‘absolutely should happen’Newcastle begin removing Sports Direct branding from St James’ ParkInflation could ‘comfortably exceed’ % by spring, warns Bank deputy governorMan accused of harassing ex-partner left condoms and women’s underwear on her doorstep, court told,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Every animal, every family has their story,” they wrote in a status, which has gone viral.The founder, Karen Matthews, said in an emotional interview: “It’s been so tough, some of our volunteers have just been sitting in tears, we currently have  dogs in our care.“We do our best and we take care of them to the highest level, but we worry about the ability to give the same level of emotional care to them.”She said she took to social media because she reached “breaking point”, and after some of Almost Home’s near  volunteers worked non-stop for eight days straight to care for the over  animals currently in their care.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreAnimal cruelty law needs to deal with puppy smuggling, committee toldAsked why they have seen the recent levels of animals being surrendered and brought to Almost Home, Karen believes lockdown has been the main factor.“Lockdown put humans’ lives on hold, but people forget it also put their pets# lives on hold too,” she added.“Dogs who were used to active lestyles and socialising were kept indoors because their owners couldn’t go out, so this caused a massive change in behaviour for some.“We had pets given to us because their owners had died of Covid as well.I had a couple ring me just the other month to tell me they had lost everything because of the pandemic and were moving to rented accommodation and couldn’t take their dogs of - years with them.I’ve had people tell me that they had to go to food banks just so that they could feed their children, never mind feeding their pets and therefore had to give them up, it’s really heartbreaking.”Founded in , Almost Home’s Facebook plea has racked up hundreds of comments from wellwishers and supporters.One comment read: “This is so honest, poor wee pets, I don’t think people fully understand what it takes to look after a dog, let alone a puppy.”Another called Almost Home’s team “superheroes” and many also shared photos of their pets they had obtained via Almost Home to highlight their amazing work.The group is also non-profit, meaning they have no paid staff and rely completely on donations and public support.Karen added: “We have lots of volunteers off sick at the moment, we’re doing our best but we’re stretched. What was once a three-hour sht for one volunteer has turned into six or seven hours.“People also just think it’s sitting around all day cuddling animals — it’s not, it’s hard work.I had a volunteer turn to me recently when leaving, and just said two words into my eyes: ‘I’m broken’.”The charity believes the rise of puppy farms, often warehouses where ‘designer dogs’ breeds like British and French bulldogs are bred repeatedly to a dangerous level to then sell their puppies for thousands of pounds, are also to blame.Karen added: “We had two dogs come in from a puppy farm just the other week, one had spinal damage so badly because they lived in a crate all day, one had urine burns on their legs so bad they couldn’t even stand.Karen says both dogs are now recovering and doing well in Almost Home’s care.They also said they have had owners turn up randomly and approach their volunteers on the grounds with dogs, which had been fully vetted for home releases, only to just hand the dogs over before literally running away.Almost Home also said they are scared the continued levels of surrendered animals will only get worse after Christmas — as dogs are given as gts and then given up due to the new owner’s underestimating the demands of a puppy.“It’s % only going to get worse in the New Year, especially because as puppy farms who had increased their prices during lockdown have now seen less demand with people going back to work,” she added.Karen has warned and pleaded to those thinking of giving an animal as a gt this Christmas.She added: “Please, please think about it, especially with the rise of farms and breeders who just see their animals as stock.”She said the often-quoted message of “a dog is for le, not just for Christmas” is more than just a bumper sticker for cars.Most ReadBankrupt star Mark Allen snookered by £k tax billFAI only ever interested in nationalist players, says ex-NI boss O’NeillSmirking paedophile priest turns his grubby hands to perverted literatureOne third of DUP MLAs may stand down before next Stormont election: reportsTributes paid to schoolgirlwho died suddenlyTop VideosPlayWatch: Storm Barra predicted route across UK and Ireland from Met OfficePlayVideo: Man dies in Larne after crash involving pedestrian and carPlayVideo: CCTV Footage shows man engulfed in getaway car fireball after Dublin shootingLatest Northern IrelandStorm Barra: Yellow weather warning as NI set to be battered by strong winds and heavy rainLate Stephen Fallon strike helps Linfield power on but Coleraine manager Oran Kearney rages at double injusticeCondolences offered to family of young man killed in Larne crashAlliance MLA Blair rubbishes claim dog walkers could be criminalised in new anti-hunting billDungannon Swts banish away days blues and now manager Dean Shiels wants his side to continue to soarLatestJoey Barton cleared of assault charge over tunnel incident after matchMuslim golf pioneer Amir Malik planning ‘bigger and better’ fundraisers in % of internet users saw content they believed was ‘untrue or doubtful’ in Johnson did not ‘misdirect’ himself over Ministerial Code when backing PatelMan who killed ex-girlfriend admits attempted murder of second person,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

You could probably multiply that apprehensiveness by a factor of  for Co Down couple David and Fiona Boyd-Armstrong when, seven years ago, they took a deep breath and sent Northern Ireland’s first artisan gin out into the shops.Shortcross hit the shelves in , blazing a trail for a new wave of small spirit distillers and adding a new dimension to what was then Northern Ireland’s fledgling food and drink renaissance. Today it’s a familiar and trusted brand with a loyal fan base. But don’t think any of that came easily.Shortly before they married in , David and Fiona went on a wine tour in France, made some valuable contacts, and mulled over the idea of their own drinks business as they planned a future together. “In an ideal world we’d have started our own vineyard,” admits David. “But hey, we live in Co Down.”So instead they turned to gin. At the time, craft gin just wasn’t on the radar at all here. No one  was making it and the vast majority of drinkers had a limited choice of Gordon’s or maybe Cork Dry or Gilbey’s. In these days of bars with eye-popping gin menus stretching to hundreds of brands, it’s hard to appreciate just how audacious the Boyd-Armstrongs’ decision was.David and Fiona spent every weekend and every holiday doing research and visiting distilleries across the globe from Seattle to Seoul. They found inspiration in the legion of micro-producers dotted across America and took heart from the buying policy of one of the bigger bars in Seattle, which stocked nothing but small-scale, locally-produced drinks.The couple ordered their first still in , installed it at Rademon — the Crossgar estate owned by Fiona’s family — and spent the summer and autumn of that year developing and fine-tuning their recipe. They wanted to do everything themselves. “There was no bottling plant available to us so we had to learn how to bottle,” says Fiona. “We had to become experts in every part of the process.”After the launch in , they found they still had another part of the process to learn. Producing a new gin was only half the battle — the other half was trying to convince gin drinkers to forego their Gordon’s or their Cork Dry and try Shortcross instead. “It was like climbing a mountain,” Fiona confesses.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “Introducing anything new is always going to be challenging — for example, it took us three years to get Shortcross into airport shops,” she says. “Really it’s all about changing perceptions. We found that people get more interested in your gin when you break it down for them and explain the components and how they come together.”It took years of hard work and resolve to make Shortcross the success it is today. With a larger still, a team of around  people and an expanding range that includes a cask-aged gin and the highly successful Rosie’s Garden pink gin, it must have been tempting for the Boyd-Armstrongs just to keep on doing what they’re doing.But all the time, in the background, there was another project that fascinated them.Just a couple of years after the first gin was launched, David and Fiona began distilling whiskey. And just like in the gin process, they wanted to do everything themselves. David had grown up in east Belfast, in the shadow of buildings that once housed the famous old whiskey distilleries of Avoniel and Connswater, and long before they starting making whiskey themselves, Fiona had become fascinated by the story of Ulster’s lost distilleries, so perhaps the seed of an idea had been quietly germinating for many years before it finally became a reality.Once they had produced a raw spirit from malted barley on a small -litre still, they decided they wanted to do something dferent with it. Whiskey often begins its slow process of maturation in American oak barrels, sometimes ones that have previously held bourbon, and is then finished in something like old sherry casks. But the Boyd-Armstrongs opted to do things the other way round. In March  they obtained two Grand Cru Classe Bordeaux wine casks, filled them with their newly-made spirit and put them away to quietly mature.“The casks you use really have to match the spirit you distil,” says David. “There’s a degree of black magic in deciding what you want to use and theof time the whiskey spends in each one.”After the Bordeaux casks had weaved their black magic spell, the whiskey was finished in barrels made from virgin American oak. The Boyd-Armstrongs could have bottled and sold the whiskey after three years but instead let it sit for two more. “We found it just kept getting better and better,” says David. “Finishing it in the American oak casks brought a sweetness and a nuttiness to it.”The finished whiskey finally made it into slightly fewer than  bottles just last month and when David and Fiona spoke to me they were still waiting for the labels to arrive.“In commercial terms it’s one of the smallest batches of whiskey you’ll find anywhere,” says David. But he also proudly points out it’s the first new whiskey to be wholly produced by a Northern Ireland distillery outside of Old Bushmills since the s.Just like their gin, Shortcross whiskey is a product made entirely on site to unique specications and then launched into a market where there are big players galore. It seems David and Fiona wouldn’t have it any other way.You can pre-order a bottle of Shortcross whiskey online at www.rademonestatedistilleryRead MoreGary Law:OpinionCrack open a bottle of Northern Ireland wine… all the way from New ZealandGary Law:OpinionHow a unique gin process was reborn thanks to a scrap of paper hidden in the back of a mirrorMost ReadBankrupt star Mark Allen snookered by £k tax billFAI only ever interested in nationalist players, says ex-NI boss O’NeillSmirking paedophile priest turns his grubby hands to perverted literatureOne third of DUP MLAs may stand down before next Stormont election: reportsTributes paid to schoolgirlwho died suddenlyTop VideosPlayWatch: Storm Barra predicted route across UK and Ireland from Met OfficePlayVideo: Man dies in Larne after crash involving pedestrian and carPlayVideo: CCTV Footage shows man engulfed in getaway car fireball after Dublin shootingLatest Northern IrelandStormont Assembly debate on Covid certication ‘absolutely should happen’Man accused of harassing ex-partner left condoms and women’s underwear on her doorstep, court toldStorm Barra: Yellow weather warning as NI set to be battered by strong winds and heavy rainLate Stephen Fallon strike helps Linfield power on but Coleraine manager Oran Kearney rages at double injusticeCondolences offered to family of young man killed in Larne crashLatestBristol private school will drop name of slave trader Edward ColstonStormont Assembly debate on Covid certication ‘absolutely should happen’Newcastle begin removing Sports Direct branding from St James’ ParkInflation could ‘comfortably exceed’ % by spring, warns Bank deputy governorMan accused of harassing ex-partner left condoms and women’s underwear on her doorstep, court told,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

These are:“Womenwho were orced at pension age but whose pension was not assessed on the basis of their ex-spouse’s contributions“Womenwho orced post pension age and notied DWP of this fact but where their pension was not reassessed on the basis of their ex-spouse’s contributions.”Problems with underpayments came to light when Sir Steve, along with This is Money, brought inidual cases to the DWP’s attention – and Sir Steve said he believed the “systemic” problems originally found may also exist for some orced women.The Department has dismissed concerns around this group far too lightlySir Steve WebbThe letter says: “If the Department accepts that a failure to act on a change in circumstances can cause widows and others to be underpaid, why not accept that orced women could be missing out for exactly the same reason ”Sir Steve said growing examples have emerged of orced women who had previously been underpaid due to errors, including:– A woman who was orced when she reached pension age was not assessed on the basis of her ex-husband’s contributions. She was underpaid for  years and was recently awarded a back-payment of over £,– Another woman who was orced when she retired and was told she had no state pension entitlement. When she recently made a claim, it was accepted she was entitled to over £ per week and shemade a back-payment of over £,– A woman notied DWP of her post-retirement orce in  but no action was taken. As recently as , she was told her pension was correct. She has now had an increase in her pension of over £ per week plus arrears of £,– And another retiree who orced post-retirement who has received arrears of £, plus a large pension increase, Sir Steve said.He said: “A series of inidual cases has highlighted blunders which have led to orced women being underpaid by tens of thousands of pounds, in some cases for a decade or more.“The Department has dismissed concerns around this group far too lightly and should take another look to assess the scale of the problem and then take action to put things right.”Sir Steve said copies of the letter had also been sent to the chairs of the Work and Pensions Committee and the Public Accounts Committee, as well as to the head of the National Audit Office.

Butwe were all truly honest, isn’t it the side dishes we’re actually looking forward to most  googletag.cmd.push Pigs in blankets, bread sauce, cranberry sauce, roasted parsnips, stuffing… these tasty jewels beside the golden bird are arguably the best bit. We asked some celeb chefs and food writers to share their favourite festive sides, with tips for how to cook them too… . Ruby Tandoh adores a Yorkshire pudding       “My favourite side dish has to be the Yorkshire pudding,” says Tandoh, author of new cookbook, Cook As You Are. “Whether or not it’s strictly canon depends on who you’re speaking to, but I can’t imagine a better vessel for mopping up gravy. It’s the perfect counterpoint to the meaty savouriness of the Christmas dinner plate.” . Gordon Ramsay has very specic thoughts on stuffing      “Stuffing’s something that people think needs to be stuffed in the cavity of the turkey – that’s the worst place to cook a stuffing. It’s not good in there. There’s a reason why you don’t put much in that cavity,” says Ramsay, whose new recipe collection, Ramsay In , is out now.“To make a really good stuffing is something I do separately. And so, I get the ground sausage, the pork, the beef. And then from there we’ll put in some smoked pancetta, some beautully roasted pistachios, some chopped up apricot and bake it in the tray prior. And then as it comes out, we’ll add some resting juices from the turkey and let it sit and absorb.” . Donal Skehan appreciates the humble Brussels sprout…     “Brussels sprouts are my favourite. I love them every way,” say Irish chef Skehan, author of Everyday Cook. “I love them as a salad as well. Very much a winter salad – in a food processor, bag of sprouts, straight down the chute into the chopper, mix it together with some really good chunks of Pecorino cheese, and some dried cranberries or even pomegranate, would be lovely. And then just a light dressing and some nuts maybe as well, something to crunch, toasted walnuts would be nice. Youmix that together and it’s like a Brussel’s sprout slaw, but it is stunning.” . Same goes for River Cottage’s Lucy Brazier       “Sprouts with chestnuts, because I think that tastes like Christmas,” says food writer Lucy Brazier, whose new cookbook, Christmas at River Cottage, is all about the festive food season. “I could eat a bowl of that without anything .” . Gino D’Acampo gets excited about the roasted veg       “I’m a huge roasted vegetable fan at Christmas,” says the chef, celebrating his new series and cookbook, Gino’s Italian Family Adventure. “We do them with balsamic vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, parsley, a few capers, all these – amazing. Funnily enough I do like stuffing, because what is stuffing, sausage with herbs and a bit of bread  Very tasty, I like that. I hate Turkey. I don’t like turkey.” . James Martin has a buttery way with carrots       Chef James Martin loves carrots cooked in butter – Butter being the title of his new cookbook. He does them “in a style of Vichy – Vichy is a town in the south of France. They cook everything in mineral water, sugar, butter and salt to produce this amazing taste, butyou use the addition of star anise it makes carrots taste amazing.” . Mary Berry champions the good old celeriac       “I love celeriac,” says Mary Berry . “I just cook it until it’s soft. It’s knobbly. If you grow it, it doesn’t come to fruition until November. You can buy it earlier. And I cook it until it’s tender then add full-fat cregraveme fresh to it and puree it. It is delicious. It reheats well.” She also makes chestnut stuffing. “I do them the day before and I do it in small shapes and fry them, then all I’ve got to do is reheat them.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warningWeatherStorm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Ben McCarron scores a secon half penalty for Steelstown.

Butwe were all truly honest, isn’t it the side dishes we’re actually looking forward to most  googletag.cmd.push Pigs in blankets, bread sauce, cranberry sauce, roasted parsnips, stuffing… these tasty jewels beside the golden bird are arguably the best bit. We asked some celeb chefs and food writers to share their favourite festive sides, with tips for how to cook them too… . Ruby Tandoh adores a Yorkshire pudding       “My favourite side dish has to be the Yorkshire pudding,” says Tandoh, author of new cookbook, Cook As You Are. “Whether or not it’s strictly canon depends on who you’re speaking to, but I can’t imagine a better vessel for mopping up gravy. It’s the perfect counterpoint to the meaty savouriness of the Christmas dinner plate.” . Gordon Ramsay has very specic thoughts on stuffing      “Stuffing’s something that people think needs to be stuffed in the cavity of the turkey – that’s the worst place to cook a stuffing. It’s not good in there. There’s a reason why you don’t put much in that cavity,” says Ramsay, whose new recipe collection, Ramsay In , is out now.“To make a really good stuffing is something I do separately. And so, I get the ground sausage, the pork, the beef. And then from there we’ll put in some smoked pancetta, some beautully roasted pistachios, some chopped up apricot and bake it in the tray prior. And then as it comes out, we’ll add some resting juices from the turkey and let it sit and absorb.” . Donal Skehan appreciates the humble Brussels sprout…     “Brussels sprouts are my favourite. I love them every way,” say Irish chef Skehan, author of Everyday Cook. “I love them as a salad as well. Very much a winter salad – in a food processor, bag of sprouts, straight down the chute into the chopper, mix it together with some really good chunks of Pecorino cheese, and some dried cranberries or even pomegranate, would be lovely. And then just a light dressing and some nuts maybe as well, something to crunch, toasted walnuts would be nice. Youmix that together and it’s like a Brussel’s sprout slaw, but it is stunning.” . Same goes for River Cottage’s Lucy Brazier       “Sprouts with chestnuts, because I think that tastes like Christmas,” says food writer Lucy Brazier, whose new cookbook, Christmas at River Cottage, is all about the festive food season. “I could eat a bowl of that without anything .” . Gino D’Acampo gets excited about the roasted veg       “I’m a huge roasted vegetable fan at Christmas,” says the chef, celebrating his new series and cookbook, Gino’s Italian Family Adventure. “We do them with balsamic vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, parsley, a few capers, all these – amazing. Funnily enough I do like stuffing, because what is stuffing, sausage with herbs and a bit of bread  Very tasty, I like that. I hate Turkey. I don’t like turkey.” . James Martin has a buttery way with carrots       Chef James Martin loves carrots cooked in butter – Butter being the title of his new cookbook. He does them “in a style of Vichy – Vichy is a town in the south of France. They cook everything in mineral water, sugar, butter and salt to produce this amazing taste, butyou use the addition of star anise it makes carrots taste amazing.” . Mary Berry champions the good old celeriac       “I love celeriac,” says Mary Berry . “I just cook it until it’s soft. It’s knobbly. If you grow it, it doesn’t come to fruition until November. You can buy it earlier. And I cook it until it’s tender then add full-fat cregraveme fresh to it and puree it. It is delicious. It reheats well.” She also makes chestnut stuffing. “I do them the day before and I do it in small shapes and fry them, then all I’ve got to do is reheat them.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warningWeatherStorm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Ben McCarron scores a secon half penalty for Steelstown.

And they’re not alone – the research found a thirdof grandparents buy unsuitable gts for grandchildren at Christmas, closely followed by aunties , distant relativesand friends .  By asking yourself a few simple questions you can nail the art of gt-giving to both children and adults, promises Kim Brookes, who ran an online gt-registry for more than  years.   Have kids so that instead of real gts you can give friends and family novelty photo items with pictures of your children they saw on social media  months ago. — Some Boys MotherDecember ,    “Now’s the time to show your family just how much you love them by way of the perfect gt,” she says. “This is an opportunity not to be squandered, but one that causes a lot of stress at this time of year, as we really want to get it right.” Brookes, who now runs the natural scent jewellery brand, Perfino, suggests people choosing gts ask themselves these questions… . Do they really need it   Think about the person you’re buying for. You want to give them something that’s meaningful, not just for Christmas. Something that won’t be part of the re-gting cycle any time soon. So, it needs to be something they really want, rather than a short-term fad. “Subscriptions are a good option for this,” says Brookes. “Perhaps a comic or magazine – a gt that reminds them of you every month.” . Just because you love it, does that mean they will  Remember who you’re buying for and always keep their tastes and preferences at the forefront of your mind. “They may not want the chemistry set when their favourite subject is art, or the history book when they love nothing better than a murder mystery,” stresses Brookes.  . Have you really put proper thought into it  Don’t rush to buy something just because it’s there, without giving any thought to the person you’re buying for, says Brookes. “This is the worst offence,” she insists, “as it shows little consideration. Try to find some time to think long and hard about the child or person you’re buying for, and you’ll know what’ll make them happy, evenit’s not to your taste. Thankfully we’re all dferent.” . Have you gone too big    Brookes points out that while a gt recipient might love a trip to an adventure park for Christmas, and be a bit put out with a stick of deodorant, you’ll have a sense of what’s right. “And be very careful not to escalate,” she warns, “as you’ll be digging a hole for yourself on future gting occasions.” . Is it really eco-friendly  This question now has to be at the front of everyone’s minds, for your own satisfaction as well as the good of the planet, says Brookes. “I find the easiest way to do this is to trust who you’re buying from,” she says. “Most businesses will now put their eco credentials front and centre and,they don’t, look for one that does. Once you trust them, you can buy with an easy conscience.” . Have they already got it  If a potential gt is new and super-popular, it’s possible your gt recipient may already have it. If the gt’s for your own child, there’s a chance someone  may have bought it for them. “The best way forward could be to make some subtle enquiries,” advises Brookes, “andyou take the leap and buy, at least keep the receipt and be upfront about how happy you’d be to facilitate an exchange.”  . Are consumables a good choice   “We have so much at this time of year, so I’d avoid more chocolate, more sweets, more of anything unless it’s an extra-special treat – something they wouldn’t normally have, but which you know they’d enjoy,” suggests Brookes. . Are smellies always a winner  Smelly oils, creams etc may work for older children, teenagers and adults – but onlyyou know they like that sort of thing, warns Brookes, who says that, again, such items need to be really special to be a good gt. “Bath oil is my favourite thing,” she says, “but obviously it’s not for someone who only takes showers.” . Is it really appropriate  Consider whether something is age-appropriate for children and, of course, avoid anything made from plastic, stresses Brookes. . Is it going to look fabulous under the tree   It’s a minor consideration, but Brookes saysyou make the unwrapping experience a joyful one it can add that little bit of lovely Christmas sparkle to yourgt. “Ribbons, fabric, or even a drop of festive essential oil on the wrapping paper always work wonders,” she adds.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warningWeatherStorm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Ben McCarron scores a secon half penalty for Steelstown.

Is it really eco-friendly  This question now has to be at the front of everyone’s minds, for your own satisfaction as well as the good of the planet, says Brookes. “I find the easiest way to do this is to trust who you’re buying from,” she says. “Most businesses will now put their eco credentials front and centre and,they don’t, look for one that does. Once you trust them, you can buy with an easy conscience.” . Have they already got it  If a potential gt is new and super-popular, it’s possible your gt recipient may already have it. If the gt’s for your own child, there’s a chance someone  may have bought it for them. “The best way forward could be to make some subtle enquiries,” advises Brookes, “andyou take the leap and buy, at least keep the receipt and be upfront about how happy you’d be to facilitate an exchange.”  . Are consumables a good choice   “We have so much at this time of year, so I’d avoid more chocolate, more sweets, more of anything unless it’s an extra-special treat – something they wouldn’t normally have, but which you know they’d enjoy,” suggests Brookes. . Are smellies always a winner  Smelly oils, creams etc may work for older children, teenagers and adults – but onlyyou know they like that sort of thing, warns Brookes, who says that, again, such items need to be really special to be a good gt. “Bath oil is my favourite thing,” she says, “but obviously it’s not for someone who only takes showers.” . Is it really appropriate  Consider whether something is age-appropriate for children and, of course, avoid anything made from plastic, stresses Brookes. . Is it going to look fabulous under the tree   It’s a minor consideration, but Brookes saysyou make the unwrapping experience a joyful one it can add that little bit of lovely Christmas sparkle to yourgt. “Ribbons, fabric, or even a drop of festive essential oil on the wrapping paper always work wonders,” she adds.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warningWeatherStorm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Ben McCarron scores a secon half penalty for Steelstown.

It opened earlier this week and seeks to gain insights from stakeholders and the wider public on the best way to shape and develop the rail network across Ireland. Mr Durkan has encouraged local people and businesses to have their say by responding to the consultation. He said: “This public consultation is an exciting opportunity for everyone to have their say on the future of rail provision across Ireland. “This island once had a thriving railway network and since coming into office SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has committed to exploring an expanded railway network, which has the potential to be transformative for communities across our island. “The benefits of an overhaul of our current railway network are clear, it would allow us to address the regional imbalances that exist across the island, making our communities better connected and making rail a real option for people who regularly travel for work, to visit friends and family and to socialise. “It would also bring a boost for our economy, with poor public transport links regularly cited as a reason for the lack of investment outside our population centres. “More public transport options would also take more cars off our roads, which is a key part of plans to tackle the climate crisis and protect our environment. “I welcome SDLP Minister Mallon’s work on progressing this project so far and hope this public consultation marks the next step in making the revolution of our island’s rail network a reality. “I know this an issue many people in Derry feel very passionate about and would urge them not to miss this unique opportunity to give their view. “While other political parties are busy politicking, the SDLP is focused on delivering for people. After almost  years of Sinn Feacutein-DUP joint Government, the public deserve delivery. We’re up for the job.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warningWeatherStorm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Ben McCarron scores a secon half penalty for Steelstown.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warningWeatherStorm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Ben McCarron scores a secon half penalty for Steelstown.

Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warningWeatherStorm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Ben McCarron scores a secon half penalty for Steelstown.

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

The characters, Ralph , Susan , Finbarand Bettyget wind of Santas elves crashing the sled on a test run over the River Foyle and the reindeer have escaped. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is one and he makes his way inside Derrys Walls where he comes across an unscrupulous fake Santa Claus looking to use him to fleece the citys Christmas shoppers out of their cash. Robert,  and originally from Doagh in East Antrim, admitted the story started when he was making up a bedtime tale for his children and from there it grew into something more. He said: “Im not an author by profession although I have written other things. This is my first childrens story.  The author of a new childrens novel set in Derry, Sled Down!, Robert Campbell  “I have three young boys – Boyd , Henryand Adamand it was really a story that I told the children at bedtime and then I just sort of wrote it up properly and then published it. “The children seemed to enjoy my story. Generally they would give a pretty honest reaction on what they really think. Sothey enjoyed it, then maybe other children would too. “Without giving too much away about the plot, Santas elves have taken the sled out for a test run right before Christmas. “They have been messing about on the Foyle and have crashed the sled. “The animal children in the book get summoned by their headteacher, who has heard what has happened, to go and round up the loose reindeer and help get the sled back to their school in Culmore. “Meanwhile, around Derrys walls, there is a character who is a  Santa Claus and hes not very nice. “Hes managed to get a hold of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer himself and sets up a scheme to get people to have their picture taken with Rudolph for five pounds a go. “With Rudolph, the idea came about of where would he have gone to  following the sled crashing. “The bad Santa is not based on anyone in particular. Hes not really that bad except he is a bit of a chancer. Hes also up to a couple of other things that would not be classed as being environmentally friendly. “All the book is set in Derry. The walls get a mention as do the bridges where the elves are messing about with the sled. Culmore of course is mentioned as thats where the childrens school is. “Without giving too much away, like most Christmas tales, the day is saved by the children – although the real Santa makes an appearance as well.” Robert has been living in Derry for close to the last  years and admits that by setting the book in the city, he is paying homage to it. He added: “Im not actually from Derry myself. Im a blow-in from Doagh – near Ballyclare – in East Antrim. “My we is from Derry and Ive been living here for eleven or twelve years now. The book is probably a wee homage to Derry as well. “Its a lovely place up here. You could set a Christmas book anywhere but a festive story works perfectly well here. “Theres so many places in Derry that you could use for the book.” Robert Campbells book, “Sled Down!” is available to buy at Little Acorns Bookstore on Foyle Street, Derry or from Amazon at: https:www.amazon Sled-Down-friends-rescue-Christmas dp BKNZQN  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warningWeatherStorm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Ben McCarron scores a secon half penalty for Steelstown.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warningWeatherStorm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Ben McCarron scores a secon half penalty for Steelstown.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.    More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warningWeatherStorm Barra is named as Met Eacuteireann issues severe weather warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Ben McCarron scores a secon half penalty for Steelstown.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Stormy winds and snow in Met Eacuteireanns weather advisory for Ireland next week WeatherWEATHER ALERT: Snow and stormy weather set to hit Ireland as Met Eacuteireanns issues weather advisory for Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The Greencastle native played at the Brandywell between - and became one of the most beloved players in the club’s history in that time. After bursting onto the scene with a hat trick against Limerick in the promotion  relegation semi-finals in , Mark really came into his own following the arrival of Stephen Kenny a year later. Forming a lethal partnership with Gary Beckett, Mark was the lead goalscorer in one of the club’s most successful periods in the League of Ireland era, with City becoming a household name across Ireland and Europe in  and . Forced to retire due to a brain tumour, Mark scored the winning goal to hand Derry City the First Division title in what was supposed to be his final game for the club on a memorable and emotional night in Monaghan in . However, showing incredible fighting spirit, Mark ed to break Liam Coyle’s long-standing goal record with a hat trick against Mervue United in the FAI Cup in  to stand alone as the club’s most lethal hitman since entering the League of Ireland. Mark then moved to Glenavon before he was forced to retire again in , and he spent the next few years battling his illness alongside his family and we Terri before tragically passing away in , aged , after a brave battle with cancer.  Incredible le ‘The Love of the Game’ tells Mark’s story through the eyes of those who knew him best, and those who shared those precious moments with him on his journey through an incredible le. From his wicked sense of humour, to his hopes, fears and his amazing refusal to give up in the most dficult of circumstances, the story of Mark’s le is inspiring, hilarious and heart-breaking in equal measure. “Mark signied everything that was good about the human spirit,” Republic of Ireland manager Stephen Kenny says. “He was such a good person. I just loved his warmth, his humility and his smile and laughter around the group. “It was an amazing period and Mark Farren was our goal scorer. He was the player who scored the most goals. He was our first defender, our first line of attack who chased down every lost cause. He was prolic, he was quick, he was dynamic, he was skillful, he was inventive and he could score all types of goals. He could chip the goalkeeper, he could go around the keeper easily with his speed and control and he had a venomous left foot and accurate so he could score any type of goal.”  ‘Big goals’ Derry City manager Ruaidhri Higgins remembers Mark as the man for the big occasion. “He scored in cup finals, he scored on final days of the season Mark always scored in big games and big moments and always scored against the top teams as well,” he said. “You get lads who score lots of goals but they punish the lesser teams, whereas Mark scored a lot of big goals in big games and when you do that you are a hell of a player.” “When I signed for Bohemians, the likes of Jason McGuinness and Brian Shelley and Owen Heary always commented on how much they hated playing against Mark Farren. These are top players sometimes you can take your own team mates and players for granted, but that coming from opposition players who have won the lot, and for other players who constantly talk about Mark Farren highlights how good he was.” Former teammate Paddy McCourt rates Mark as one of the finest finishers he ever played alongside. “When I think of Mark Farren, the first thing that comes to mind is goals,” he added. “He was a ruthless finisher. He was a quiet, unassuming fella off the pitch, with a very dry but witty sense of humour. I always found him good company. He was quite happy to be in the background and be funny. “We had a lot of big characters in the dressing room at the time, so Mark would have been a quieter type of funny. He would have been happy to be playing pranks on people and joking about. I always found him really funny. He was just a great lad who loved being a footballer for Derry City. “I have been fortunate to play international football, I have been fortunate to play with some big clubs, but it was very rare in that time that I played with someone, who,they went through one on one, I was as confident as I was when I seen Mark Farren go through one on one. The goals that he got for Derry City speak volumes about that being true.” ‘The Love of the Game’ will be released in the coming days, with details of the launch set to come.

With  minutes played, the Maghera side trailed their Antrim counterparts by - to - and looked to be fading into the December chill. However, Thomas McKeagneys nd effort got St Pats moving again, and they had closed the gap to five points at the second half water break. When James Friels th minute free dropped straight to the net, it left just the minimum between the sides and Maghera outscored Garron Tower by - to - in the final ten minutes to take the spoils. The defeated St Killians side. The Derry men had started brightly too, and a Callum OKane brace had them - to - up after just five minutes, but a magnicent double save from Odhran McElhinney proved a warning for St Pats. Two huge frees from Joseph McLaughlin got St Killians off the mark, and after Niall McGarrell had put them ahead on  minutes, McLaughlins third gave them a - to - lead at the water break. Well in the ascendency, Garron Tower were swaggering, and hit three points in as many minutes from McLaughlin , Cormac McKeown and Niall McGarrell to extend the lead to five points. James Friel hit back with two long range frees, but a long range Padraig McKillop effort in stoppage time saw St Killians lead by - to - at the break. The Antrim side continued where they left off in the second half, another brace of McLaughlin frees and a McGarrell effort opening up a seven-point lead, but then things began to turn.  St Pats Knock out Our Ladys to reach Mageean semi final  The Maghera school will now meet St Killians, Garron Tower in the semi final.   Thomas McKeagney punched the air after hitting St Pats first second half score on  minutes, and Callum OKane wriggled free to point and leave them trailing - to - at the water break. Corner back Conor Shiels raised a roar from his team with a long-range free on  minutes to close the gap to three, before St Pats got the little bit of luck they were craving. James Friel sent in a long free, and despite several swinging hurls, the ball floated over them all and into the net. Another Shiels free levelled matters in the th minute, but the expected St Killians backlash never came, and McKeagney nudged Maghera in front on  minutes. A sublime sideline cut from Eoin Scullion doubled the lead three minutes later, before Conor Shiels third free opened a - to - gap. Only a goal would do for Garron Tower, but they watched in disappointment as Seanie McIntosh’s attempt at dropping the ball into the box floated over the bar, and Conor Shiels restored the three-point margin with a nd minute free, his fourth of the day. A satisfying comeback for the Maghera side, who will now contest a Mageean Cup final with either St Louis Ballymena or St Patricks Downpatrick, who meet at the Dub on Friday night.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Dec Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Steelstown - Donaghmoyne -                                  googletag.cmd.push  Steelstown overcame a three-point half-time deficit to race to a -point victory in their Ulster Championship quarter-final tie against Donaghmoyne at Celtic Park. Hugh McGrath’s team produced an emphatic second half performance to stun their Monaghan opponents just when it seemed that they were in trouble after a dficult first period. The first half started extremely well for Brian Ogs who replied to Davy Garland’s point by putting the ball in the net with their first attack, Eoghan Bradley hammering in from close range after good work by Gareth Logue. But Donaghmoyne responded strongly with two goals of their own in the space of seven minutes. Ronan McDonald got the better of Kevin Lindsay before firing through Eoghan Heraghty’s legs, and Liam McDonald then fired home from the penalty spot after Eoghan Concannon had fouled Davy Garland. Steelstown were too reckless with their shooting, five unforced wides, and they went  minutes without scoring as Donaghamoyne took control – McDonald and Garland scoring to put four points between them as half time approached. McCarron’s score on  minutes took it down to -, - with Steelstown needing a signicant improvement in the second half. The game was turned on its head completely as two goals in the first seven minutes contributed to a seven-point swing in the scoreline. Both goals came from Cahir McMonagle, scoring just seconds after throw-in before finding the net a second time after picking up a loose shot from Ben McCarron. Further scores from Oran McManamin, Oran Fox and McMonagle sent Steelstown -,  clear before Garland hit back after an -minute drought for Donaghmoyne. Steelstown’s lead increased when Niall Meegan hauled down Diarmuid Baker, and Ben McCarron slotted in from the penalty spot. Morgan Murray came off the bench to score two points and Donncha Gilmore had the last say as Steelstown cruised to victory.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Dec Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Steelstown - Donaghmoyne -                                  googletag.cmd.push  Steelstown overcame a three-point half-time deficit to race to a -point victory in their Ulster Championship quarter-final tie against Donaghmoyne at Celtic Park. Hugh McGrath’s team produced an emphatic second half performance to stun their Monaghan opponents just when it seemed that they were in trouble after a dficult first period. The first half started extremely well for Brian Ogs who replied to Davy Garland’s point by putting the ball in the net with their first attack, Eoghan Bradley hammering in from close range after good work by Gareth Logue. But Donaghmoyne responded strongly with two goals of their own in the space of seven minutes. Ronan McDonald got the better of Kevin Lindsay before firing through Eoghan Heraghty’s legs, and Liam McDonald then fired home from the penalty spot after Eoghan Concannon had fouled Davy Garland. Steelstown were too reckless with their shooting, five unforced wides, and they went  minutes without scoring as Donaghamoyne took control – McDonald and Garland scoring to put four points between them as half time approached. McCarron’s score on  minutes took it down to -, - with Steelstown needing a signicant improvement in the second half. The game was turned on its head completely as two goals in the first seven minutes contributed to a seven-point swing in the scoreline. Both goals came from Cahir McMonagle, scoring just seconds after throw-in before finding the net a second time after picking up a loose shot from Ben McCarron. Further scores from Oran McManamin, Oran Fox and McMonagle sent Steelstown -,  clear before Garland hit back after an -minute drought for Donaghmoyne. Steelstown’s lead increased when Niall Meegan hauled down Diarmuid Baker, and Ben McCarron slotted in from the penalty spot. Morgan Murray came off the bench to score two points and Donncha Gilmore had the last say as Steelstown cruised to victory.

Gemma Doherty and Morgana MacIntyre, Reporter: Domhnall MacDermott Dec   addthis, Fresh from winning Album of the Year at the NI Music Awards, the Derry Belfast duo Saint Sister are destined for big things. The group, made up of Derry born singer harpist Gemma Doherty, of the Delacroix Dohertys, and Belfast-born singer Morgana MacIntyre, are currently playing their first tour in almost two years. googletag.cmd.push I caught up with Gemma after their triumphant Nerve Centre debut last weekend: What’s it like playing for crowds again after a year of livestreams  “It was amazing to see creative people come together and make some really special online shows in the absence of live music. “That said, it’s hard to beat the feeling of people coming together and experiencing something live in a room. “I really missed the feedback you get from the audience and how that feeds into the performance. “It can completely dictate the energy of a show, and that’s just not something you can create with only cameras in the room. “I think we’ve been a lot less nervous chatting and engaging with the audience since everything has opened back up, and we’re a lot more aware of being in the moment since it was taken away from us for a while.” Which do you prefer  Stripped down shows or playing with the full band  “I absolutely love playing the shows with the full band, especially with the seven-piece or the -piece band that we got to play with for our album livestream back in June. It’s a dream to hear the full scale of the album arrangements behind us when we’re on stage. “But I’ve been really enjoying the run of more intimate two-piece shows that we’ve been playing over the last few weeks. “When you strip the songs right back to their core, it becomes all about the vocals and finding the journey of each song with just one instrument behind it. “ We seem to lock into a dferent kind of flow and it feels like we’re engaging with the audience on a dferent level.” What was it like opening for Keane in America before lockdown  “It was great craic. Those were some of the biggest venues we’d ever played and the crowds and venues were beautul. “The last show we played in the states was in the stunning Dolby Theatre in LA where the Oscars had been held just a few weeks before. “It was supposed to be a  date tour, but we got to play  shows on the West Coast before things started closing down and we had to come home.” What’s been the best part of touring again and why was it playing Derry  “Hearing people sing along to the tunes from the second album has been really special, and as I mentioned before, being able to feel the audience in the room again and react to their energy. Derry was a class gig, we loved it. “It’s always a bit nerve-racking playing in your hometown, the stakes feel higher. “But it was the warmest welcome we could have asked for, and the same in Morgan’s hometown Belfast the following night.” Did you make any changes to the new album after lockdown delayed it’s release  “Thankfully we had just got our final mixes back around the beginning of March , and by the time the first lockdown hit we were already getting it mastered. It would have been so tempting to go back in and tweak it endlessly with the perceived extra time that lockdown gave us. I’m grateful in a way that it was finished before all that, and that it got to stay true to itself before the world went a bit mad.” How did it feel to win the NI Music Award’s Album of the Year   “Thank you! There were so many great albums out this year so we were genuinely shocked when it was announced. We missed the ceremony in the Ulster Hall unfortunately as we had a show in Waterford that night but we came off stage and looked at our phones and got a lovely surprise! And we got to celebrate properly a few nights later with the hometown shows in Derry and Belfast.” Other Voices is  this year.

Spring: Sunday, The Horror Channel @ pm A disastrous personal le has Evan in a tizzy so he does a legger from the United States to Italy and its here he meets an unusual woman called Louise and a dalliance with her makes his existence back in America look rather normal. A film you want to watch knowing as little about it as possible. Its fun, atmospheric and it will lurk in your head for a while. The fact that its on the horror channel will clue you in. Lou Taylor Pucci andNadia Hilker work well together. Last Orders: Sunday, Film @ pm Jack has passed away and his friends are in mourning. He went out with a smile and one final wish - that his friends get together once more to reminisce and scatter his ashes over the beach he loved so well. An elegant, touching and humane look at the pleasures and hardships of lelong friendships told wonderfully by director Fred Schepisi and a stunner of a cast that includes Michael Caine, Helen Mirren, Ray Winston, Bob Hoskins and Tom Courtenay. Brighton Rock: Monday, Talking PicturesTV@ pm Pinkys the leader of a gang in pre-war Brighton. Hes a nasty piece of work and a run-in with a journalist causes big problems for him and for a naive young waitress named Rose whos witness to what he has done. This  adaption of Graham Greens celebrated novel is still a tense, nerve wracking and affecting watch  years later. A baby faced Richard Attenborough does memorable work in the lead role. Topsy Turvy: Monday, Film @ .pm Gilbert and Sullivan. A partnership for the ages. The men behind so many famous operas of the th century. Their work didnt always come easy to them though and Topsy Turvy gives us a peek behind their stage curtains. Mike Leighs  musical drama might be almost  hours long but its very entertaining and satisfying and in the company of actors like Timothy Spall, Jim Broadbent, Lesley Manville and Shirley Henderson the time flies Farming: Tuesday, Channel  @ .am A young Nigerian boy is sent by his family to England in the s to be raised in a white household. It was a practice known as farming, an attempt to give poor African children a better chance at le. It left some of them with a very confused look at their own racial identity. Based on directorAdewale Akinnuoye-Agbajes own le, its a raw and disturbing coming of age story and a damning indictment of the British governments warped policies. Damson Idris is an excellent lead. Tully: Tuesday, Film @ .pm Marlos struggling. Three kids are taking their toll on her and her marriage. A nanny is hired. An unusual nanny named Tully. A strange bond forms between the two women. Tully comes from the pen of Diablo Cody so its no surprise that it delves into myriad aspects of womanhood rarely seen on screen and that paired with fine turns from Charlize Theron and Mackenzie Davis makes it really worth a watch Catch And Release: Wednesday, Great! Movies @ .am On the day she was supposed to get married Gray finds herself at the funeral of the man she loved. She has no money and nowhere to live and has to move in with his room mates and soon finds out she didnt know him as well as she thought. This  romcom is enjoyableyou can zone out Kevin Smith as one of the room mates. Jenner Garner and Timothy Olyphant do good enough work together to help you ignore the eejit in the corner. Free State Of Jones: Wednesday, BBC two @ .pm Alienated by the confederation, a soldier deserts his post during the American civil war and together with farmers and freed slaves creates a new state. Things do not go smoothly. Gary Rosss  film is a vivid recreation of an era of American history that rarely gets mentioned. Its as brutal and ugly as youd expect but superb acting from Matthew McConnaughey, Gugu Mbatha-Raw  Mahershala Ali eases the pain. Another Year: Thursday, Channel  @ am Gerri and Tom are living a quiet, contented le and looking forward to the freedom that comes with retirement but their orced and unhappy friend Mary is becoming an increasingly large presence in their lives. The second Mike Leigh film of the week is too no big surprise another cracker, a deep e into the minutiae of everyday lives and loves that doesnt need fake drama to make its point. Ruth Sheen, Jim Broadbent and Lesley Manville are all impeccable. The Manchurian Candidate: Thursday, BBC @ pm Prisoners of warfrom capture in the Korean War to America. But all is not well. To say anymore might spoil a magnicent piece of neo-noir. A truly suspenseful film, intelligent, inventive, paranoid, complex and deeply layered. Fabulous acting abounds. Frank Sinatra gives one of his best performances but the star of the show is Angela Lansbury. Her character is quite the creation, you wont be able to look away from her. Lawman: Friday, TG @ .pm A marshal arrives into a town to arrest the troublemakers who caused the death of an old man in his town. The townsfolk arent going to make things easy for him though. A hoary old revenge story is the basis of this blistering western and its one that effortlessly bridges the gap between the old fashioned westerns of the s and the dark and violent ones of the s. Burt Lancaster, Lee J. Cobb, Robert Ryan and Robert Duvall, all old hands at this genre, are all in fine form here. Wild Nights With Emily: Friday, Film @ .pm Not much is known about the personal le of Emily Dickinson, the th century American poet. She was long considered an eccentric loner by her neighbours inMassachusetts but Madeleine Olneks  romcom tells us a dferent version of her story. A surprisingly touching and warm look at how secrets are kept and how legends are created powered by strong turns from Molly Shannon, Amy Seimetz and Susan Zeigler. The Leisure Seeker: Friday RTEacute One @ .pm The Leisure Seeker is the name of Ella and Johns RV and it becomes their home when they decide to drive from Boston to Key West in an attempt to revisit older, better times.

Spring: Sunday, The Horror Channel @ pm A disastrous personal le has Evan in a tizzy so he does a legger from the United States to Italy and its here he meets an unusual woman called Louise and a dalliance with her makes his existence back in America look rather normal. A film you want to watch knowing as little about it as possible. Its fun, atmospheric and it will lurk in your head for a while. The fact that its on the horror channel will clue you in. Lou Taylor Pucci andNadia Hilker work well together. Last Orders: Sunday, Film @ pm Jack has passed away and his friends are in mourning. He went out with a smile and one final wish - that his friends get together once more to reminisce and scatter his ashes over the beach he loved so well. An elegant, touching and humane look at the pleasures and hardships of lelong friendships told wonderfully by director Fred Schepisi and a stunner of a cast that includes Michael Caine, Helen Mirren, Ray Winston, Bob Hoskins and Tom Courtenay. Brighton Rock: Monday, Talking PicturesTV@ pm Pinkys the leader of a gang in pre-war Brighton. Hes a nasty piece of work and a run-in with a journalist causes big problems for him and for a naive young waitress named Rose whos witness to what he has done. This  adaption of Graham Greens celebrated novel is still a tense, nerve wracking and affecting watch  years later. A baby faced Richard Attenborough does memorable work in the lead role. Topsy Turvy: Monday, Film @ .pm Gilbert and Sullivan. A partnership for the ages. The men behind so many famous operas of the th century. Their work didnt always come easy to them though and Topsy Turvy gives us a peek behind their stage curtains. Mike Leighs  musical drama might be almost  hours long but its very entertaining and satisfying and in the company of actors like Timothy Spall, Jim Broadbent, Lesley Manville and Shirley Henderson the time flies Farming: Tuesday, Channel  @ .am A young Nigerian boy is sent by his family to England in the s to be raised in a white household. It was a practice known as farming, an attempt to give poor African children a better chance at le. It left some of them with a very confused look at their own racial identity. Based on directorAdewale Akinnuoye-Agbajes own le, its a raw and disturbing coming of age story and a damning indictment of the British governments warped policies. Damson Idris is an excellent lead. Tully: Tuesday, Film @ .pm Marlos struggling. Three kids are taking their toll on her and her marriage. A nanny is hired. An unusual nanny named Tully. A strange bond forms between the two women. Tully comes from the pen of Diablo Cody so its no surprise that it delves into myriad aspects of womanhood rarely seen on screen and that paired with fine turns from Charlize Theron and Mackenzie Davis makes it really worth a watch Catch And Release: Wednesday, Great! Movies @ .am On the day she was supposed to get married Gray finds herself at the funeral of the man she loved. She has no money and nowhere to live and has to move in with his room mates and soon finds out she didnt know him as well as she thought. This  romcom is enjoyableyou can zone out Kevin Smith as one of the room mates. Jenner Garner and Timothy Olyphant do good enough work together to help you ignore the eejit in the corner. Free State Of Jones: Wednesday, BBC two @ .pm Alienated by the confederation, a soldier deserts his post during the American civil war and together with farmers and freed slaves creates a new state. Things do not go smoothly. Gary Rosss  film is a vivid recreation of an era of American history that rarely gets mentioned. Its as brutal and ugly as youd expect but superb acting from Matthew McConnaughey, Gugu Mbatha-Raw  Mahershala Ali eases the pain. Another Year: Thursday, Channel  @ am Gerri and Tom are living a quiet, contented le and looking forward to the freedom that comes with retirement but their orced and unhappy friend Mary is becoming an increasingly large presence in their lives. The second Mike Leigh film of the week is too no big surprise another cracker, a deep e into the minutiae of everyday lives and loves that doesnt need fake drama to make its point. Ruth Sheen, Jim Broadbent and Lesley Manville are all impeccable. The Manchurian Candidate: Thursday, BBC @ pm Prisoners of warfrom capture in the Korean War to America. But all is not well. To say anymore might spoil a magnicent piece of neo-noir. A truly suspenseful film, intelligent, inventive, paranoid, complex and deeply layered. Fabulous acting abounds. Frank Sinatra gives one of his best performances but the star of the show is Angela Lansbury. Her character is quite the creation, you wont be able to look away from her. Lawman: Friday, TG @ .pm A marshal arrives into a town to arrest the troublemakers who caused the death of an old man in his town. The townsfolk arent going to make things easy for him though. A hoary old revenge story is the basis of this blistering western and its one that effortlessly bridges the gap between the old fashioned westerns of the s and the dark and violent ones of the s. Burt Lancaster, Lee J. Cobb, Robert Ryan and Robert Duvall, all old hands at this genre, are all in fine form here. Wild Nights With Emily: Friday, Film @ .pm Not much is known about the personal le of Emily Dickinson, the th century American poet. She was long considered an eccentric loner by her neighbours inMassachusetts but Madeleine Olneks  romcom tells us a dferent version of her story. A surprisingly touching and warm look at how secrets are kept and how legends are created powered by strong turns from Molly Shannon, Amy Seimetz and Susan Zeigler. The Leisure Seeker: Friday RTEacute One @ .pm The Leisure Seeker is the name of Ella and Johns RV and it becomes their home when they decide to drive from Boston to Key West in an attempt to revisit older, better times. A poignant watch that doesnt skimp on the realities of growing old while at the same time shows us a type of love and understanding that only exists after decades of being together. Helen Mirren and Donald Sutherland work very well together as the leads.

Those behind the initiative have a long-term focus on addressing the pressing need for the transformation of our high streets.ldquoThe welcome initiative provides an important opportunity for everyone to have their say and influence the vision that will be required to breathe new le into high streets across the Newry, Mourne and Down area which will be crucial in a post-Covid world.Cllr Curran added: ldquoSadly, many of our businesses have borne the brunt of the pandemic and anything that can be done to help them and increase footfall in our town and villages is particularly welcome. The visit of the task force team is an opportunity that must be grasped with both hands.The call for evidence document is available at https:www.executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk consultations call-evidence-high-street-task-force, while responses to the call for evidence can be made to highstreet@communities-ni.gov.uk..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Chris cranks up Christmas fun  ","story":"TURKEYS, toys, nostalgia and noise are on the menu which will be served up on the Chris Scott Show on FM Down Community Radio tonight.Join Chris from -pm as he chats with Killyleagh butcher Alfie Murray, who talks about the le of a turkey in the run-up to Christmas mdash and also suggests a few good cooking tips.Chris then goes to Newcastle where he pops into Thumbelina, a traditional toy shop, and meets with its proprietor, Audrey Byrne.

The resulting spot kick was coolly dispatched again by Robinson.At the beginning of the second half Omagh pulled level again and the sidelines were a hive of activity, with changes being rung by both sides.Left-back Jack Kelly delivered a deep cross into the Omagh box and the hardworking Tom Crudington recycled it out to Calam Mulqueen, who made no mistake when called upon to put Down High - ahead with the clock running low.But once again Down High became complacent as Omagh turned the screw and won countless corners. The pressure took its toll and a thoroughly deserved equaliser left the tie at - with the visitors left wondering what had gone wrong.At this stage, goalkeeper Alex Truesdale was busy keeping his side in the game and made one miraculous point blank save, resembling Jerzy Dudekrsquos heroics for Liverpool in the  Champions League final.Extra-time loomed large and with the floodlights now on both sides knew that one mistake or a well-placed pass could be decisive.After a cautious start to extra-time, Caolan Lennon stepped up to take a free-kick and scored a simply stunning goal into the top corner of the Omagh goal mdasha tremendous -yard thunder strike that encapsulated his class throughout the game.Omagh Academy pushed to get back into the game and were caught on the counter when that man Robinson pounced and rounded the rsquokeeper to score and put somne breathing space between the sides.Robinsonrsquos goalscoring exploits won him the man-of-the-match award, with Mulqueenrsquos midfield battling also worthy of high commendation.Lennon was a constant thorn in Omaghrsquos side while mazy runs from Josh Ward caught the eye, with Josh McMullan working hard too. Jamie Ferguson and Matthew Nelson also battled hard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Dunleath parkrun plans edging

the globe, the proposed Downpatrick parkrun also has the potential to provide the local economy with a boost.Downpatrick Town Committee is behind the ambitious plan for the new parkrun which it believes will bring the local community closer together and may encourage people who have never run before to get out and enjoy themselves in an event where there is no time limit and no one finishes last.Last month, the Town Committee issued an online appeal for ldquoenthusiastic and committed volunteers to come forward to help get the parkrun up and running and itrsquos hoped that the parkrun could become a weekly event and attract people from across the district to enhance their health and enjoy the great outdoors.Downpatrick area councillor Gareth Sharvin has welcomed the progress on establishing a parkrun event at Dunleath Park.He said parkruns have become popular with runners and walkers alike across the country and keen participants in the Downpatrick area have been planning the establishment of a similar event in the county town.Cllr Sharvin confirmed that he recently requested an update from Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities department on the progress of establishing the parkrunand providing financial support to the group setting up the event.ldquoI am happy to report that the financial contribution and approach has been agreed between all stakeholders and officers are working with the parkrun organisers to finalise the details, he said.ldquoWith this great news, it should not be long until we have our first parkrun event in Downpatrick, utilising the new trail around Dunleath.Cllr Sharvin added: ldquoA parkrun will also bring people from outside the area into Downpatrick spending locally in our shops and cafes, adding to our great array of social and leisure activities on offer.News that Dunleath Park could host the parkrun comes after recent confirmation that major investment is planned for this part of the town.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is planning to create a series of new facilities, including a dedicated running track, while also in the pipeline are a cycling pump track, skateboarding track, improved planting and a new play park.In addition, soccer and GAA pitches are in line for an upgrade as part of the plan to transform Dunleath Park into a sporting and recreational hub.Itrsquos understood that the area earmarked for the proposed pump track, skateboard track and play park sit outside the parkrsquos floodplain and will enable the local authority to move faster in putting a business case together and progress towards securing capital funding.The need for new G or G pitches mdash which can be used all year round mdash at Dunleath Park also been highlighted with council

Together we can put a stop to illegal puppy farming. Buying a puppy from illegal breeders can have devastating results, she continued.ldquoOften puppies die a short time after purchase or end up with infectious diseases such as parvovirus which is expensive to treat and, often fatal. They can also suffer behavioural issues relating to fear and anxiety due to poor or no socialisation.Chief Inspector Ford said it can be tempting to buy a puppy in these circumstances and often purchasers will recognise that things are not quite right, asking people to remember that by lsquorescuingrsquo a puppy in these circumstances, they are fuelling and supporting what is a particularly lucrative criminal industry.She added: ldquoWe would encourage anyone who is aware of illegal dog breeding establishments to contact their local council and we would like to take this opportunity to thank those that have done so to date already.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason said the local authority was committed to working with its partners to address this issue.ldquoWe investigate all reports made to us, she said. ldquoRecently, animal welfare officers seized seven dogs from a property following reports the animals were kept in poor living conditions and a further  dogs were seized at an illegal puppy farm with associated poor environmental conditions.Cllr Mason said the local authority is currently investigating a case of failing to ensure the welfare needs of dogs and causing unnecessary suffering.She continued: ldquoThis is a particularly timely message at this time of year when many will be thinking of purchasing a puppy for Christmas.ldquoCouncils are the lead agency when it comes to animal welfare issues and we routinely work with other agencies such as police and Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to help us tackle this serious issue.Cllr Mason also asked people across the district for their help.She added: ldquoIf anyone sees or is are aware of anything untoward, please report it to your localcouncil dog warden immediately so we can take appropriate action and seek assistance from relevant partners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13261517.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Top left is the M towards Antrim, top right M bridge to Bangor, and bottom is WestlinkIt was written by the roads expert Wesley Johnston . The online version of this article links to it, see below.Wesley is an astute analyst of roads infrastructure, and he runs a website devoted to Northern Ireland’s highways - both those that have been built in recent years, those that are being built, and those that are planned.My heart sank when I read Wesley’s analsysis of the proposals to join three of NI’s busiest routes - the M, the Westlink M, and the M bridge - in a seamless interchange that will remove all traffic lights and all obstacles.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.He concluded that the scheme was now unlikely to proceed in its current form.I have had concerns about this vital project for many years, given the delays and reviews.Only last month a Belfast City Council committee voted to withdraw its support from the plans.Stormont’s infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon of the SDLP, has seemed, as Wesley put it, “lukewarm about York Street Interchange from the outset”.One of her predecessors, Sinn Fein’s Chris Hazzard, wanted to emphasise projects west of the Bann, such as the A.It seems that some politicians in the Alliance Party have turned against the York Street plan too.There are a number of reasons for the new coolness towards the interchange, including the growing interest in environmental matters and the changes to lestyle and travel patterns caused by Cocid.I wonderin some quarters there is an extra layer of hostility to the £ million project because the DUP secured funding for it as part of its agreement to sustain the Conservative Party in power in . This would be a disappointing outlookso, because the DUP was rightly praised for seeking financial support that would benefit the whole community, rather than just unionists, when it struck a deal with Theresa May after the general election of that year.There are some dubious ideas that are emerging now about road projects.The first is that it is automatically a good thing to constrain vehicle traffic in order to make way for cyclists and pedestrians and buses.It is indeed a good idea to do that in many contexts, particularly in urban areas. But often such changes help people who are young and able bodied and who live in densely populated areas.They do not help, say, a single mother in the suburbs who has to take her children to school in one direction in the rain, then travel in the other to a job in which it is not possible to work from home.It does not help an elderly person who lives in a rural area who depends on a car for their mobility and whose home is located in such a sparsely populated location that there is no prospect, ever of regular public transport services.In other words, it is not necessarily a selfish thing to want to run a car, as some of the more hardcore environmental scolds imply.In fact cars are one of the greatest advances in human history and have enabled people around the world to live much more liberated lives than they did only decades ago, when poorer people were unable to afford to travel far from their home.Covid has caused changes in lestyle pattern changes that should be welcomed, such as the increased flexibility caused by many people working from home. This will reduce rush hour congestion and will enable people to live far further from their work places and so should lead to a more even spread in property prices between town and country.Yet we have also seen that the desire that people have to use their car has — inevitably — come roaring back. Therefore we need to focus on making cars more environmentally efficient, and to make roads better too.The first part of that equation was happening anyway. When I was born in the US in the s, cars were grossly inefficient because petrol was so cheap. Now cars get two or three times more miles to the gallon than they did. Electric cars and other innovations will make this even better.But good, freeflowing trunk roads are an environmental boost too.In fact they can go in tandem with restrictions to traffic in towns and cities.I think we need more mph limits in urban areas, perhaps enforced by speed cameras, but more so-called expresswayswith mph limits to get between towns.The York St junction is a key example of this. We do not want traffic that is going from Stormont to West Belfast to crawl through city streets. We want it to travel on a ring road so that we can make those city streets more friendly to local and slower traffic.Not only should York St be built, we should be planing a free flowing junction at Tillysburn too and indeed a freer flowing outer ring road, ideally all the way round past Forestside and out towards the M near Lisburn, where traffic can then rejoin the ‘ring road’ back towards Belfast and the Westlink.Ms Mallon’s review of York Street which was completed this year recommended that the project think more broadly about its impacts on the local area. But the immediate vicinity of the road has been a noisy, congested junction for decades and will never cease to be so. The interchange would have made it easier to cross from the city centre to north Belfast by foot or bicycle by separating such traffic from the junction.As to the A, it too should be built, because such roads are far safer than single carriageways.

Clockwise from top left, David Lloyd George Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, , Winston Churchill, Robert Barton, Michael Collins, Arthur GrfithLock it up carefully”, David Lloyd George said to his mistress and secretary, Frances Stevenson, in her room at  Downing Street, as he handed her the British copy of the historic Anglo-Irish Treaty just before  am on  December .Under its terms the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, as created by Pitt the Younger  years earlier, came to an end. Only the six counties of the newly formed Northern Ireland were to be permitted to remain within the United Kingdom. Their devolved Parliament, which had been opened by King George V the previous June , was given the power to vote them out of the all-Ireland settlement, based on dominion status, which the Treaty embodied.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The document that was locked away in Downing Street bore the signatures of four members of the British delegation who had negotiated it. They formed a column headed by Lloyd George himself the others, drawn from his Liberal  Unionist coalition cabinet, were Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, Lord Birkenhead , and Winston Churchill.Another column listed the signatures of three of their Irish counterparts, headed by Arthur Grfith, the founder of Sinn Fein in , and followed by the charismatic Michael Collins, the chief organiser of the IRA’s terrorist campaign against Britain, waged from  until July  when a truce was agreed between the two sides. The third Irish signatory, Robert Barton, a Unionist landowner turned Republican and an intimate friend of Collins, was the Sinn Fein delegation’s economic adviser. Never before had British and Irish representatives put their names to a formal agreement of this kind as complete equals. After the signing, which took place at . am, the two sides shook hands for the first time. Trust had replaced the deep suspicion with which they had first regarded each other. Irish leaders, who a few months earlier had been denounced as rebels and murderers, had come to enjoy the respect of the British delegation. Michael Collins had undergone an astonishing transformation from terrorist leader to statesman, gaining the admiration of two prominent members of the British team, Churchill and Birkenhead.Final agreement on the terms of the treaty had been reached in two intense negotiating sessions in the Cabinet Room at No , which ended two months of wrangling. The first session, which lasted over five hours, began at pm on December . Lloyd George employed all his formidable political skills to secure a breakthrough in all but one of the key areas that had hitherto defied resolution.The Irish gained the full fiscal and financial autonomy they craved. The British got what they wanted on defence: the use “in time of war or of strained relations with a foreign power [of] such harbour and other facilities as the British government may require”, combined with the permanent retention of what came to be known as the Treaty Ports , major strategic assets which Neville Chamberlainwas to abandon in a further Anglo-Irish Treaty in  to Churchill’s fury. Since the start of negotiations in October, the words of an oath of allegiance which Irish elected representatives would in future be required to swear had been through endless drafts. It was at last settled with a suitably convoluted rigmarole to spare the Irish republican conscience as much strain as possible: “I will be faithful to His Majesty King George V, his Heirs and Successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland and Great Britain, and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.” This was the first time on which the customary reference to Empire was dropped from an official document.There remained just one make-or-break issue: Northern Ireland, with its devolved powers over local matters entrusted to it by Westminster earlier in . Sinn Fein were determined to get it into their independent state. Lloyd George was happy to give them all the help he could. In November, he had piled pressure on Sir James Craig, the Northern Ireland prime minister. In letters and conversations he tried, with all his accustomed craftiness, to get Craig to accept that he had a patriotic duty to remove the last barrier to peace in Ireland by joining a sovereign all-Ireland Parliament in place of Westminster, while retaining all the devolved powers that Westminster had provided.The Unionist members of the British delegation did not demur. Not for the last time, Ulster Unionists found that they could not rely on their English Unionist allies in high places . Austen Chamberlain said that separate arrangements for six of the nine Ulster counties were “illogical and indefensible”. He thought “the greatest moral pressure” should be put on Northern Ireland to bring it into a settlement that was “vital to the Empire”. His party chairman, Sir George Younger , believed “Ulster should take some risks and forget some of the past arguments against unity in Ireland”.These Unionist calls for compromisewere made against the background of a sustained press campaign, led by The Times, criticising Ulster Unionists for their intransigence. “Ulster blocks the way to peace” was the newspapers’ regular refrain. Craig described it as “ a press campaign against Ulster without parallel in the history of Great Britain.”But the Northern Ireland premier was unmoved. He told Lloyd George that a single parliament for Ireland was “precisely what Ulster has for many years resisted by all the means at her disposal”.Lloyd George tried another tack in November, concentrating his cunning this time on the leader of the Irish delegation, Arthur Grfith. Here he had much greater success than in his attempts to manoeuvre Craig into an all-Ireland parliament. At a private meeting with Grfith on November , he got the leader of the Irish delegation to give a personal written pledge that,Northern Ireland refused to accept an all-Ireland settlement, it would remain under the British Parliament, “but in this case, it would be necessary to revise the boundary of Northern Ireland. This might be done by a Boundary Commission ... to make the boundary conform as closely as possible to the wishes of the people.” What went unrecorded in the paper was the clear impression given by Lloyd George that Northern Ireland would lose so much territory that it could not survive as a separate entity and a united independent Ireland would as a result come into existence.During the course of the long afternoon session in Downing Street on December , Lloyd George reminded Grfith of what they had agreed.Proof was needed. A frantic search was made of the prime minister’s wardrobe, and “eventually an insignicant pocket cast up an envelope and a piece of paper.” On the strength of this written undertaking to establish a Boundary Commission whichwould undermine Northern Ireland, the leader of the Irish delegation agreed to sign the Treaty himself, but said that he could not commit his colleagues.At this, Lloyd George assumed a magnicently melodramatic air. He had told Craig in Belfast to expect news of the outcome of the discussions in Downing Street the following day. That could of course have been done by telephone, but Lloyd George now conjured up an elaborate plan to send the news in writing to Belfast in an attempt to force a decision out of the other two Irish delegates.“Here are the alternative letters which I have prepared, one enclosing Articles of Agreement reached by His Majesty’s Government and yourselves, and the other saying that the Sinn Fein representatives refuse to come within the Empire. If I send this letter it is war, and war within three days. Which letter am I to send  Whichever letter you choose travels by special train to Holyhead, and by destroyer to Belfast. The train is waiting with steam up at Euston ... to reach Sir James in time we must know your answer by ten p.m tonight. You can have until then, but no longer, to decide whether you will give peace or war to your country.”With these impassioned words ringing in their ears, the Irish delegates ed to their Knightsbridge hotel for anguished discussions amongst themselves, but promised to be back in Downing Street by the pm deadline. In fact, it was nearly .pm when they ed.Nothing more was heard about the special train waiting at Euston. Grfith announced calmly, “Prime Minister, the Delegation is willing to sign the agreements, but there are a few points of drafting which perhaps it would be convenientI mentioned at once.” The most important concerned the Boundary Commission redrafting increasedthe likelihood that Northern Ireland would collapse. At Iam on December , an agreed text was handed to the Downing Street typists.In England, reaction to the treaty was ecstatic. The Times led the way: “These are fitting peace terms to mark the close of an age of discontent and distrust, and the beginning of a new era of happiness and mutual understanding.” In Ireland, discontent intensied and took a new form: the long quarrel with Britain was replaced by distrust and ision within Sinn Fein, which led to a bitter civil war the following year. In Northern Ireland, IRA terrorism increased, generating sectarian stre in  parts of Belfast came to resemble the battlefields of the First World War. The Boundary Commission recommended only minor changes, and its report was shelved. Englishmen looked away. “The country”, said Austen Chamberlain, “wants peace and is tired of Ireland and Ulster.” English politicians hoped they would never have to think seriously about Irish affairs again. For nearly  years they had their wish — which meant that that they were fatally handicapped by ignorance when the Ulster crisis of  erupted.l BIBLIOGRAPHY—D.G.Boyce, Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy -and “ How to Settle the Irish Question: Lloyd George and Ireland -” in A.J.P.

Two cases of the Omicron iant were located in Nottingham and Brentford in Essex. Scientists are concerned that the vaccines may not be protective against this iant.What does this mean for me If youfrom any country outside of the UK, you will have to take a PCR test and isolate until the test result is negative.However,you come from a red list country - Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, you will not be able to enter Wales.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe region remains the only part of the UK where hunting wild mammals with dogs is still permitted.A private membersrsquo bill brought by Alliance MLA John Blair aims to bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK.However the Countryside Alliance has urged MLAs to vote against the bill, describing it as ldquovery clumsily cobbled together with absolutely no regard or thought for its wider implication.Speaking ahead of the debate, Stormont Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots indicated he would not be supporting the bill. vw,vw,px, px\"Alliance Party MLA John Blair Mr Poots contended foxes are a threat to some ground-nesting birds such as red grouse and hen harriers.ldquoIf wersquore serious about bioersity, then we need to have management tools and we need to be very cautious about removing management tools, he told BBC Radio Ulster.ldquoIrsquom not sure it is a particularly well written bill so I canrsquot support it on that basis. Personally I donrsquot hunt, I donrsquot particularly like hunting but I canrsquot support this particular bill because I think that it isnrsquot well thought through. It might be well meaning but not well thought through and has damaging consequencesit came into force.Hunting with dogs has been banned in England, Scotland, and Wales since the early s.The bill will be open for debate on the floor of the Assembly on Monday after gaining signicant support during a public consultation with nearly % of the , respondents in favour of a ban.It is understood to be the largest consultation response in Stormontrsquos history.The bill has been backed by the Northern Ireland animal welfare charity, the USPCA.Mr Blair said: ldquoNorthern Ireland is the only part of the United Kingdom without a ban on hunting with dogs, despite widespread public support to ban the practice.ldquoIt is my intention in bringing forward my Private Memberrsquos Bill, to reform legislation on hunting wild mammals with dogs in Northern Ireland, and bring our legislation in line with that in England, Scotland and Wales where the practice has been illegal for close to  years..remove vw,vw,px, px\"USPCA chief executive Brendan Mullan Chief executive Brendan Mullan said the charity has been ldquogreatly encouraged by the momentum around this bill.ldquoThe appetite of the public to end this cruel practice which causes unthinkable pain and suffering for innocent wild animals, he said.ldquoIt must be recognised that, now, with the bill being presented to the Assembly, we are coming to a pivotal juncture for animal welfare here in Northern Ireland, which will set the tone for our future.ldquoThere is a real opportunity here for the Assembly to put on record their commitment to enhancing animal welfare standards, and specically on this occasion, introducing legislation which has been in place in other regions for nearly  years.ldquoThe arguments against banning hunting wild mammals with dogs are based on tradition and pest control however it is categorically clear that the cruelty involved in this activity far outweighs any supposed benefit.ldquoMoreover, the rationalisation regarding pest control is tenuous at best as there is no evidence of this being the case.ldquoIn England for example, the ban has been in place for quite some time and an inquiry taken forward at Westminster has stated that the contribution of fox hunting is almost insignicant in terms of managing the fox population as a whole.Mr Mullan added: ldquoThis issue has been a key focus of the USPCA for a number of years, with our goal for the introduction of a ban outlined in our Animal Welfare Manesto lsquoAddressing the Deficitrsquo.ldquoMembers of the public have made their views on this barbaric lsquosportrsquo very clear, and we look forward to the Assemblyrsquos response which we hope will consign it to the pages of history for Northern Ireland. Killing defenceless wild mammals with dogs is sadistic and cruel and has no place in a compassionate society.But Gary McCartney, director of Countryside Alliance Ireland, which opposes the bill, contended that it could ldquopotentially criminalise every dog owner in Northern Ireland and ldquoalso represents an attack on the rural way of le.ldquoAnyone whose dog chases a rabbit or squirrel, for example, whilst they are simply out for a walk in the park, partaking in country pursuits, checking their livestock or engaged in any other activity will be committing a criminal offence, he said.ldquoWe are continuing to urge MLAs to oppose this bill..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Stormont Assembly to debate ban on hunting with dogs in Northern Ireland article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communitySome  cases of Omicron ndash also known as B... ndash were confirmed in the UK as of Sunday.But what do we know about the new strain so far, and what could it mean for future restrictions ndash How would you knowyou have contracted the Omicron strain People with Covid- symptoms should take a PCR test, and scientists can determine which strain they have contractedit is positive.This requires genetic analysis in a laboratory and can take up to  days. vw,vw,px, px\"Positive PCR tests can be analysed by scientists in a laboratory to determine which iant a person has contracted Not all UK labs are equipped with the technology needed to identy Omicron cases, which means some parts of the country will be able to track the sp easily than others.Rapid or lateral flow tests cannot tell you which iant you have been infected with, but scientists believe they will still reflect a positive resultyou have the Omicron iant.ndash When did Omicron first appear UK scientists became aware of the new strain on November , after samples were uploaded to a coronavirus iant tracking website from South Africa, Hong Kong and then Botswana.The World Health Organisationdesignated it a ldquoiant of concern on November , because it has several mutations which mean it is more dficult to predict how it will behave.ndash How is Omicron dferent to other iants The latest iant involves mutations on the spike protein of the virus, which is the part targeted by most vaccines. vw,vw,px, px\"According to the Office for National Statistics , scientists dferentiate Omicron from other iants by identying patterns among three genes in positive results ndash the S gene, the ORFab gene and the N gene.Delta iant infections usually test positive for all three genes, whereas the Omicron iant is known to test negative for the S gene..removendash Is Omicron more deadly or transmissible than previous iants It is unclear whether Omicron is more transmissible compared with other iants, including the dominant Delta strain, according to the WHO.The number of people testing positive for coronavirus has risen in areas of South Africa affected by the iant, and studies have begun to determine whether this is because it is more easily passed on.It is also unclear whether Omicron is likely to cause more deaths or severe disease, and understanding this is likely to take several more weeks, the WHO has said.ndash What are the symptoms of Omicron The WHO has said there is no evidence that symptoms associated with Omicron are dferent to those of other iants. vw,vw,px, px\"There have been  Omicron cases identied in the UK so far Initial reported infections in South Africa were among university students who had a mild disease ndash but this is common among the younger age group for all iants.The most common Covid- symptoms are still a cough, fever and a loss of smell or taste.ndash How many cases have been confirmed in the UK The UK Health Security Agency said a further  cases of Omicron had been confirmed in the UK on Sunday,  in England and  in Scotland, bringing the total to .Professor Mark Woolhouse, who is a member of the Scientic Pandemic Influenza Group on Modellingwhich advises the Government, has said Omicron is ldquospreading pretty rapidly and the figure will rise.ndash What are the concerns about Omicron and when will we knowthey are well-founded There are concerns around transmissibility, severity of illness and vaccine efficacy.Deputy chief medical officer for England Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said scientists around the world agree that the Omicron iant is ldquoof increased concern. vw,vw,px, px\"Professor Jonathan Van Tam has warnedthat Omicron could be more transmissible than previous iants He said there are still uncertainties about how transmissible the iant is and its impact on severity of disease.He said the ldquonumber of mutations present, already on first principle, makes us worry about a possible effect on vaccine effectiveness.He made clear that there ldquoare far more things we donrsquot know yet, than things we do know about the iant, but that he expects more to become clear in two weeks.ndash What is happening in the UK as scientists work to find out more about Omicron The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationis now advising that all adults aged  to  should be offered a Covid- booster dose, in order of descending age groups, to increase their level of protection.Early evidence suggests that higher antibody levels may give better protection against the iant.Booster doses should be given no sooner than three months after people have had their second dose of an original vaccine ndash shaving three months off the current six-month wait.Meanwhile, young people aged  to  should be offered a second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid- vaccine, no sooner than  weeks after their first dose.ndash Have any new measures been introduced in the UK The Government has tightened rules around PCR tests for travellers ing to the UK and introduced quarantine rules for people from high-risk countries, as well as bringing back face coverings in shops and on public transport in England.It has also accelerated the Covid booster programme to help slow down the spread of the new iant. vw,vw,px, px\"Face coverings are once again compulsory inside shops in England Scotlandrsquos First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and Walesrsquos First Minister, Mark Drakeford, have demanded that a tougher four-nations approach is adopted.Downing Street rejected calls from Ms Sturgeon and Mr Drakeford for the self-isolation period for travellers to be extended until the result of a test on day eight after arriving in the UK.Extending the requirements would have a ldquodetrimental effect on the travel industry, No  said.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all implemented travel rules for non-red list arrivals.ndash What do tightened rules mean for Christmas parties Although there are no official bans on large gatherings, scientists have urged people to act cautiously.Professor Robert West, a member of the Scientic Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours , encouraged revellers to make ldquoflexible plans for the holiday period. vw,vw,px, px\"Despite tightened restrictions in England, there are no bans on gatherings for Christmas parties He told Sky News last week he personally would not make plans ldquothat involve gatherings that canrsquot be changed.Prof West said: ldquoIn other words, keep flexible. Make your plans, by all means, as I am, but do it in a way which means that should the worst come to the worst, and we have to make sure that people stay apart from each other as much as possible as is safe, then you can still enjoy the holiday period.ndash What about working from home England is the only UK nation where working from home is not encouraged.Ms Sturgeon reminded people in Scotland on Monday to ldquowork from homepossible.The advice is the same in Northern Ireland, and working from home is encouraged under current guidance in Wales.Previously the Prime Ministerrsquos spokesman has said it was up to employers to decide on the ldquoright balance for them, when it came to whether staff worked from home or the office.Jurisdiction over coronavirus restrictions is devolved, meaning Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos policies apply to England, and may dfer from the rules where in the UK..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Omicron: What do we know about the new Covid- iant  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon will benefit from greenway works in Dromore and secure cycle parking, bike repair stands and cycle counters.Mrs Kelly said: “The announcement of an additional £m funding from SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon will benefit projects and people locally and across the North. Since becoming a minister, Nichola Mallon has made greenway and active travel projects a key priority for her and it’s great to see this delivery building on the success of other projects in this area. “In Upper Bann, cycle parking facilities and its usage have been generally very low but a large proportion are located on private land for customer use. However, the potential cycle parking solutions considered by Council offers a higher level of cycle parking given the visibility and security of the locations, followed by off street car parks, parks and then within the existing footways of the town centre. “The fact that SDLP Minister Mallon received more applications for funding than anticipated demonstrates the popularity of these projects and schemes across the North.“ The coronavirus pandemic highlighted the importance of having local greenways and outdoor spaces that people can enjoy and this funding commitment from the Minister will improve the lives of communities across the North. “The SDLP is determined to deliver the projects that matter to local people and I’m delighted to see SDLP Minister Mallon continue in this vein.” New hospital for Craigavon in limbo as Departments of Health and Finance wrangle over costEditor’s Message:Thank you for reading this article.
