Hong Kong’s leaders are closely following Beijing’s closed-border zero-Covid strategy and say normalising travel with China must come before the rest of the world. “Things are horrible, resignations are through the roof,” one pilot, who has more than 20 years’ flying experience and has applied to two rival airlines, told AFP. “There are a lot of guys at their breaking point. It’s actually amazing that we haven’t had an accident yet.” For much of the pandemic Hong Kong has restricted inbound travel with as much as three weeks mandatory quarantine. Resentment built throughout the pandemic but exploded last month when more than 270 people - made up of some 120 crew plus their families - were ordered into a government quarantine camp after three pilots tested positive on return from Germany. The trio were later fired when Cathay said they had left their hotel rooms during their layover. In a recording obtained by AFP, Cathay’s director of flight operations Chris Kempis told employees this week that there was “a higher resignation rate among pilots right now”. In a statement, Cathay Pacific said it had to abide by Hong Kong’s regulations. State premier Mark McGowan unveiled the $185m transition plan to reopen WA to the world at a state address on Wednesday.

The state has taken a hard-line stance to border control during the pandemic with the emergence of the Omicron variant prompting the federal government to reintroduce quarantine for some international travellers.

Another 477 deaths were also recorded, bringing the total death toll to 469,724. ’s science correspondent Nicola Davis tells Hannah Moore the variant is so new to scientists there is not enough data to predict how serious a threat it could pose, but the next two weeks will be crucial. Listen to our latest podcast episode below. Public confusion and distrust over vaccination have been fuelled by what experts say are crippling failures in authorities’ response to the pandemic in the Pacific island nation.  Other countries in the Pacific are also significantly lagging behind in vaccination rates with experts predicting a handful of nations will have less than a quarter of adults vaccinated by the end of the year. The European nation reported another 73,209 new Covid cases for Wednesday and 388 deaths, according to data from the Robert Koch Institute. The figures bring the total confirmed cumulative coronavirus cases in the nation to 5,977,208 with 102,178 deaths. The country’s transport ministry has cancelled its blanket ban on accepting new reservations for inbound flights and asked airlines to accommodate the needs of returning Japanese, Reuters reports.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno added that Prime Minister Fumio Kishida had asked the transport ministry to be mindful of returning Japanese given the confusion a suspension of new bookings installed on Wednesday had caused. The plaintiffs in the proposed class action filed in Manhattan federal court accused Bristol Myers of violating a federal civil rights law known as Title VII by “systematically manufacturing” reasons to refuse religious accommodations. The plaintiffs - reported by Reuters to be Carrie Kefalas, a physician overseeing clinical trial risk management for drug development biotechnologist John Lott data integrity manager Jeremy Beer, and biologist Kamila Dubisz - allege that Bristol Myers is concluding their politics is the real reason they won’t be vaccinated, regardless of whether they have sincere religious beliefs that independently would justify exemptions. They objected to the company requiring they fill out “inquisitorial” questionnaires about their reasons for religious exemptions. Bristol Myers said its priority during the pandemic has been the health and safety of communities, employees and patients. “Our policy that all eligible employees in (the) US and Puerto Rico be vaccinated against Covid-19 is consistent with this safety priority,” the New York-based company said in a statement to Reuters. The complaint said Bristol Myers rejected Kefalas’ request because it thought her beliefs were insincere and she might not accept mask-wearing or regular Covid-19 testing. The company offered no reasons for the other rejections, the complaint said. Bristol Myers referred in Kefalas’ rejection letter to several statements it said she made publicly, including that its vaccine requirement was a “communist, unamerican practice.” The lawsuit seeks a permanent injunction against Bristol Myers’ firing the plaintiffs or similarly situated employees.Researchers from the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) - an association of radiologists, radiation oncologists, medical physicists and related scientists - reported the findings on Tuesday. “Much has been written about the overall pulmonary problems related to Covid-19, but we do not often talk about the other organs that can be affected,” said study lead author Scott H. Faro, M.D., FASFNR, professor of radiology and neurology and director of the Division of NeuroradiologyHead \u0026amp Neck Imaging at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, said.  The most common finding was stroke due to clogged arteries, but the researchers also saw bleeding in the brain, inflammation of the brain, and other potentially fatal complications. This is a decrease from the 113 reported Covid cases a day earlier, its health authority said. Of the new infections, 53 were locally transmitted, according to a statement by the National Health Commission, compared with 91 a day earlier. All of the new locally transmitted cases were in Inner Mongolia. There were no new deaths, leaving the death toll at 4,636. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) reported 5,266 cases for Wednesday, a day after the daily tally rose above 5,000 for the first time. Authorities will require a 10-day quarantine for all inbound travellers for two weeks starting Friday, halting exemptions given earlier to fully vaccinated people, the KDCA said. The measure came after South Korea confirmed its first five cases of the Omicron variant late on Wednesday, including a fully vaccinated couple who arrived last week from Nigeria, followed by two of their family members and a friend. Total infections rose to 457,612, with 3,705 deaths.  Restrictions are set to ease for some temporary visa holders in time for Christmas, including those on international skilled, student, humanitarian, working holiday and provisional family visas. This will allow them to leave and re-enter Australia without exemptions from 15 December. But for holders of other types of temporary visas there is still no end in sight. Read the full story here.

If we didn’t understand it, the disease is showing us. We haven’t coped with it. We all fell short of where China was at, which was to contain the first round,” Tooze told The  during a Zoom interview from New York.“We have now in the last nine months blown the chance to get ahead of the disease globally through massive vaccinations so we have chosen to live in this world that we’re living in. We have chosen to have this variant.”The British historian was speaking ahead of his appearance at a virtual event in Dublin today on the subject: “The challenging of mobilising Ireland in a post-Covid era”, where he will join a panel discussion with Department of Health secretary general Robert Watt among others.Tooze sees the Covid-19 pandemic as the first economic crisis of the “Anthropocene era” – the current period of Earth’s geological history when humankind’s impact on nature is impacting on the world’s population in unpredictable and sometimes disastrous ways.In his view, the “great acceleration” – when this impact has quickly intensified and become global in nature – requires a radical rethink of world views and how the world responds to manage multiple crises, beyond improvisation and short-term measures used to deal with earlier crises. Tooze believes leaders are managing these crises in a “new era of ad hockery” when there needs to be more extensive, collective action: a massive global response to a huge global crisis.Billy Glennon, chief executive of Vision Consulting, who has organised today’s event, said the big question Tooze poses – how to prepare ourselves for action in a world where the challenges are different? – points to the need to move beyond the leftright “socialist versus capitalist” debate and to bring public and private organisations together to come up with better responses.“The models and rules of thumb and policies and structures of the past, which have worked well, are not going to be enough,” he said.‘Disaster avoidance’Meanwhile, Tooze says the pandemic has turned “vast disaster avoidance” into a “multi-trillion dollar business” and that requires similar investment to put people in a position to be able to respond.“We should have the top virologists around the world sit down and say what are the six worst-case variants we could have? And then let’s assign squads of people and multiple-fund squads of people to pre-envision that possibility,” he said.“If we don’t end up getting payoff from this particular coronavirus, and its mutations, we know from the SARS experience, we will get it from some other one which comes along predictably in the next 10 to 20 years.”Beyond the clear public health benefits from doubling or tripling science budgets in a bid to end the pandemic, governments should see this as “incredible investment opportunities” and creating high-quality jobs that this generation hopes for our children and children’s children.“It is exactly the sort of thing that an economy like Ireland ought to be developing a niche capacity for in various ways,” he said.“One of the secrets to Ireland’s economic success is highly skilled labour and this is will be precisely the kind of line where you would expect to be able to build capacity, maybe not for this coronavirus, but maybe for some other version of this.”While this investment will require redundancy and a degree of subsidy, taxpayers should “quite happily” pay this as “some sort of insurance premium” to give us a chance to respond.“Otherwise, basically, all our plans for 2022 and 2023 are now in jeopardy,” he said.To tackle global vaccine inequality, Tooze says richer countries, including Ireland, should “twin” with poorer countries, such as in Africa, to drive vaccinations there. Irish leaders, in politics, science and economics, should “gain leverage” to make a difference in multi-lateral bodies such as the European Union and Covax, the international vaccination agency.He says governments have failed to recognise and act on what is in their self-interest.Vaccinating high-risk parts of the world “where the pandemic is running wild” should be part of the same calculation for the Irish Government as vaccinating high– and low-risk people in Ireland.“This is a conflict of interest. It is not, however, a question of whether or not you protect your own. The question is how you best protect your own,” said Tooze.“The failure of political and governmental imagination is not to recognise that by protecting people in Africa you are protecting your own.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"lack of prompt covid decision making exhausting public s patience","story":"People queuing at Citywest vaccination centre in Dublin this week.

Photograph: iStockIreland’s first confirmed case of the Omicron variant was identified through “blind luck”, according to public health officials.The case involved a person who recently returned from a country in southern Africa, where the new variant was first identified. Seven designated countries in the region are now the subject of travel restrictions.The person had returned to Ireland before the restrictions were imposed and then developed symptoms which necessitated a PCR test in the past week.Outlining the case at a media briefing on Wednesday, Dr Cillian de Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, said he had no details on the severity of the case.Dr de Gascun said there was “an element of blind luck” involved in the identification of the case, as it was included in a regular 10 per cent sample of all cases that is referred to the NVRL’s lab at Backweston each week.He said a review of cases involving S-gene failure, which can be used to identify potential Omicron cases, was carried out, dating back to the start of October.This identified 14 recent samples with this characteristic, of which eight could be retrieved. These were sent for whole genome sequencing, but only one was confirmed as involving Omicron. Enhanced contact tracing around the case has since begun.Seven other cases with S-gene dropout, which can be indicative of Omicron, were found not to involve this variant but a sub-lineage of the dominant Delta variant.According to Dr de Gascun, the prevalence of S-gene dropout cases was well under 1 per cent. The vast majority of cases from October and November were no longer be available for sequencing.Dr de Gascun said there was no evidence of community transmission of the variant in Ireland, and for this reason travel measures had been introduced to minimise spread. Once a variant gets into a country, it has to achieve a “critical mass”, after which dominance occurs over four to eight weeks.About 1,500 cases a week can be genetically sequenced, or about 5 per cent of all cases, he told the briefing.The NVRL had anticipated the S-gene dropout test could have been used as a proxy test for the presence of Omicron, prior to sequencing, but Dr de Gascun said the fact that only one out of eight samples identified in this way turned out to be the new variant showed it could not be used in isolation as a surveillance measure.Officials are now working through what the best approach might be. Aside from travel-related cases and close contacts, they will be trying to find the best way of sampling that can “characterise what’s happening in the population at large”.“We only found out about this lack of association between S-gene targeting and Omicron this morning.”Omicron responseThe emergence last week of the new variant prompted the Government on Friday to impose travel restrictions on passengers from seven southern African countries: South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini and Mozambique. People arriving in Ireland from these countries have to quarantine at home for 10 days after entering the State. Although the number of travellers impacted will be small, the reintroduction of travel restrictions marks a further return to tighter restrictions to bring Covid under control.Travellers from those countries will also have to present a “not-detected” pre-flight PCR test result, regardless of vaccination status, quarantine at home for 10 days and undergo a further two PCR tests. The obligation is backdated for recent arrivals from these countries, who will be traced and contacted using the passenger locator form. The Garda will monitor compliance, initially.Concerns over Omicron and the ongoing high level of Covid cases in the State has led to the Government approving a raft of measures.These measures require travellers into Ireland from any country to show negative PCR or antigen test results, introduce mask-wearing for primary school children from third class upwards and ask parents to limit their children’s socialising.Pandemic powersTwo pieces of legislation – one to extend several Covid powers and one specifically to revive mandatory hotel quarantine if needed – are to be brought to the Dáil and Seanad in the coming days.The mandatory hotel legislation is necessary because those powers have already lapsed, while the other Covid powers – including those concerning masks, hospitality restrictions, Covid certificates, travel restrictions and others – are due to lapse early next year.Officials are currently preparing orders to require travellers into the country to show a negative PCR or antigen test from Friday. There will be “spot checks” at the airport to ensure travellers are compliant, but officials said it would be mostly a matter for airlines and ferry companies to ensure that passengers could show a negative test.The Government is considering fines for carriers that allow people without tests to board, while a spokesman confirmed there would be fines for passengers who could not show a negative test. There will be no checks for travellers from Northern Ireland.

Photograph: Nick BradshawTánaiste Leo Varadkar has told a meeting of the Fine Gael parliamentary party that he is not convinced new Covid-19 restrictions are needed, ahead of a meeting of the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) on Thursday. Mr Varadkar is understood to have told the group that recent data on the disease suggests Ireland is tracking the more optimistic side of modelling projections drawn up last month, and he is skeptical that new restrictions are necessary. He said the situation was “stable or improving slightly” and we are doing “substantially better” than Nphet’s optimistic models and projections in terms of casaes, numbers in hospital, ICU and deaths.He said he was “sceptical that imposing new restrictions on people’s freedoms, family life and businesesses would be warranted at this time”. Against that, he said there was a concern that the stabalisation had come at a very high level. If things went wrong at Christmas, they would do so from a very high base, and that there was a “genuine cause for concern” with people socialising more at Christmas and that the Government would listen carefully to Nphet’s advice on Thursday before making any decisions. The meeting also heard contributions from multiple members on the cuts which have come into force on the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), calling on Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe to consider the restoration of the original rate in the scheme.The meeting heard strong contributions from several TDs and Senators on the issue, including Limerick City TD Kieran O’Donnell and Senator Garrett Aherne. The hospitality sector is seeing a raft of cancellations due to people observing public health advice, as are play centres, which were raised by Carlow-Kilkenny TD John Paul Phelan. Minister of State Martin Heydon told the meeting that the support that has been provided for business through the EWSS has been critical to maintaining the link between employers and employees, and that it was “crucial” that sectors such as hospitality whose turnover has “fallen off a cliff” continue to be supported. Mr Ahearne said he had been inundated with submissions from employers who are worried about the months ahead, telling the meeting that “we cannot have supported them up to now and then let them fall at the last hurdle”. ReassuranceMr Donohoe indicated that he would be giving the broad matter consideration but did not give any commitment on reversing the cut, and that the matter is going through the Dáil at the moment – and also that he would wait to see what arose from Nphet’s meeting tomorrow.He pointed out the scheme was introduced at a time of mass unemployment which is not being faced now, and that it is expensive – costing €400 million in November alone. He said that all the sectors on the scheme are not impacted by public health restrictions, for example construction.The meeting also heard contributions from Clare TD Joe Carey and Donegal TD Joe McHugh on the mica issue, after the Government unveiled a €2.2 billion plan to remediate mica-affected homes, many of which are located in their constituencies.Mr McHugh is understood to have told the meeting that he appreciated the solidarity he had experienced from his colleagues in Fine Gael, but that there were problems with the sliding scale. He said it was important to give people “some reassurance before Christmas” on the issue. Mr Carey similarly said there were issues with the sliding scale part of the scheme.The meeting was chaired by Jennifer Carroll MacNeill, TD for Dun Laoighaire, who became the first woman to do so. The party also supported a motion welcoming and encoruaging alternative gas supply options for the State which are not from fracked sources.

Photograph: Joe DunneAll politicians must be dissemblers to a greater or lesser degree, but the Taoiseach is useless at disguising when he is annoyed in the Dáil chamber. And on Wednesday he couldn’t help himself snapping at Opposition TDs seeking to score points off him on the two issues that have dominated politics this week – Covid and mica. His Government now finds itself under fierce pressure on both fronts.During Leaders’ Questions, phones pinged in the chamber with the news from the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) media briefing – relayed to the Taoiseach by Labour leader Alan Kelly – that Ireland’s first case of the new Omicron variant had been confirmed. It will not be the last.There is not yet any scientific consensus of the threat posed by the new variant - the most common phrase used by people in and around Government is “we just don’t know yet”. On the one hand, there are fears that it may be less amenable to vaccine protection than its predecessors on the other, the experience in South Africa tends to suggest that, so far, it may be less serious. We’ll see.OptimismThe threat from the new variant emerged just as Ministers and officials were beginning to permit themselves some optimism about the trajectory of the fourth wave. Cases have stabilised – albeit at a high level – and while hospitals remain under extreme pressure, they haven’t been overwhelmed. But the emergence of the variant has changed the mood.The Department of Health’s own research shows the extent to which the country has been punched in the stomach. Levels of stress, frustration and anxiety have shot up, by some measures back to where they were in the spring when society was still mostly locked down.In September, just 10 per cent of people thought the worst of the pandemic was ahead of us two-thirds of people (66 per cent) believed the worst was over. Now just 29 per cent of people believe the worst is over, and 24 per cent think the worst is still ahead of us. Privately, politicians wonder how much more people can take. The pressure in Government is pretty intense. Right now they are afraid of being advised to impose more stringent restrictions that they don’t think will be observed – and then of being blamed when they don’t work. That is not an unrealistic scenario.RetreatOn mica, the Government finds itself in retreat a day after it unveiled its long-awaited plan to fix the thousands of homes in Donegal and beyond that are falling apart because of defective building material. Both the Taoiseach and Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien were suggesting that the details of the scheme may now be changed in order to provide the affected householders with more cash. The opposition, led by Sinn Féin, and the campaigners, smell blood in the water.The Government was faced with two choices, each with pros and cons. It could have undertaken to pay for everything. Or it could have made the case that the State is not – and shouldn’t be – legally liable for the costs of reinstating every brick and every square foot of the affected properties. It could have said that it will help, and will pay for most or nearly all the costs, but that it wouldn’t write a blank cheque for the restitution of large houses paid for with the taxes of people who rent smaller houses and apartments because they can’t afford to buy their own.Both approaches have benefits, and both have drawbacks. But by announcing one approach while pretending it had the benefits of the other, though, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that this is another botched job."},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics the life and legacy of charles j haughey with professor gary murphy","story":"Depending on who you ask, Charles J.

Photograph:   Gareth ChaneyCollinsConstruction industry figures have said the State’s redress scheme for homes damaged by defective mica blocks will likely be “sufficient” to cover the cost of rebuilding the average sized home in the northwest.However, they also suggested the cost of replacing larger homes would not be fully covered under the indicative rates set out in the Government’s Defective Concrete Block Scheme.The sliding scale would cover rebuilding costs at €145 per sq ft for the first 1,000sq ft of a home, then at €110 for the next 1,000 sq ft, and €100 per sq ft after that.The Mica Action Group has called for the sliding scale to be scrapped in favour of a flat rate of €145 per sq ft.It warned of renewed protest and claimed these rates would see homeowners having to contribute around €65,000 of their own funds to rebuild a standard sized home in Donegal of about 2,400 sq ft.The Government has disputed suggestions that owners of homes of around 2,500 sq ft would have to contribute their own funds under the scheme which now has an increased cap of €420,000.Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien said an independent review of the scheme’s rates would be carried out by Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI) in February.He told Highland Radio in Donegal this will take construction inflation into account and indicated the vast majority of homeowners will not have to contribute any of their own funds.He also defended the tapering of the rates.‘Not going to do it’Barry Kearney, a quantity surveyor in Letterkenny, said the redress scheme “will probably be sufficient” to rebuild homes of less than 2,500 sq ft.For larger homes the sq ft rates in the scheme were “not going to do it” and could leave homeowners footing bills of up to €30,000 to €50,000.One Dublin property developer felt the scheme’s rates could “absolutely” cover most of a home’s rebuild costs.In contrast, Bert Galbraith, owner of Donegal-based Galbraith Construction, said the redress scheme was “nearly there” but had fallen slightly short.He said rough building quotes for a house were running at €150 per sq ft at present, which is above the highest rate on the mica redress scale."},{"url":null,"title":"minister under pressure to drop mica redress sliding scale","story":"Mica protest: Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien defended the mica redress plan, saying the rates were ‘indicative’.Photograph: Laura HuttonMinister for Housing Darragh O’Brien is under pressure from homeowners in the northwest to drop proposals to finance on a sliding scale the rebuilding of mica-damaged homes. The Mica Action Group has warned of renewed protests in Dublin if the sliding scale is not dropped before Christmas.Sinn Féin has called for it to be removed immediately and Government backbenchers have also voiced concerns.Under the plans announced on Tuesday the cap on the sum a homeowner can get from the Defective Concrete Block Scheme was raised to €420,000.A sliding scale of financial supports would cover rebuilding costs at €145 per square foot for the first 1,000sq ft of a home, €110 for the next 1,000sq ft, and €100 per square foot after that.The Mica Action Group has called for a flat rate of €145 per square foot, claiming the rates in the plan would see homeowners having to contribute about €65,000 of their own funds to rebuild.‘Indicative’ ratesMinister for Housing Darragh O’Brien defended the plan, saying the rates were “indicative” and an independent review of them would be carried out by Chartered Surveyors of Ireland in February.In the Dáil, Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty said the scheme was not “100 per cent redress” and was “nowhere near it”.Taoiseach Micheál Martin accused Mr Doherty of “feigned outrage” and insisted the scheme would deal “comprehensively” with issues raised by residents.Clare Fine Gael TD Joe Carey raised “significant concern” about the sliding scale among homeowners in his county, where those with defective blocks in their properties hope to be included in the scheme. One person told him they would have to contribute €67,000 to remediation costs for a 2,500sq ft home.Mr Martin said figures are “being plucked out of air” and his understanding was €300,000 would be on offer to rebuild a home of that size, along with €20,000 for rent and storage costs. Donegal Fine Gael TD Joe McHugh earlier claimed on RTÉ radio the sliding scale “makes absolutely no sense”.When pressed on Wednesday, Mr McHugh, who last month said he would consider leaving Fine Gael if the scheme did not meet homeowners’ expectations, did not offer a clear answer on whether he would leave the party. He said if homeowners were excluded by the need to contribute money themselves “I’ll not be standing over this scheme”."},{"url":null,"title":"new restrictions being considered to control covid 19 over christmas","story":"Pupils in third class at St Etchen’s National School in Kinnegad, Co Westmeath, on the first day the wearing of face masks in primary schools became mandatory. Photograph: Damien EagersPublic health officials will\u0026nbspconsider new restrictions on Thursday as part of an effort to keep Covid-19 under control over the Christmas period.Several officials said they expect the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) will discuss whether to recommend curbs at its meeting on Thursday, given ongoing high levels of infection and the still-unknown impact of the Omicron variant.It is not expected that harsh lockdown-style measures will form a part of discussions, however, with emphasis instead on curbing socialising and reducing crowding in hospitality settings.Such an approach could see capacity limits for indoor hospitality settings advised, restrictions on booking sizes and reduced opening hours, or enhanced use of the Covid cert. Advice on household visits is also likely to be considered.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar told his Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting he was “sceptical” that imposing new restrictions was necessary, as the disease was tracking optimistic projections.He pointed out, however, that coronavirus cases remained at a high level and more people would be socialising around Christmas. Mr Varadkar told Nphet on Monday it should develop a contingent set of additional curbs to be deployed if the situation worsened, rather than enforcing new rules now, it is understood.Taoiseach Micheál Martin told his Fianna Fáil party that a combination of “vigilance, reduced socialisation and an accelerated booster campaign” was needed.There are concerns in political circles that harsher restrictions could be recommended by Nphet after last week’s unanticipated measures targeting children’s activities.First caseIt comes as the State confirmed its first case of the Omicron variant, with the US also recording its first incidence.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said Nphet would be meeting on Thursday to consider whether further restrictions were necessary, “mindful of Delta and the uncertainty around the Omicron variant”.“If we could see extensive use of the vaccine pass, whether mandated or voluntary, all of that would give us greater assurance in relation to protection and prevention of transmission,” he said.Nothing should be “inferred” at this stage about further recommendations from Nphet, Dr Holohan added.While cases have slowed and are stable they are at a very high number, Dr Holohan said, and this leaves the country exposed to the results of a potential increase in socialisation around Christmas, as well as the uncertainty around Omicron.Officials are expected to discuss plans to track the spread of the new variant, which are likely to be hampered by a lack of genome sequencing capacity.The National Virus Reference Laboratory had hoped to rely on information from PCR testing to identify Omicron cases. However, its director Dr Cillian de Gascun acknowledged there is a “lack of association” between the information provided by the test and Omicron cases.Only one of the first eight samples identified through PCR testing as potential Omicron cases actually turned out to involve the new variant. Current capacity only allows for 5 per cent of cases to be sequenced.There were backbench calls at both the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael parliamentary party meetings for the restoration of the full rates of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which were cut this week, though no commitment on this was offered by senior Coalition figures.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"why bulgaria has the lowest vaccination rate in the eu","story":"Medical staff push a trolley bed carrying the body of a deceased Covid-19   patient in   the intensive care unit of Lozenets hospital in Sofia, Bulgaria: just 27 per cent of the country’s total population has been fully vaccinated.  Photograph: Nikolay DoychinovAFPBulgaria has the lowest vaccination rate in the European Union: just 27 per cent of its total population has been fully vaccinated, according to figures collected by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.It also has the EU’s highest Covid-19 death rate, with 327 deaths per million people over a fortnight. To put it in perspective, it suggests that if Croke Park had been packed to capacity with Bulgarians for an event two weeks ago, 27 of them would have died of Covid-19 since.That’s 20 times Ireland’s death rate. The data from across Europe clearly show that the higher the vaccination rate in a country, the lower its rate of deaths. So why has such a large majority of people in Bulgaria declined to take a vaccine, despite the jabs being available?The story began last year. Back then, each EU country was offered vaccines from AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Moderna, under the EU joint purchase scheme. Bulgaria’s government under-ordered Pfizer and Moderna, betting the house on AstraZeneca, which was cheaper and easier to store.“We didn’t manage to ersify the risk,” says Petar Vitanov, an MEP with the Bulgarian Socialist Party. “We ordered 75 per cent from AstraZeneca only.”It was a poor wager. Bulgaria was hit hard by early supply problems as the company failed to deliver the promised quantities of vaccines. On top of this, data from the vaccine trials was messy, and initial trials did not involve many older people. This led cautious governments to recommend the vaccine only for younger groups at first, pending more data.Side effectsThis is why reports of side effects emerged early in the EU: this particular vaccine was initially predominantly given to health workers, who are working-age and majority female. While extremely rare, its side effects seem to occur more frequently in younger women. Confusingly, it meant governments then switched, restricting AstraZeneca to older groups instead.The European Medicines Agency never wavered that the benefits of AstraZeneca outweigh the risks for adults. But to Bulgarians, it seemed like negative news about this vaccine just didn’t stop.Meanwhile, national politics was in a state of chaos. Prime minister Boyko Borissov was forced to resign following weeks of street protests over alleged corruption and abuse of power. Political deadlock prevented parties from forming a new coalition: the country held three elections in eight months.Amid the tumult, public opinion of the authorities reached a low. There wasn’t enough stability to enforce strong health measures, and public communication about the vaccines was shoddy.“We were in constant elections,” Vitanov recalls. “There were some concerns about adopting certain measures, in order not to lose popularity.”Into the vacuum, bad actors moved. Conspiracy theories, disinformation and rumour abounded on social media. And for some, the fear and uncertainty of the pandemic provided an opportunity.Anti-vaxxer movement“Fake news was a huge, huge problem in Bulgaria,” Vitanov says. “In social media, the anti-vaxxer movement is really flourishing here.” A far-right party used an anti-vaccination platform to get into parliament for the first time.Vitanov rejects the commonly-aired theories that there is an older cultural or historical reason for scepticism, such as the legacy of communism resulting in distrust of authorities. He points out that Bulgaria has traditionally had high vaccination rates: measles vaccine coverage in 2019 stood at a respectable 93 per cent, rivalling or surpassing the rates of older democracies.The country has had measles break-outs, a sign of insufficient vaccine coverage for a disease that can be particularly deadly to babies and toddlers. But these have tended to be in marginalised Roma communities, rather than in the broader Bulgarian population.Survey data does indicate that vaccine scepticism had begun to take root prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. It has inroads among the highly educated – including doctors – and younger groups, suggesting that this may be more like the “lifestyle choice” avoidance of vaccines that has been growing in wealthy countries over the last two decades.In October, Bulgaria introduced the Covid-19 digital certificate system to access services like bars and restaurants. It was controversial, but daily vaccinations rose by a factor of 10 as a result, Vitanov says. This informs his view that the incoming government needs to take a “strong hands” approach.“I’m definitely in favour of mandatory, obligatory vaccination. Maybe not for all the population, but at least for some people that are higher risk, or some professions that are dealing with a lot of people,” he says.\u0026nbsp“It’s not very popular. I know that it can affect negatively on your public image.

The only unambiguous positive is that our community spirit is alive and well, with millions ready to volunteer for the general good. We are more trusting of political and medical authorities than most other societies, and in return the British state has remained ever so slightly more liberal towards us unfortunately, our second-rate machinery of government is still scandalously unprepared for modern-day pandemics, new variants or any kind of genuine crisis.The 1940s-style bureaucracy-cum-national religion that is the NHS cannot cope, ever, regardless of how much money it is given. We are hardly the nation of freedom-lovers libertarian romantics naively assumed us to be, mostly preferring perceived security to liberty. Too many of our compatriots like to snitch on neighbours, and are pathologically incapable of rational, full-picture, long-term cost-benefit analyses. Another sorry truth: our society doesn’t properly value the education and development of children.There are several upshots to this strange blancmange of attitudes. Our vaccination rates among those aged 12 and over – 88.6 per cent have had first doses, 80.6 per cent second and 31.7 per cent third – are higher than in many other countries. This has saved many lives, and there is little prospect of the horrors of compulsory jabs as in Austria and advocated by Germany and Ursula von der Leyen. Our lockdowns, while extreme, were fortunately not as severe as those in Australia, China or France. But our ideological obsession with state delivery of healthcare and staggeringly low-grade civil service has cost many thousands of unnecessary deaths.We have also discovered something almost as damning over the past two years: it can suit many people for the country to be in a state of emergency, which also explains the politico-bureaucratic-medical establishment’s somewhat over-enthusiastic support for restrictions that will do little, if anything, to slow omicron.To be clear: I despise idiotic internet conspiracy theories, and of course the Government would love the new variant to fizzle out quickly. The pandemic has been a nightmare: it almost cost the Prime Minister his own life, has directly killed some 145,000 in the UK (before indirect effects and lockdown are accounted for) and has derailed the Tory agenda and economy. Many in Whitehall will once again be suffering from sleepless nights.Yet it is also an uncomfortable truth that, for some, there is a silver lining to the events of the past few days: delivering press conferences and being seen to act boldly is easier than politics as usual. It is helpful for the Government not to be grilled as much about MPs’ second jobs, or the fact that thousands are still crossing the Channel. The return of a sense of crisis should make the public more indulgent towards the Government’s failings. Voters may look more kindly upon the cost of living crisis and the broken promises on national insurance. The SNP and Welsh governments will also benefit.It is not just for politicians that there is an upside from the omicron-induced shift in the national agenda. It suits big companies and incompetent managers who made the most of Covid to downgrade their customer service. They used to blame Brexit now they blame omicron. It is convenient for disruptive trade unions and lazy employees on the look-out for an excuse to work less. It will embolden some to seek a hugely extended festive period working from home, regardless of the needs of employers or the extra burden imposed on colleagues. It suits the public sector, and its determination to put the interests of producers above those of consumers. Shut schools and cancelled nativity plays are a hideous, immoral blow to children, but are grist to militant unions’ mill.The worst offender, as ever, is the NHS, whose overworked doctors and nurses keep being let down by an irredeemably flawed institution. Omicron gives it cover to fail to reinstate face-to-face GP appointments, even if that means more non-Covid deaths, and to ignore its enormous backlog. Cancelled Christmas parties and holidays will make its life easier: the NHS wants us to work for it, rather than for it to serve us.Public health zealots thrive when restrictions are imposed: they like telling people what to do. Ditto some radical environmentalists. No wonder it is always easier to impose restrictions than to scrap them: plenty of vested interest groups benefit from them.The Government wants to tackle the variant by accelerating boosters, implying a belief that the current vaccines will also prevent omicron deaths and hospitalisations. But why did it take a new variant to galvanise the health service into action? Why had it been content with giving 2.5 million third jabs a week, against 4 million at the height of its rollout? Why did it dismantle its infrastructure? The Government’s management by crisis and its decision to call in the army is an easy short-term tactic to patch over the NHS’s deficiencies, and camouflages the failure to force through real change.The new scare is also helping the NHS avoid difficult questions about anti-virals. The Americans believe Covid will shortly be fully defeated thanks to apparent wonder drugs such as Pfizer’s Paxlovid. But not only do we need to purchase more doses, delivery is key: the pills need to be taken as soon as Covid becomes visible in the patient. What is the NHS’s plan to test and prescribe en masse?To Johnson’s credit, he had managed to make us more Swedish (in Covid policy terms) prior to omicron. Starting with Freedom Day, he ushered in a new British model that was hugely more liberal than that pursued by most of the developed world. Thanks to vaccinations, we learnt to live with an elevated level of infections, especially among the young, and a tolerable flu-like death toll. We should have jabbed faster, but other than that the strategy was correct: we were treating the virus as if it were endemic.Omicron is a major setback, but if it turns out to be manageable with the current vaccines, Johnson must promptly reverse all the restrictions imposed last week. Living in a permanent state of emergency makes life easier for bureaucrats and zero-risk killjoys, but it soon leads to the ruin of a nation.More from NewsI met Donald Trump at 14 and flew with Prince Andrew, claims Ghislaine Maxwell\u0026#39s accuserGhislaine Maxwell trial latest: I wish I never received $5m from Epstein victims\u0026#39 fund, says accuserWorldwide health alert after cardiologist says he caught Covid variant during London conference tripSweeps in court for \u0026#39planting dead pigeons in customers\u0026#39 chimneys\u0026#39Two more rounds of boosters to come as Government orders ‘variant-proof’ Covid vaccinesCountess of Christmas: Sophie gets into the party spirit on charity visitMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"two rounds boosters come government orders variant proof covid","story":"Britain has bought enough vaccines for two more boosters per person, under a deal to provide 114 million more jabs that can be modified against new variants.Ministers said the deal with Moderna and Pfizer, covering two more years, would “futureproof” the country beyond this winter’s rollout.Health chiefs are scrambling to accelerate the current programme so all eligible adults can be offered a third jab by the end of January, in an attempt to protect people from the omicron variant.Nine more cases of the variant were identified in England on Wednesday, taking the total number of confirmed UK cases to 32. Work is under way to establish if there are links to travel to southern Africa, with health officials warning that more cases are “very likely”.On Wednesday, an Israeli cardiologist identified as one of the first people in the world to be infected with omicron said he believed he caught it while in London last month, attending a heart conference attended by more than 1,200 medics.The disclosure raised concerns that the variant arrived in this country earlier than was known, with fears it could have spread at the event at ExCeL London more than a week ago.On Wednesday, daily reported cases of coronavirus doubled in South Africa, rising to 8,561. The omicron variant has been found to account for three-quarters of virus genomes sequenced in the country since it was identified last month.Meanwhile Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, called on EU member states to consider making Covid vaccinations mandatory, while the World Health Organisation reported that the variant had so far been found in 23 countries.In this country, health officials are attempting to draw up plans to administer boosters to more than 25 million people aged 18 and over in two months. Ministers signalled that the plan could mean fewer GP appointments for other reasons, with family doctors told that there was “nothing more important” than the national rollout. The Health and Social Care Secretary said a new deal for 114 million doses of Moderna and Pfizer in 2022 and 2023 would help to protect the public “for years to come”.The deal includes 60 million additional doses of the Moderna vaccine and 54 million more PfizerBioNTech doses. Officials said the Government already had enough supply of both Moderna and PfizerBioNTech for the current booster programme. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were preferred to AstraZeneca because they are mRNA jabs that are thought to adapt better to variants.Officials said the new contracts, accelerated in the light of the new variant, include “access to modified vaccines” in case needed to combat omicron and future variants of concern. Sajid Javid said: “Thanks to the Vaccines Taskforce, we have an excellent track record of securing the vaccines the country needs to keep this virus at bay.“These new deals will futureproof the Great British vaccination effort – which has so far delivered more than 115 million first, second and booster jabs across the UK – and will ensure we can protect even more people in the years ahead.“This is a national mission and our best weapon to deal with this virus and its variants is to get jabs in arms – so when you are called forward, get the jab and get boosted.”On Thursday, the Prime Minister will convene a summit of scientists and leaders of the pharmaceutical industry, as part of efforts to tackle emerging variants and create “variant-proof” vaccines within 100 days. Boris Johnson said he was “bringing global industry leaders together to discuss our renewed efforts against Covid-19, while ensuring we are better equipped to tackle future healthcare challenges”.However, global health leaders have questioned the UK’s booster campaign.Dr Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organisation\u0027s health emergencies programme, said the focus should be on ensuring the global population receives a first dose. He told a press briefing: “Right now, there is no evidence that I\u0027m aware of that would suggest that boosting the entire population is going to necessarily provide any greater protection for otherwise healthy iniduals against hospitalisation or death.”In total, the Government has secured early access to 453.5 million vaccine doses through supply agreements with six separate vaccine developers. These include 70 million that are being donated to other countries and 67 million doses of vaccines that have yet to be regulated. NHS England is in the process of drawing up new guidance, setting out how the accelerated rollout of boosters in this country will work. On Wednesday, the NHS had yet to issue plans for an accelerated rollout of jabs, four days after the Prime Minister called for a rapid extension of boosters.The plans are expected to see a sharp increase in the number of hospitals offering jabs to the public. Currently, just 30 NHS hospitals in England offer boosters. But this number is expected to double in the next two weeks, while all 230 NHS trusts in England will be asked if they can run such clinics. On Monday, the Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation recommended that the gap between doses could be cut to as little as three months. However NHS chiefs have yet to announce a plan, amid wrangles with GPs over how the workload will be managed.Despite several days of talks, GPs have said they can only take on an expanded role if they stop providing millions of routine health checks.The new guidance is expected to say that the accelerated rollout - which cuts the gap between second and third dose to a minimum of three months, rather than six - should start by December 13 at the latest. Those aged in their 40s and 50s who have yet to receive their third jab will be in the first group called forward.More from NewsI met Donald Trump at 14 and flew with Prince Andrew, claims Ghislaine Maxwell\u0026#39s accuserGhislaine Maxwell trial latest: I wish I never received $5m from Epstein victims\u0026#39 fund, says accuserWorldwide health alert after cardiologist says he caught Covid variant during London conference tripSweeps in court for \u0026#39planting dead pigeons in customers\u0026#39 chimneys\u0026#39Countess of Christmas: Sophie gets into the party spirit on charity visitMichigan school shooting: Ethan Crumbley, 15, charged with terrorism and murder of four teensMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide health alert cardiologist says caught omicron covid","story":"A London medical conference attended by hundreds of the UK’s leading cardiologists has sparked a worldwide health alert after a heart specialist contracted the omicron variant.Organisers have issued a warning on its website to 1,200 delegates - about a third of them British - following a positive test for the new Covid-19 variant by a doctor from Israel.Dr Elad Maor, 45, who was fully vaccinated with three shots of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine, told The  he believed he contracted the omicron variant during his trip to London for the three-day conference that ended on November 23.

That in turn raises the prospect of dozens of cardiologists being forced to stay at home if they prove to be close contacts.Dr Maor said he arrived in London on November 19 and stayed in a hotel in Islington for four days before flying back to Israel. He attended the PCR London Valves conference, attended by 1,250 delegates from around the world, including Africa, where the strain first originated.Dr Maor, who works at the Sheba Medical Centre, had tested negative before boarding the flight home to Tel Aviv but began developing Covid-19 symptoms a few days later. He tested positive for the variant on November 27. By then, according to reports, he had performed several cardiac operations and came into contact with another cardiologist, aged 69, who is also now infected with the variant.Dr Maor said he spent 48 hours in bed at the weekend with flu-like symptoms including a cough and sore throat. He added that he was still feeling weak and hoped to recover soon.He said: I was questioned by the ministry of health in Israel once I was positive. They specifically asked me about the flight, what the seat was, and the flight number. I don\u0027t know if they contacted the ministry of health in London.He said he had taken great care to avoid picking up an infection by only removing his face mask in meetings and while eating.“We put a notice on our website and we aim to send a notice in our weekly newsletter.”The notice states: As per our protocol since the reported case comes less than a week after the end of PCR London Valves, we want to inform you so that you may decide the best course of action for yourself, if any.The National Health Service of the United Kingdom is responsible for tracking, tracing and liaison with contact cases and they will contact you if necessary.Mr Despax said the company learnt of the positive test after hearing about it on the “Twitter network”. Mr Despax added: “We contacted him to wish him a quick recovery and he said he was doing fine.”He said 60 per cent of the healthcare professionals at the conference were from the UK, about 30 per cent from Europe and 10 per cent from the rest of the world.The organisers had required proof of vaccination before allowing entry to the venue while Mr Maor, who travelled to the UK with his wife, had undertaken a PCR test on November 20, the day after he arrived in London, once more before flying home and third on arrival in Israel. All three were negative. More from NewsI met Donald Trump at 14 and flew with Prince Andrew, claims Ghislaine Maxwell\u0026#39s accuserGhislaine Maxwell trial latest: I wish I never received $5m from Epstein victims\u0026#39 fund, says accuserSweeps in court for \u0026#39planting dead pigeons in customers\u0026#39 chimneys\u0026#39Two more rounds of boosters to come as Government orders ‘variant-proof’ Covid vaccinesCountess of Christmas: Sophie gets into the party spirit on charity visitMichigan school shooting: Ethan Crumbley, 15, charged with terrorism and murder of four teensMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jacob rees mogg faces parliament","story":"Jacob Rees-Mogg: Parliament sleaze investigation launched over MPs undeclared earningsThe Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryne Stone has launched a formal investigation over claims the Commons leader failed to properly declare loans to his company Image: REUTERSByMikey SmithWhitehall CorrespondentNick SommerladInvestigations Editor:,  Dec Updated:,  Dec | commentsJacob Rees-Mogg faces a Parliament sleaze probe following claims he failed to properly declare £ million in cheap loans. The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryne Stone has launched a formal investigation, after it was alleged the Commons leader had failed to properly declare loans to his company. An update to the Commissioneraposs website, published today, said Mr Rees-Mogg was under investigation over the aposregistration of an interest under Category  of the Guide to the Rulesapos - adding that it was related to aposemployment and earningsapos. The site does not specy what the investigation relates to.But it comes after Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner wrote to the independent adviser on ministersapos interests, Lord Geidt, over a series of loans to Mr Rees-Moggaposs company Saliston Limited, between  and . In her letter, revealed by the Mirror last week, she said that failing to declare directoraposs loans worth £.m a year allowed Mr Rees-Mogg to borrow a large sum of money at a very low interest rate.She added: The financial benefit to Mr Rees-Mogg in this transaction is the dference in the interest he paid on this loan compared to a loan that he could take out on the open market from another provider, for example a bank. In this transaction, this dference is the value of the financial benefit transferred to Mr Rees-Mogg, which is a financial interest that should have been declared.  Mr Rees-Mogg borrowed up to £.m a year in directoraposs loans from his firm Saliston Ltd between  and . Although it does not specically identy directoraposs loans, the MPaposs code of conduct requires directors to declare taxable expenses, allowances and benefits. The Leader of the House of Commons stated that he was an unremunerated director and shareholder of the firm but did not mention he had taken out the loans. By using directoraposs loans he was able to borrow the large sum at very low interest rates.  UK company Saliston Ltd has previously been described as a holding company by Mr Rees-Mogg, with £m property assets, understood to include a Mayfair house. Saliston also has a stake in asset management firm Somerset Capital Management LLP, which Mr Rees-Mogg co-founded. He paid just £, interest to Saliston on £m of loans over three years, a rate of just .%. The deputy Labour leader and shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster pointed to a section of the ministerial code which says that ministers must ensure that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and their private interests, financial or otherwise. Downing Street refused to comment on the specics. The Prime Ministeraposs press secretary said: The Leader of the House of Commons has addressed this directly previously but beyond that itaposs a matter for the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, which is independent so you wouldnapost expect us to comment on it.

Mince pies baking  Mulled wine simmering  Nope, it’s the stench of utter hypocrisy… yet again. It takes quite something to make Matt Hancock look good – and he still doesn’t, but at least he resigned when caught breaking Covid rules. Boris Johnson instead appears to be adopting the approach of frenemy Dominic Cummings. He and his staff only attended crowded parties during lockdown to test their eyesight, presumably. We all tried to make the best of it, and hark back to Blitz Spirit and the like, but Christmas  was terrible. At best. At worst it was devastating, and tragic, because many were robbed of sharing a loved one’s last ever festive season. That the restrictions were necessary didn’t make them any less painful or easier to endure. The only thing that made the depressing damp squib of a yuletide in any way bearable was the knowledge that we were all in the same boat. So to find out now that a select few REDACT  or  were in fact enjoying Christmas perks like packed parties featuring festive quizzes and enough booze to make a festive quiz seem fun is just too much. Brings a whole new meaning to the term Secret Santa, doesn’t it   Once again, it’s a case of Do As I Say Not As I Do from this hideously corrupt bunch, who do not deny that these parties took place, but insist that “rules were followed.” Something of a contradiction in terms seeing as the rules literally were that these parties could not take place. Just like when the Johnsons were caught having an overnight guest during the peak of lockdown last Christmas, presumably the Prime Minister now considers this matter closed. Remember, he only begs for forgiveness when he loses his place in a speech about Peppa Pig.

We were at the theatre, to see a show my son had been learning about at school, a super special early Christmas treat.Behind us were five women in their thirties who, from the off, talked, and not even in stage ­whispers only during the big musical numbers. They chatted at the top of their voices throughout, as though they were at home in front of the telly rather than surrounded by people, and being incredibly rude to the performers on stage a few feet away. Half-way through the second act, I snapped. Although that makes it sound much more impressive than it was, because obviously I just meekly and incredibly Britishly pleaded with them to be quiet. Please. Thank you. Sorry. It did not go well. I was stupid for trying. What did I think they were going to say, “We had no idea we were disturbing you, please accept our apologies ”  Of course not. They knew they were being loud. They didn’t care. It reminded me of whenever I’ve seen anybody ask someone to wear a mask. The last time, it ended with the personanswering the polite, reasonable request with, “You f***king bitch, mind your own business”.The irony of saying that about a global pandemic – by definition, everyone’s business – seemingly lost here.Now there’s a potentially serious new iant, so we’re being asked to do something. The something that a worldwide study found to be the single most effective public health measure at tackling Covid. Wear a mask.  The reaction to this small ask, and my uncomfortable theatre experience, has left me with a depressing realisation. We’re not living in a Me First society. We’re living in a Me Me Me Me First society. This was impossible to ignore thanks to the amount of maskless people going about their business on Monday – in shops, on public transport , everywhere. They knew the mandate was coming into effect the following day, and why, but still they refused to take part in the communal effort to save Christmas – and, you know, lives – until there was no other option. Admittedly the messaging has been insane over the last few months. There will be some who think you must not need to wear a maskthe man with the most important job in the UK doesn’t. With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email. Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here. But there are others who know this isn’t the case, but don’t want to wear masks, so they just… don’t. Similar to the kind of person who feels like chatting loudly in a theatre, so just… does. Apart from no one diespeople talk in a theatre. The truth is that there are a lot of utterly selfish iniduals out there. We see it on a larger scale with rich countries not doing enough to supply vaccines to poorer ones because they’re too worried about themselves. And what gets lost is that helping them is the best thing we can dowe’re worried about ourselves, becauseeveryone’s vaccinated, spread is reduced and iants less likely to develop. We all need to look out for each other, with masks, with sharing vaccines, with compassion. Only then is there hope for us all.

Sophie Higginbottom, , tipped the scales at st and wore a size  before she lost half her body weight dieting with Slimming World and taking up running. Now Sophie of Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, can’t wait to become a ‘beautul bride’ after getting engaged and dropping to a svelte size eight. Sophie, who lives with fiancé, Alex, and their two greyhounds, now weighs a healthy st. She said: “I feel like this is the version of me that I was always supposed to be. “I had struggled with my weight since I was a teenager and couldn’t seem to get it under control. “I would always avoid cameras and just hated having my photo taken...it was getting to the point where I barely recognised myself.  “Planning a wedding is actually something I’m excited about, I definitely think it would have been something I dreaded before I lost weight. “I’ve been trying on some wedding dresses, and it was such a lovely experience. I felt beautul and really comfortable having my photograph taken, which is a world away from the way I felt when I was almost st heavier. “I’m so much more confident and full of le. Nothing feels out of reach any more, and that’s an amazing feeling.” Sophie joined Slimming World in January  after a charity fun run with her family to raise money for Alder Hey Hospital made her realise how unfit she was.  After finding her local group, she quickly got to grips with her new diet and was amazed when she lost five pounds in her first week of the plan. Following her incredible success, she has been named Slimming World’s ‘Woman of the Year’. Trainee psychologist Sophie said: “I’d tried lots of diets in the past, but nothing ever stuck because I felt so restricted. With Slimming World, I could still enjoy lots of hearty and delicious food. “At first, I thought my fiancé was dreading the food he would have to eat with me - but I soon changed his mind!  “Slimming World has changed my relationship with food for the better. I was scared of food before, now it’s my best friend. “I forward plan exciting and filling meals for the week ahead and I take it as a bit of a challenge to make Slimming World-friendly versions of all our favourite foods. “I’ve done an American feast of burgers and mac ‘n’ cheese, a big family Greek night and we still enjoy a cooked breakfast. It really has slotted into our lives so well and neither of us feel like we’re on a ‘diet’.”  Discovering a love for running during the lockdowns last year and overhauling her diet has seen Sophie shed a total of st  and  lbs. Sophie said: “Le was lacking joy previously - there was no excitement, no happiness. I would hide away, and would never put myself forward for things. “I was much more negative about myself. I didn’t look in the mirror before - it was better to avoid mirrors, to be honest. I would cut the labels out of clothes. I was so embarrassed about being overweight and the size that I was.  “I don’t think I would have planned a wedding before. I wouldn’t have been happy getting married at that point - I wasn’t happy myself. “The thought of trying on a wedding dress filled me with fear, but when I went to the shop with my mum, it was the most amazing experience. I feel like it’s made me the person I was always meant to be and now I’m just excited to be that person and live my le.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Slimming WorldAlder Hey hospitalHospitalsLoveMarriageWedding dressTeenagers\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He managed to get away with two mobile phones, an Amazon tablet, a handbag and its contents, a wallet, and a school bag and its contents. But the quick-thinking victim used his Find my iPhone app to locate Mitchell, who was so intoxicated on Valium he could not recall what he had done.  Police found him at a city hotel with some of the valuables he had stolen from the family home, Plymouth Crown Court heard. He was also caught with a computer tower he had had stolen from the University of Plymouth, and later admitted breaking into two cars. Mitchell has  previous convictions for burgling homes. Sending him back to prison for almost two and a half years, a judge said that a neighbouraposs camera had shown Mitchell snooping around homes in Plymstock. Judge David Evans added: Less than two weeks after you were released on licence, you committed this burglary, with two children under ten in the house. You stole items belonging to one of them. It is clear from the victim statement that the family felt unable to stay in their own home and they booked into a hotel for the following night. Mitchell, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to burglary of the home in Killerton Lane between October  and October . He asked for three other offences to be taken into consideration over the same period - the burglary of the university building and theft of cash and a digital camera from two cars. Judge Evans jailed him for  days, which is the statutory three-year term for a three-strike domestic burglar minus the maximum  per cent discount.

Shek Farsi Ahmed Shah, the restaurantaposs owner, said he believed the party was within lockdown rules because it was a wedding with  guests, Bolton Magistratesapos Court heard on Wednesday. Just a week before the wedding had taken place  people had died from Covid- across the UK in a single day.PC Andrew Hopwood from Greater Manchester Police had gone into the restaurant through an open door and found people sat down inside. Prosecutor Hamza Soren told the court: He witnessed approximately  guests present. The guests appeared to be having a sit-down meal. Decorations were on each table, there were aposMr and Mrsapos gt boxes and there were floral decorations around the restaurant. Guests were in formal attire. Females were wearing expensive-looking, traditional Asian gowns. It was clear that there was an organised, formal event taking place. The court heard that at this point PC Hopwood was approached by Shah, who confirmed he was the owner and claimed the event did not breach Covid rules. Mr Soren said:response was that he thought he was allowed  people to attend as it was a wedding.explained that by allowing guests to have a sit-down meal he had breached the restrictions. Mr Soren said the officer was then informed that there were more guests in the downstairs area of the restaurant.  Downstairs, PC Hopwood also found a wedding cake on the table, along with wedding favours and drinks bottles that had the same names on as the couple who were married. In total it was estimated there were  people present including children under , Mr Soren added. There were  staff members on duty, either cooking in the kitchen or serving food. Shah was handed a £ fixed penalty notice, while  guests were also slapped with fines. Mr Soren added: The defendantaposs behaviour was crass and irresponsible given the circumstances about the spread of Covid. He says he has admitted breaching the legislation. Despite that, for reasons known only to himself, he decided to arrange this wedding with young children and adults present. We can only speculate whether there were any infections as a result of that, but the legislation applied to everyone. It was there for a reason and the actions of the defendant were inexcusable and irresponsible. Shah, of Blackburn Road, told magistrates there were a aposnumber of things that were not accurateapos in Bolton Councilaposs account of proceedings.

This yearaposs ceremony comes after the industry faced many challenges due to the Covid pandemic. British Curry Awards Founder, Enam Ali MBE, said: What a year we have had – full of highs and lows as we have come out of the pandemic and had to try and rebuild our businesses after lockdowns. The support of our customers has been incredible but the challenges are still signicant.  He cited an issue with restaurants that are typically four or five stars getting knocked down for fairly minor, technical infringements and the process for reassessment can take up to six months. He added: What we are asking for is the government to require local authorities to have a much faster appeal and recertication process so that those marked down can be reassessed in - weeks, not - months. Otherwise, we will not be able to play our part in the recovery of our high streets, as this inflexible process will prove the straw that breaks the camelaposs back.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a message: “I’m delighted that one of the greatest events in our gastronomic calendar, the Curry Oscars, is back in action and it is fantastic to celebrate the genius of our curry restaurateurs who have, for decades, offered their fragrant medleys.

Health officials in the area, said it was highly probable that the Covid iant had been discovered there, and said it is taking precautionary action against its spread. The B. . . iant, known as Omicron, was first identied in southern Africa, but has since been reported in at least  other countries but is expected to be far more widespread. Cases in the UK have been found from Glasgow, to Liverpool, Norfolk and London as the government works to try and keep the new iant from spilling out of control. See the full list of where it is in the UK below. Since its discovery the government has announced tighter restrictions, including requiring mask wearing on public transport. So far, every confirmed case in the UK has been tested and along with their contacts are isolating.  The full list of cases where the Omicron iant is across the UK: Barnet –  Bolton -  Brentwood –  Camden –  Glasgow -  Haringey –  Lanarkshire -  Liverpool –  North Norfolk –  Nottingham –  Sutton –  Wandsworth –  Westminster –  Health officials have said that it is “highly probable” that there are two more cases of the Omicron iant in Bolton. The iniduals that tested positive are said to be linked, and members of their households are being re-tested and are self-isolating. Dr Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of UKHSA, said: “We are continuing our efforts to understand the effect of this iant on transmissibility, severe disease, mortality, antibody response and vaccine efficacy. “Vaccination is critical to help us bolster our defences against this new iant – please get your first, second, third or booster jab without delay. Following the change in JCVI advice yesterday, a booster dose for everyone over  years is now recommended at a minimum of  months from your last primary course jab. Please take up this offer as soon as you are invited to protect yourself, your families and your communities.  “Please make sure to wear a mask in line with government guidance, including on public transport and in shops, to help break the chains of transmission and slow the spread of this new iant. “It is very likely that we will find more cases over the coming days as we are seeing in other countries globally and as we increase case detection through focused contact tracing. That’s why it’s critical that anyone with Covid- symptoms isolates and gets a PCR test immediately.”  All nine of Scotland’s Omicron cases can be traced back to a single event, which took place on November . First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament that this suggested that there was community transmission already happening within the UK. She added that more cases were likely over the coming days, which could also be linked to this super-spreader event. Most of England’s cases focus in and around London.  The case in Brentwood, Essex, was linked to a local KFC branch but all staff tested negative and the fast food chain has reopened since. One of the cases in Westminster involved an inidual who left the country shortly after. Wales and Northern Ireland are yet to report a confirmed case of the new iant.

The government is keen for anyone who shows any covid symptom to take a free PCR, which can be booked here. But many Brits have been coughing and sneezing more than usual – and there have even been reports of it being the worst cold ever so itaposs important to be able to tell the dference between the two coronavirus iants, a cold and the flu. What are the symptoms of a cold  According to the NHS, the symptoms of a cold can come on gradually, and include:A blocked or runny noseA sore throat HeadachesMuscle aches Coughs A raised temperature Pressure in your ears and face Loss of taste and smell  What are the symptoms of the flu  The NHS says flu symptoms can include:a sudden fever – a temperature of C or above an aching body feeling tired or exhausted a dry cough a sore throat a headache dficulty sleeping loss of appetite diarrhoea or tummy pain feeling sick and being sickWhat are the main Covid symptoms According to the NHS, the main coronavirus symptoms are: A high temperature A new, continuous cough A loss or change to your sense of smell or tasteMost of the above symptoms are the first that were officially recognised by the government and are still the accepted ones linked to the Delta iant.Statistics from South Africa, where the Omicron iant was first detected and sequenced, has shown that there have been no hospital admissions and no deaths from people with Omicron.Doctors also say people recover from it in just a few days after symptoms, including tiredness, headache and muscle aches, pass.  Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, who was one of the first people to suspect the Omicron Covid strain, has said she noticed patients at her private clinic showing symptoms that are dferent from the Delta iant.Dr Coetzee told the AFP that she alerted health officials of a clinical picture that doesnapost fit Delta on  November when seven patients showed dferent symptoms that seemed very much related to normal viral infection. She said her patients presented with extreme tiredness, mild muscle aches, scratchy throat and dry cough. Unlike the previous iants, this one doesnapost cause loss of taste or smell, she added.

Elad Maor, a cardiologist at Sheba Medical Centre near Tel Aviv, believes he may have become infected with the new iant while attending a major medical conference at the convention centre ExCeL London. The PCR London Valves  conference, which took place between  and  November, was attended by , people – some of whom were not wearing face masks. The allegations made by Mr Maor, a dad of three and an associate professor of cardiology at Tel Aviv University, raise questions about how early the B... iant was present in the UK and Europe. It comes after Dutch officials said on Tuesday that the Omicron iant was already in the Netherlands a week before South Africa reported the iant to the World Health Organisation.  The recent revelations about the iant’s existence in Europe challenge previous ideas about where and how the iant originated, and whether travel bans on southern African countries are an appropriate response to the iant.In an interview with the , Mr Maor, who is currently self-isolating in his home in Israel, said he was convinced he had become infected in the UK,“I got the Omicron in London, for sure,” he said. “That is interesting because that was  days ago in London – really, really early.” Mr Maor, who had received three doses of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, described arriving in London on  November and staying four nights at a hotel in Islington, north London. After a three-day meeting at ExCeL London in Newham, east London, he ed to Israel on  November. He began to experience Covid- symptoms within days and tested positive on  November. He has so far shown mild symptoms including a fever, muscle ache and a sore throat.Pictures of the medical conference taken by Mr Maor reportedly show not all attendees were wearing masks, although people were asked to show proof of vaccination before being allowed entry. The Europa Group, which organised the PCR London Valves , has confirmed it had learned on  November that a delegate had tested positive for Covid after ing to their home country. A spokesperson for the Europa Group told the : “As you may imagine, the health, safety and wellbeing of everyone who visited PCR London Valves was our number one priority. “All protocols mandated by the UK government were put in place. Anyone entering the congress centre had to present a valid health pass and were requested to wear a mask. Hydro-alcoholic gel and masks were made readily available for all participants and disposal bins for used protective equipment were provided.” Mr Maor who travelled to the conference using the London Underground and Docklands Light Railway each day, said he was “surprised” when he saw not everyone was wearing a face covering on public transport - a common sight on the London transport network.  He undertook a PCT test on  November – his second day in the UK – and again on  November – the first day of the conference – as per UK and Israeli travel rules. He flew from London via Heathrow airport at pm on  November – the final day of the conference. Upon arrival at Tel Aviv, he had a third PCR test – which also came back negative. Mr Maor said he may have also infected a -year-old colleague after flying back from London. The colleague has since tested positive for the Omicron iant. He ed to work at the Sheba Medical Centre after testing negative when ing to Israel, before developing symptoms and testing positive from a fourth PCR test.  Mr Maor was the third confirmed Omicron case in Israel, and the first in the country with no travel links to southern Africa.

Weaposre free to party, toke the occasional cig, sleep with whoever we want to, and nurse our hangovers with fast food and sleep. But for many young gay men, including myself, the fear surrounding HIV and Aids can be crippling - evenweaposre not exposing ourselves to potential infection. In the aposs, the Aids crisis, also known as the aposgay plagueapos, had the world in a panicked chokehold. It was seen as a stark death sentence, a self-inflicted consequence of a dirty lestyle a decade of tragedy. And while medical understanding has advanced by leaps and bounds - the stigma surrounding the virus still echoed on to younger generations.I was six years old when Section  was finally abolished in England and Wales. The notorious law, brought in during Thatcheraposs administration, prohibited schools from talking about homosexuality. But a decade later, at the ripe old age of , I still hadnapost received any form of LGBTQ+ sex education at secondary school or sixth form. I didnapost know that HIV was no longer the death sentence that it once was, or what aposundetectableapos meant, or why as a teen who hadnapost even had sex I was so afraid of it. Because I really was petried at times.  At school, youaposd regularly hear jokes about people being bummed and getting Aids - but no teacher attempted to correct the ignorance or debunk the myths. And for some reason, I couldnapost talk to anyone about my constant panic of dying - because the stigma surrounding the virus is still re, and education is still so poor.  In fact, according to sexual health charity Terrence Higgins Trust, the most recent estimate suggests there were , people living with HIV in the UK in . Of these, around , are undiagnosed and do not know they are HIV positive. Equally alarming,  percent of people living with HIV have never shared their status with anyone outside of their healthcare workers. Now, my experience with health anxiety is nothing compared to the thousands of people living with HIV who face discrimination on a daily basis. But it highlights how strong the reverberations of the aposs crisis are - and how important it is we begin to educate children about HIV. Today is World Aids Day - but headlines surrounding Covid continue to dominate. Perhaps because Aids is still seen as a gay comeuppance that doesnapost really affect the straight world - or maybe because the stigma is so ingrained into our society itaposs impossible to smash. But we must break through. If not, history could easily repeat itself.HIV is the name of a virus. Aids is the name for a collection of illnesses caused by this virus. HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. ‘Immunodeficiency’ refers to the weakening of the immune system by the virus. HIV has been passed on between humans for many decades but was only identied in the early s.AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. It is a collection of illnessescaused by a virus people pick upthat makes their immune system weak . You can’t get an AIDS diagnosis unless you’re already HIV positive. In the s and early s, most people with HIV were eventually diagnosed with AIDS. Now, thanks to modern antiretroviral treatment, very few people in the UK develop serious HIV-related illnesses. The term Aids isn’t used much by UK doctors. Instead they talk about late-stage or advanced HIV. If left untreated, infection with HIV progresses through a series of stages: from flu-like seroconversion illness, through infections associated with the symptomatic stage, leading to late-stage HIV or AIDS. If someone with HIV has a detectable viral load, they can pass on HIV through blood, semen, vaginal fluid, anal mucus and breast milk. HIV is not passed on by spitting, sneezing or coughing, nor by kissing or general social contact. HIV can’t survive for very long once itaposs outside the human body. Studies have shown that a person whoaposs on effective treatment who has an undetectable viral load canapost pass on HIV.

In the months before her diagnosis in , the -year-old had lost three stone and was so ill that she collapsed in the hospital where she was sent for clinical assessment.It followed years of unexplained symptoms, during which time her blood was taken numerous times - but she was never tested for HIV. Ahead of World AIDS Day on December , Sandra is sharing her story in the hope it can raise awareness around testing and ensure people get the vital treatment they need sooner. Despite experiencing a number of chest infections and symptoms linked with HIV - such as unexplained night sweats, weight loss, coldsores and thrush for  years - she said medics never even considered the virus. She believes that because of her age, location and not falling into a group with a high prevalence of HIV, medics overlooked the possibility that she could have the illness.  It wasnapost until July , after being sent to hospital in Harrogate that Sandra, from North Yorkshire, was finally given the answer she needed. The doctor told me that I was HIV positive, she recalled. I thought he was going to say stage four cancer. It was a relief to know what it was. By that stage her condition was so advanced that medics said she needed immediate urgent treatment at St Jamesapos University in Leeds to save her le. I was pretty far gone, I was at the stage where it was goodbye, Sandra said. They said that within  hours it would be critical. I was in hospital for the whole of August , they saved my le.  Sandra said: I donapost know whether they discarded the idea that I had it, or just didnapost think of it at all. I just hope one or two of them went home and had a couple of nightmares. If anyone had said to letaposs do an HIV test Iaposd have said yes, by all means. An earlier diagnosis would have made a huge dference. If I had stayed at home, I live on my own, trying to live with this illness I could have died. I just donapost know why I wasnapost tested. Because of the weight loss I wonderedit was cancer that was being missed. She said she hopes her experience encourages medics to ensure patients are checked for HIV. Sandra said: Iaposve lived in fear that I was going to slip through the net. Iaposm an example of what can happen, but I donapost want this to be a sob story about me. I want to show that GPs should test for everything, itaposs only a simple blood test.  Sandra, who believes she had been HIV positive for  years before it was diagnosed, is now able to manage her condition through medication - although she said the amount of tablets she takes is higher than it would beshe had been diagnosed early. I donapost feel like Iaposm fading away, which is how I felt before, she said. Recent highly acclaimed TV drama Itaposs A Sin, which tackled the emergence of the AIDS epidemic in the s, was a hard watch, Sandra said. It shows people dying from AIDS, it was like a blow to the head because to me thataposs how I was when I went into St Jamesapos. It was only then that I realised Iaposd been living with it all through  and years and years prior to it.Sandra now volunteers with HiVitality, a charity which provides retreats for people with the condition to spent time with others in the same position.There are people out there that need reaching and need help, this is something that they need, she said. Charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, which provides support for people with HIV, said that the delay in identying Sandraaposs condition shouldnapost have happened, and said she was not tested until it was nearly too late. It is campaigning for opt-out testing at AE departments - meaning blood taken from patients is tested for HIV unless they say no - a move Sandra said she agrees with. Liz Porter, clinical director at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: Sandra’s story is such a sad one and it absolutely shouldn’t have happened. Sandra was presenting with a lot of the indicators of undiagnosed HIV, including unexplained weight loss, coldsores and thrush, and yet no one thought to test her until it was almost too late. Sandra’s is an extreme and rare example of incredibly late diagnosis, but the latest data shows that % of people diagnosed with HIV are still being diagnosed late. Which means the diagnosis comes after damage to the immune system has already begun. This is worst in those aged  and over where a shocking % of people are diagnosed late. Too often both iniduals and health professionals don’t think of HIV affecting certain groups, for example a white woman in her s like Sandra. Ms Porter said that routine testing in Sandraaposs area could have made. a big dference and avoided the health problems she is now experiencing. She stated: Routine testing across healthcare is a clear way to avoid this happening to others, alongside educating professionals about HIV and what indicator conditions to look out for. If routine testing had been in place where Sandra lives, she would have been diagnosed years earlier with a simple test at her GP and avoided the health problems she is now experiencing.

The victim, Hasan Hussain, suffered a large wound to the side of his jaw and multiple penetrating wounds to the side of his face and ear. The horric incident unfolded after Neil got into a verbal spat with a group of teenagers at a Morrisons store in Brierfield, Preston Crown Court heard.  After accusing the teenagers of pushing in front of him in a queue, the -year-old aimed a racial slut at one of the group before leaving the store. He also said: “I will kill you and your family.” The teenagers followed after Neil as he made his way into an alleyway and beat him up. When he got back to his feet he placed a nine second call to his brother, Lee, who quickly made his way to Brierfield from Burnley. Witnesses reported seeing the brothers banging metal objects on railings close to a community centre in Brierfield town centre as they hunted down the young people.  At that point the group ran off in dferent directions along with innocent bystanders who had nothing to do with the earlier assault or verbal altercation. One of those was the -year-old victim Mr Hussain, who after getting split from his friends was approached by axe-wielding Neil. The pair grappled to the floor before Lee shouted at his brother to: “Hold him. Hold him.” Lee then shot Mr Hussain at close range with a shotgun, causing serious injuries to his face. A CT scan revealed multiple pieces of shotgun pellet in his head, which required surgery to remove.  He also suffered damage to the nerve which controls the movement of the lower lip, and a damaged tooth. Judge Andrew Jefferies QC said it was only by way of chance that the youngster was not more seriously injured. He added: In some of the images the shotgun appears to have been shortened although the lighting and conditions I can not be sure. It is mercul Hasan Hussain survived. Police launched a major investigation and the brothers, both of Kinross Street, Burnley, were arrested the following day at Burnley Recycling Centre. Lee Barnett pleaded guilty to attempted murder and Neil pleaded guilty to Section  wounding, causing grievous bodily harm with intent. The brothers appeared side by side on a videolink from prison as they were sentenced at Preston Crown Court.  Judge Jefferies said: This was an offence which was motivated by revenge and utilised a highly dangerous weapon. The judge said both brothers were dangerous offenders and posed a risk to the public. Neil used racially aggravated language during the attack and while the judge said he was quite certain Lee was also a racist, he would have carried out the offence against anyone who wronged his brother. He sentenced Lee Barnett to  years in prison, noting the defendant would be nearing his th birthday before he is released. Neil was jailed for seven years and two months with a three year extended licence period. DCI Jane Webb, of Lancashire Police’s Force Major Investigation Team, said: “The level of violence used by Lee and Neil Barnett was shocking, completely disproportionate and could have easily resulted in the death of an innocent young man. “After being involved in an earlier altercation with a group of males, Neil Barnett recruited his brother in his search for vengeance and they launched a cowardly attack on a man who was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. “The defendants chose not to answer any questions during their police interviews. Thanks to the overwhelming evidence compiled by our dedicated investigation team – very much supported by the local community who willingly provided us with the critical CCTV evidence in this case – the defendants were left with little option but to admit what they had done. “I hope these sentences send out the strong message that violence of any kind will not be tolerated in Lancashire, and that we will work with our colleagues at the Crown Prosecution Service to bring those responsible to justice.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Lancashire PoliceCCTV footagePrison sentence\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Christmas tree in London’s Trafalgar Square is one of London’s most iconic displays and has a long history attached to it. Every year since , a  metre tall tree gets shipped from Oslo to London as a sign of gratitude for Britainaposs support during World War II. Itaposs felled in Oslo in a ceremony attended by the Lord Mayor of Westminster, the British ambassador to Norway, and the Mayor of Oslo, then shipped to London by sea and decorated in Trafalgar Square in traditional Norwegian fashion. It is currently being decorated and is set to be lit on December . But this year, Londoners are underwhelmed with the tree, which appears to be a little scant on both branches and pine needles in its middle section.One passerby shared a photo of the tree to Twitter and the reactions soon started pouring in, with many left unimpressed.Does it get dressed with extra branches or is that it  asked one person, referring to the tree looking sparse. “Interflora clearly forgot to include the little sachet of plant feed,” one user quipped. The comment prompted Interflora’s official account to pipe up, commenting: “Our sachets are amazing, but not sure even theyaposd do the trick here...! Have we fallen out with Norway ! another person said, while a fourth person asked jokingly Did it get delivered by Hermes  Dear me, thataposs a bit flea bitten, complained another user.  Where’s the rest of it  It’s Gonna need a lot of tinsel to jazz that up! another person wrote. But others were quick to jump to the treeaposs defence. One Twitter user wrote: I was there  weeks ago for the tree felling ceremony, a very proud moment for me but also Norway. We must always remember why this happens, also you’d probably need to drop out a little on one sideyou weighed several tons and had a two week journey. It’s Christmas people. Another said I think that’s just how that age of tree is. Should look finethey garland the lights on it in a scalloping pattern, rather than the taut vertical lines they did last year which accentuated it’s slenderness. A very nice gt and a good tradition. The so-called “official” Trafalgar Tree account eventually chimed in, commenting: “Over  comments about ME”.“Is it fair to say I am possibly the most famous tree in the world! #HatersGonnaHate #ChristmasSpirit ,” they commented.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON World War Christmas trees\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The  movie features an all-star ensemble cast from Emma Thompson and Keira Knightley, to Colin Firth and Hugh Grant - not forgetting the late, great Alan Rickman. For those unfamiliar with the plot, it follows  dferent stories, delving into ying aspects of love as each of the relationships are somewhat interlinked. But it’s not just the actors that dazzle on set - in fact, London looks simply stunning lit up for the holidays as the film takes place in ious locations around the city. Right now, you’d feature around half-way through the film, as it’s set five weeks before Christmas, played out in a countdown to December . That means it’s the perfect time to hit the Big Smoke and visit some of the stunning set locations where the festive favourite was filmed. Soyou want to pretend you’re a fly on the wall at Juliet’s house while Mark declares his love with cards, or recreate the scene where Sam runs after Joanna in the airport, here are some of the locations you could visit. Heathrow Airport  Hugh Grant’s iconic voiceover opens the movie at Heathrow Airport - which is where the film ends, too. Playing the Prime Minister, he says: “Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world, I think about the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport. General opinion’s starting to make out that we live in a world of hatred and greed, but I don’t see that. It seems to me that love is everywhere... “When the planes hit the Twin Towers, as far as I know, none of the phone calls from the people on board were messages of hate or revenge – they were all messages of love. If you look for it, I’ve got a sneaky feeling you’ll find that love actually is all around.” It sets the fuzzy, warm tone of the holiday movie, as hidden cameras in Heathrow’s Terminal  captured real-le emotional reunions in the arrivals hall, with the people featured then asked for permission to use the clips. Selfridges  On busy Oxford Street, it was at the department store Selfridges where Alan Rickman, as Harry, purchased a necklace for a woman who wasn’t his we, Karen . He buys the gt for a colleague named Mia, with a shopping assistantwho makes the gt wrapping process a painstaking one for Harry. Somerset House  The central court of Somerset House, in The Strand, is where the skating rink in the opening montage was filmed. Formerly a parking lot, the court is now home to  fountains in summer, and the ice rink in winter, which is open to the public.If you fancy pretending you’re an extra in the scene, you canbook ticketsto the rink from £ per person.Notting Hill  Notting Hill features in Love Actually not once, but twice. First it’s home to the recording studio where Billyrecords his cheesy Christmas song at Westway Studios. But we see the popular neighbourhood again, at St Luke’s Mews where Mark professes his love to Juliet in that iconic cards scene. The unmistakable cobbled streets and coloured properties make for a beautul filming location, made all the more stunning by the festive lights. Queen’s Walk  If you’re a London regular, you’ve probably taken it walk along the south bank of the River Thames numerous times. It’s on these benches where Liam Neeson’s character, Daniel, has an emotional heart-to-heart with his son, where he discovers he’s not just distracted, he’s in love, actually. To be even more precise, the bench is on Gabriel’s Wharf, in front of the Riviera Restaurant.

It’s also the church - which is Grade II* listed - where Peter marries Juliet to ‘All You Need is Love’. Where  can you visit Love Actually filming locations  Whether you’re a fan of the film or not, Trafalgar Square is well worth a visit to see the huge Christmas tree - a traditional gt from Norway. And while the scenes set at  Downing Street were filmed at Shepperton Studios, you could always take a trip to see the landmark which was ‘home’ to Hugh Grant. Other notable filming locations in the festive film include Grosvenor Chapel, Millennium Bridge, Marble Arch and the OXO Tower, as well as Elliott School in Pullman Gardens where the Christmas concert was filmed.

After realising that the deal so far had cost them £, a minute, Spoty has reportedly been left mystied as to why the couple have not produced any content, according to The Sun.  The music and podcast service is said to have contacted their pairaposs Archewell Audio brand to ensure they protect the future of the multimillion-pound contract. One source told the newspaper: “Spoty were delighted when they signed the couple, but the lack of content has mystied them. Particularly as they seem to have no problem producing content for other s.” After hiring veteran podcast producer, Rebecca Sanaes, the couple are believed to be releasing a whole set of new episodes in time for this Christmas.  Another source said: “When Harry and Meghan signed the Spoty deal in December, they didn’t really have a full audio team behind them, there were no scripts ready and they hadn’t made podcasts before. The holiday special episode was whacked together but, even though it was well received by fans, it was hard for them to pull off.” Harry and Meghan began looking for commercial deals after they were cut off by the Princeaposs family following their decision to break away from all Royal duties. The pair now live in a £million mansion in Montecito, Calornia.Angela Levin, Prince Harry ’s biographer, said: “Harry and Meghan want to do too many things at the same time.” Legal experts say Harry and Meghan will need to meet any deadlines stipulated in their contract to secure the funds. Alex Cook, Partner at Helix Law, a specialist litigation firm of solicitors, added: It might be considered embarrassing for Harry, Megan and Spoty equally to air any dispute publicly and it wouldn’t be surprisingthere are private commercial arbitration clauses to manage any disputes between them all. Archewell Audio was approached for comment while Spoty said last night: “Big things are coming.

The video is a part of a project for The People’s Vaccine Alliance as part of a World Health Organisation and UNAIDS event. Harry said: There are striking parallels between Covid- and another deadly pandemic. One that emerged  years ago - HIV. The video also features clips of Prince Harry’s mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, meeting Aids patients.  The Duke of Sussex added: This is a story about how corporate greed and political failure have prolonged both pandemics and what we can do to stop it. By ending vaccine monopolies and sharing technology, companies in the developing world can start producing Covid vaccines too...Break the monopolies...deliver a Peopleaposs Vaccine. Alongside the video, Prince Harry also wrote a letter to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Ms Byanyima. In it he wrote how “deeply grateful” his mother, who was known for helping to break stigma around HIV and Aids, would have been for their achievements. The letter was read out by the WHOaposs director of global HIV, hepatitis and STIs programmes Dr Meg Doherty at the event. Harry wrote: On this World Aids Day we recognise the  years that have shaped le for many.  We honour those whose lives have been cut short and reaffirm our commitment to a scientic community that has worked tirelessly against this disease. My mother would be deeply grateful for everything you stand for and have accomplished. We all share that gratitude, so thank you. In sharp comparison he called the rollout of the Covid vaccine globally a “spectacular failure”. The Prince called vaccinating the world a test of “our moral character” and said the world was failing.  He said: Similar to the Aids crisis, weaposve yet again revealed over the past year that the value of le depends on whether you were born and or live in a rich nation, or a developing country. Now more than ever, the voiceless majority of the world needs to be heard and the onus is on our leaders to end this pandemic.” He warned that repeating failures that surrounded and worsened the Aids epidemic would be a “betrayal of the next generation”. He called on world leaders to learn lessons from the past “where millions died unnecessarily” due to unequal access to treatment.

The Buckingham Palace workman was visiting to dismantle a desk when an unexpected person offered him a brew. Speaking on Channel  documentary Secrets of the Royal Palaces, Royal Upholsterer Kevin Andrews, who worked for the late Queen Mother, explained what happened. He said: “A builder was dismantling a desk so he could not see who was making the offer when the ladyaposs voice asked himhe would like a cup of tea.”  Without realising it was the Queen herself who answered, he is said to have replied: “Yeah. In a mug. Two sugars. Builderaposs tea. “I donapost want any of that nonsense I had the last time I was here, all that fine china and all that saucer stuff.” Without saying anything, the Queen dropped off his cup of tea on the table, and by the time he went to pick it up the builder could only look on as he saw her walking away. The Queen is likely to have found the encounter funny, as she is known for her humour and good nature when she meets oblivious people. Like the time a hapless group of tourists once bumped into the Queen walking around her Balmoral estate - but didnapost recognise her. The monarch was out for a low-key walk in tweeds and a headscarf, something she likes to do when she gets the chance.  One of her former protection officers has revealed the -year-old likes to slip under the radar when possible. Richard Grfin claims that once a group of American tourists failed to recognise her.Speaking to The Times, Richard said the Queen didnapost want to blow her cover at the time.She went along with the tourists as they questioned whether she lived in the area, replying that she had a house nearby. When they asked hersheaposd ever met the Queen, all she said was No, but this policeman has, gesturing towards Mr Grfin. Richard - who worked closely with the monarch for more than  years - said the group then moved on, having no idea who theyaposd just met.

The monarch reportedly told Mr Osborne during the state banquet in  to ask the then-US president to leave because she was tired.The ex-chancellor made the remarks at a talk with Lord Ed Vaizey, a former Tory member of Parliament and minister, hosted by the Old Pauline Club, an association for alumni of St. Paulaposs School, Insider reports.

The high profile three-day state visit was only the third by a US president to the UK in  years and included a lavish state banquet and a meeting with the newly-married Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.  At the red-carpeted Grand Entrance of the Palace, the president and the first lady Michelle Obama were greeted by the monarch and the Duke of Edinburgh. The Queen toasted the UK’s “special relationship” with the US and thanked America for twice coming to the rescue of the “free world” in two world wars. She said: “Your visit to this country inevitably reminds us of our shared history, our common language, and our strong intellectual and cultural links. “It also reminds us that your country twice came to the rescue of the free and democratic world when it was facing military disaster. “On each occasion, after the end of those destructive wars, the generosity of the United States made a massive contribution to our economic recovery. “Today the United States remains our most important ally and our two nations contribute to the security and prosperity of our peoples, and of the world, through shared national interests.” She told the assembled VIP guests that when the two countries stand together “our people and other people of goodwill around the world will be more secure and can become more prosperous”.

I would describe the level of cooking as basic.  Waiters were friendly but also a bit of a gimmick they were making annoying sounds when they were cutting our baklava.

Then aged , on the day of her first GCSE exam in May , she learned she had Ewing sarcoma, a rare bone cancer. “I remember thinking, I hope they don’t cancel our holiday – because I thought I’d be fine in a few weeks. It was disbelief,” recalls Lulu, now . Mum Carolyn, , says: “Lulu had been complaining of a pain in her lower leg and she was referred for a biopsy.” Treated at Weston Park Hospital, in Sheffield, she embarked on intensive chemotherapy. “It was scary,” says Lulu, whose dad is teacher Stephen, . “Lulu was there five days in a row,  hours a day getting chemo,” says executive head teacher Carolyn. “It was brutal. She’d have five days, then a week off, another five, then a week off, for  months. She is extraordinary.” By Jason Beattie For the majority of families this Christmas will be a joyous time of presents, food and fun. But for some children the festive season will be very dferent. Across the country there are more than , young people who are critically ill. Many will be spending what should be a special time of the year in hospital. Others will have to have treatment, scans or blood tests. With your help we can give them a Christmas that they will always remember. This year’s Mirror Christmas Appeal is raising funds for Make-A-Wish UK that helps seriously ill young people make their dreams come true.It could be they want to meet their hero or heroine or feed an animal at the zoo or travel to see Santa in Lapland. The money raised could help Joshua, six, who has severe epilepsy, achieve his wish of a bedroom makeover or Summer, also six, who has acute leukaemia and dreams of a bouncy castle. Each year Make-A-Wish helps hundreds of critically ill children achieve their letime’s ambition. But to make a wish come true takes an army of volunteers, supporters and donors. That’s why every penny you donate could make a dference. Granting a wish can transform a child’s le. It gives them something to look forward to. For others it provides a special memory which makes the treatment they need more bearable.It can also help their parents who, despite doing everything they can for their sick child, feel it is not enough. Jason Suckley, Make-A-Wish UK chief executive, said: “I met the family of a boy who was recovering from brain surgery. “His grandmother told me how dficult it had been for her to watch her daughter struggle with the challenges of her son’s condition.But while they were enjoying his wish together, her daughter turned to her and said, ‘There is still magic in this world isn’t there mum ’ . “That’s just one instance that illustrates how the power of a wish lies in sharing positive memories with loved ones. “Every donation from Mirror readers will help us create those memories – bringing joy to ill children and their families during the darkest of times.” In October , Lulu had her lower left leg amputated at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in Birmingham. “Lulu ended up in high dependency, and six or seven times we thought we might lose her,” says Carolyn. Thankfully, Lulu, whose brother Seth is  months younger, pulled through. “I’d known from when I was diagnosed it was going to be amputated, it was the best option,” Lulu says.

So start planning now. And while it’s fun to celebrate Christmas by going out partying and having huge family dinners, Covid seems determined to ruin the fun. But I have to admit there is a lot to be said for keeping things small, simple and just staying indoors. I’ve had quite a few conversations with people who’ve said that as much as they missed their families last year, it was quite nice to stay in their own home and do things their way. No squabbling between the adults and children over what time to have lunch or open presents. People were relieved there was much less pressure and felt they were able to have a good time.

Sadly that union also fell apart, only for them to give it another go shortly after they officially split. Similar problems crept into their marriage once more, leading Monette to put a ring on another man. However, as much as she loved his kids, the pair proved not to be a forever couple.“Number five was probably one of the loves of my le,” she said on T LC ’s Addicted to Marriage.“Husband number six just seemed so nice and kind so I married him and then I married him again.”  While some people may have hung up their wedding shows after number seven, Monette is not one to be deterred.

Daniel said: “I started seeing lots of items left around so a wave of excitement took hold as I went inside. “I could tell it was going to be interesting to look at this place. “The atmosphere was calm at first, however at times it became quite eerie – we would hear random noises throughout the house that put us a little on edge.”  The explorer guessed the property had been abandoned for only a couple of years, although they found old-fashioned televisions and dated furnishings throughout the home. And among the creepiest items left behind at the property was an array of bizarre children’s toys that looked as though they had come straight from a horror film. One wooden doll could be seen laying in a cot and had bright blue eyes that were much cleaner than the rest of her face.  While another doll made of porcelain was found in one of the upstairs bedrooms and had been persevered in its box. Daniel also found antique items including stacks of china crockery and ornaments and an entire shelf filled with bottles of wine. In his video, he exclaimed: “Thereaposs got to be thousands of pounds worth of stuff here.” What’s more, the explorer found a vintage Melotte hand-cranked cream separator, which was used in the dairy industry in the th century.  Daniel explored the property with his friend Steve, and the pair were “blown away” by everything they saw. He said: “The main area that caught my surprise was in the basement where the majority of the collectables were squirrelled away and other random antiques. “To the right people and collectors some of these inidual items could be worth hundreds. “We were left wondering why such a place had become like this – we were blown away by everything we saw.” Have you got a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Something about the idea made us fall in love with it.Whataposs more, there have been loads of people using the opportunity to raise money for charities that meant something to them. Liz works at Grace House, a charity providing short breaks for disabled children, and I was talking to the Registered Manager one day about their need for a wheelchair-accessible swing.What do you think of Adam and Lizaposs gesture  Let us know in the comments below Emily loves the swings in the park so much, it made me feel sad that not everyone has the opportunity to have a go on them. After a bit of googling we saw these swings cost around £,. I put two and two together, and Liz and I decided that we should go for it and try to raffle off our home, enabling us to move, letting someone win an amazing prize in time for Christmas, and also raising funds for Grace House. The charity aims to enrich the lives of disabled children, young people, and their families in the local area by offering short breaks for disabled children, counselling, family activities, youth groups, and much more. Itaposs very close to our hearts.  Our beautul house in South Tyneside has three bedrooms, two storeys and a garden. Itaposs close to a big park and only eight minutes drive from the nearest beach. And you wonapost have to pay any property transport fees as thataposll all be done for you. If we sell all , raffle tickets, one lucky winner will be waking up on Christmas Day with the deeds to our house. And Grace House will be getting a £, donation for that special swing. I asked Liz for her input into this piece and she laughed: Itaposs a crazy idea to put your home up for raffle instead of just selling it the conventional way but Adam convinced me it would be a good idea. It was very important to us that we did something special with the extra money we could raise. Working in Grace House I see where the money goes and having that extra cash means we can do more for the kids and young people we have.  A wheelchair-accessible swing has been on our wish list for a while but because itaposs so expensive itaposs never been achievable but this time we could really try and get it for the kids. So what would you doyou won our house for £  Live mortgage- and rent-free  Rent it out for extra income  Sell it - or maybe be inspired by us and give it to charity  Thereaposs only one way to find out, isnapost there... To take part in Adam and Lizaposs raffle, go to Raffall for the TCs.

In a statement released by the Imperial Household Agency to mark her birthday, she said: “I would like to refine myself and move forward step by step so that I can grow into an adult who can be of service to others.”  But who exactly is Princess Aiko and what will her future hold  We take a look… Only child Princess Aiko, also known as Princess Toshi, is the only child of Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako.She was born at Tokyoaposs Imperial Palace in  and her parents broke with tradition by choosing her name rather than leaving it to her grandfather, former Emperor Akihito.Aiko is her personal name, while her imperial title Toshi means a person who respects others. School struggles Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.When she was just eight years old, Aiko refused to go to school because she said she was the victim of bullying.She was eventually persuaded toto the classroom but onlyher mother could go too. It was some time before she felt confident to go to school on her own. Aiko’s parents tried to make her school days more bearable by regularly inviting her classmates to the palace. An investigation revealed that she had suffered “violent things” from boys in another class. The school, however, explained away the incident, claiming that two boys accidentally collided with her, “which scared her”. Health problems  In October , there were more worries about the princess when she missed nearly two months from school due to an unspecied illness. Palace officials confirmed the teenager had been complaining of stomach problems and dizziness, which they attributed to studying for exams as well as practising for an athletics event. She later attended Gakushuin Girls’ Senior High School, where the princess was able to spend three months studying at Eton in Britain, staying in a boarding house. Aiko then started accompanying her parents on royal duties after her father ascended to the Chrysanthemum Throne in . She is currently enrolled at Gakushuin University, where she has been attending online classes due to the Covid pandemic.According to the Japan Times, she studies Japanese literature, English and Spanish as well as Japanese history and traditional art.In September, she moved from the Akasaka Imperial Residence to the Imperial Palace with her parents taking her dog Yuri and cats Mii and Seven with her. Entering royal le  Now she has turned , Aiko will be formally welcomed into public le in a ceremony set to take place on Sunday. While dressed in formal attire, she will visit sanctuaries where the Imperial Familyaposs ancestors are buried and offer prayers to the gods, as well as be greeted by her parents and grandparents. Part of her formal attire will be a tiara, however itaposs been reported that the one she will wear for the ceremony will be a second-hand one - and not made especially for her. The tiara she will wear was first made for her aunt Princess Sayako but it is thought that the piece is being adjusted so it fits her perfectly on her big day. Itaposs said that there was some surprise in Japan, when it was announced that no new tiara was being made for the occasion. Future le  Once her official coming-of-age ceremony is out of the way, it is believed Aikoaposs first public appearance will be on New Yearaposs Day, when members of Japanaposs Imperial Family meet with well-wishers at Tokyoaposs Imperial Palace. She will also continue her university studies and in March will appear at a traditional coming-of-age news conference. However, depending on how Aikoaposs adult le pans out, her time in Japanaposs Imperial Family could be short.Thataposs becausea female member of the Imperial Family marries a commoner, she will lose her royal status and even her title.Earlier this year, her cousin Princess Mako was forced to relinquish her title when she married her commoner long-term love Kei Komuro.Before Makoaposs wedding, there were emotional scenes when she was forced to say goodbye to her parents and younger sister Kako at the entrance to their home.Though all wore masks in line with Japanaposs coronavirus protocol, her mother could be seen blinking rapidly, asto fight off tears.Mako bowed formally to her parents but her sister grabbed her shoulders and the two shared a long embrace. Chrysanthemum Throne  Of course, Aiko may choose not to marry - but despite being the only child of the Emperor, she will not ascend to the throne because women are not allowed to rule over Japan. In Japan there are just three heirs to the throne, Emperor Naruhito’s younger brother Crown Prince Akishino, , his son Prince Hisahito, , and the emperor’s uncle Prince Hitachi, . Experts have warned the royal line could completely vanishthe Imperial House Law is not revised. In , an expert  called for a revision to the law to allow the imperial couple’s first born, regardless of gender, to ascend the throne. But this was halted with the birth of Prince Hisahito in  - the was the first male member of the Imperial Family born in nearly  years. There are also fears that banning women from marrying outside the nobility, effectively forcing them to leave the Royal Familythey chose to wed, means the busy schedule of official duties is falling onto fewer and fewer people. Relaxing the rules is popular in Japan, with  per cent of people said to be supportive of allowing women to become emperors, not least because it would keep the monarchy relevant in an ever-changing world. But Japan’s former prime minister Shinzo Abe was reportedly against allowing women to rule, believing that because the throne has consistently been passed down through the male line, it should continue the same way.

As choppy swell swirled around the surfers, the sharkaposs impressive dorsal fin can be seen breaching the wateraposs surface. It seems like man and marine monster are just feet away from one another off Middles Beach, Isabela, in Puerto Rico. Surfer Rolando Montes can be seen making a panicked bid to paddle back to the safety of the beach while his pal also tries to get away on top of his board. Stunned onlooker Jorge Benitez filmed the encounter and watched as his friends fled.  This is the first shark I see, Benitez said. Although itaposs known they are around the areas, but apparently they have enough food so we barely have incidentsany. Shark attacks in waters off Puerto Rico are rare, with the most recent incident a decade ago. Over the past nine years nearly  people have been mauled across the globe. The current hotspot is the US, where  shark bites were reported this year, compared to  in Australia. This year  shark attacks - six being fatal - have been reported across the globe. As scary as sharks may seem, the odds of dying in their jaws is very low compared to dozens of other causes. According to the World Health Organisation, ischaemic heart disease is the biggest killer and claimed . million lives in  - compared to  shark deaths that year. That means youaposre , times more likely to die due to narrowed heart arteries than in a set of ferocious aquatic gnashers. Regardless, shark attacks remain more interesting than chronic diseases in most peopleaposs eyes. Recently a huge great white shark attacked a film crewaposs boat after they tried attaching a camera to one of the predatoraposs fins. The Discovery Channel camera crew were on location off Stewart Island in New Zealand when the shark burst out of the water and tried to sink its razor teeth into their dinghy. Before the attack the film crew tried to latch a camera to a fin in the hopes of seeing the apex predatoraposs feeding ground. Within moments the shark darted at the vessel and rushed up out of the water and bit down on a rope attaching them to a larger vessel. The narrator can be heard warning of the dangersthe crew are separated from the main ship.

which swung in either direction in horrendous conditions.The sides exchanged goals in the first half, with Stuart MacLean reacting quickest in the box after the Baljaffray keeper couldn’t hold a Fraser Talbot shot and the striker scored to net his eleventh goal in eight games.Baljaffray forced a succession of corners near the end of the half and were on level terms when Red Star were only able to partially clear a corner which fell to the away side’s full back and his shot via the aid of a deflection went past young Leon Murphy in the Star goal. -Into the second half and Star could have retaken the lead when Aaron Moore latched onto a drilled cross from strike partner Stuart MacLean, however, his effort was blocked by an excellent save from the Baljaffray number one.The visitors took the lead after  minutes when a cross caused confusion in the Star defence and the Baljaffray forward had the simple task of finishing into an empty net from close range.Star huffed and puffed for an equaliser, however, they were frustrated by excellent goalkeeping until the goal came in fortuitous circumstances after a long ball was nodded past his own keeper by the Baljaffray centre back meaning the sides were level with  minutes to go.Star took the lead with five minutes remaining when Aaron Moore was able to burst clear of the Baljaffray backline and finish well into the far corner to make it -.This should have been enough to see Star over the line but Baljaffray scrambled a late equaliser when Star again failed to clear a free kick and the ball was bundled over the line to see the match end -.Lochgilphead Red Star are on their travels on Saturday November  when they face their toughest test of the season so far as they take on league leaders and title favourites

delivery by Craig Aitken.The visitors doubled their lead after  minutes when Craig Aitken broke clear down the left and finished with an excellent effort into the goalkeeper’s far corner to put Star - ahead.Star were under pressure for much of the remainder of the half but always carried a threat on the break, with Stuart MacLean’s pace causing the home side no end of problems.Into the second half, Arthurlie forced their way back into the match and pulled a goal back after a rare defensive lapse by Star on  minutes. Star failed to clear the danger from a cross and the unfortunate Coll McCallum erted into his own net past Leon Murphy.The Arthurlie equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when winger Sean Ross cut inside before unleashing a spectacular effort into the top corner.The hosts would have been expected to go on and win the game from here but the Star defence remained well-organised and resolute and a fine goalkeeping performance from Leon Murphy ensured the Lochgilphead side ed home with a well-earned point.Star put their unbeaten league record on the line on Saturday November  when they welcome fellow Argyll side Cardross to the Joint Campus G.

suggest that illness caused by the Omicron iant is more severe.However, the first minister said this remained under reviewAlthough the first minister couldnt provide a detailed updated on the figures

Alongside eating berries, they also feed on small insects and mealworms.Unlike other members of the thrush family which build nests in the trees, redwings prefer to build their cup-shaped nests on the ground.The nest is usually well hidden in the dense vegetation and made out of grass, mosses and twigs.Most redwings breed in Scandinavia and Iceland, with a small number breeding in the UK, most of which are concentrated in the Scottish Highlands. The population arriving here from Iceland appears slightly darker and bigger and it is treated as the distinct subspecies coburni.Unlike many migratory birds, which remain loyal to their wintering grounds, redwings present a nomadic lestyle ndash driven by food availability, they rarelyto the same place.I have already seen my first redwings in Edinburgh but I am yet to find them in East Lothian this autumn.Last winter in Musselburgh was fabulous! I particularly remember the snowfall in January during a couple of days I took off work. I liked every minute and, despite cold hands and feet, I enjoyed walking along the Esk.At one point, I spotted a buzzard perching on a snowy branchand headed towards it.As soon as I captured the bird of prey, I heard a familiar lsquotseeprsquo call coming from the hedges.I knew the redwings must have been having a lavish meal as the call was getting louder with every step I took, but I could not see them.It amazes me how dficult it is to spot these birds, even though they are medium-sized and always in large groups.I managed to sneak inside the bush and, when I looked up, I saw at least  redwings. The birds were incredibly noisy and constantly on the move. The whole bush was bustling and I felt like I was sitting at the heart of a busy factory!Until now, I found that experience one of the most challenging. It was not easy to operate the camera in such a tight space, with twigs scratching my face the entire time. I did not have a clear view of the birds either, but I could not move as it would spook them!The low winter sun was already disappearing but, eventually, I did manage to find a gap and push the camera through. After taking a few photographs, I decided to head back home.When I ed to the same spot the following day, the redwings were gone.If you have enjoyed my pictures this year and would like to see more, I now have several designs of my WildleCalendars for sale.

It is one that continues to inform us and inspire us.It changed the course of industrial relations for good.After the loss-making Upper Clyde Shipbuilders went into receivership, threatening thousands of jobs, workers at the consortiumrsquos four yards at Govan, Linthouse, Scotstoun and Clydebank occupied the facilities.But rather than withdrawing their labour, they continued working to prove the viability of shipbuilding on the upper Clyde ndash and ended up being more productive than the yards had been under private ownership.Jimmy Cloughley, a former member of the UCS co-ordinating committee said: ldquoIt was a victory against the Tories, and instead of the pound million required to keep the contracts going, after the volte-face, they ended up with between seven and nine million.Their action garnered huge support from across the labour movement as well as civil society, the world of celebrity and even small businesses.Lead union conveners Jimmy Reid and Jimmy Airlie became household names.Along with Sammy Barr, the boilermakersrsquo convener who first suggested the work-in tactic, both Reid and Airlie were members of the Communist Party ndash which at the time wielded huge influence across Britainrsquos labour movement.Reidrsquos daughter Eileen was present at the reception, as were Barrrsquos daughters June and Brenda.When it was announced at a shop stewardsrsquo committee meeting that Lennon and Yoko Ono had made a substantial donation to the cause, one of the union reps responded: ldquoDonrsquot be daft, Leninrsquos been dead for years.The workforce rejected a compromise offered by Ted Heathrsquos Conservative government, which would see just two of the four yards stay open.By fighting on, they secured the continued operation of all of the yards and Reid was elected rector of Glasgow University during the dispute.George Kerr, a veteran of the work-in, told The Herald: ldquoSince Covid, more and more jobs are in jeopardy. Where we can celebrate [the victory at UCS] like tonight, it should inspire people in similar circumstances. We can remember how it can be done and how it should be done.ldquoWorkers are more isolated now from the collective action to defend the right to work.ldquoUCS took up momentum: everybody realised they were affected, and they got involved. The shopkeepers knew thatthere were no shipyards, they would go out of business.UCS was also a signicant turning point in union democracy and communication techniques, with mass meetings and daily work-in bulletins keeping workers informed of every development. ldquoWe didnrsquot have mobile phones in those days, work-in veteran Davie Torrance said. at yesterdayrsquos gathering.The new badge is designed by Bob Starrett, a shipyard painter who became the official cartoonist of the UCS shop stewardsrsquo committee. His illustrations for the unionrsquos leaflets are considered to have played a major role in keeping the workforce informed of developments.ldquoThey liked the idea they were consulted, their vote counted, Starrett said of the UCS workers. ldquoThe labour force, hundred per cent behind [the actions of the shop stewards], therefore you could call on other industries for support. Nobody was pulling a strop, nobody was going to use it as a springboard to advance theirself. The whole of Britain came behind. Somebody has to be the spearhead, and it happened to be Glasgow.The event was organised by the Unite unionrsquos West of Scotland community branch - which organises among retired and unemployed workers. Branch secretary Jim Lister said: ldquoThe strategy of bringing support for the struggle for a decent le from all sections of society was the foundation on which the success of the work-in was built.ldquoAn alliance of small businesses, faith groups, councils and members across the political spectrum all stood together with trade unionists calling for the simplest of demands: the lsquoright to workrsquo."},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive accessas we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive pound for two months offer here.From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expectground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content ndash as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just pound for two monthshere.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as ldquounsatisfactory on pollution, according to data from the ScottishEnvironmentProtection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oilcompanies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as ldquovery poor in .

The forecasting ides the road network into inidual routes rather than geographic areas making it easier for decision makers to direct resources where they are needed most.#Each island is designated as a route, while the Mainland is ided into eight routes. Up until this year, the decision on how, and when, to treat the road network in the winter months has relied upon the information received from two weather stations at the Mill of Rango in Sandwick and at Kirkwall Airport, basically covering the East and West, while this has been helpful, it was a very broad brush.“The system is being closely monitored by officers throughout the winter season with view to summarise its performance at the conclusion of the trial next year. This will determinewe want to adopt this technology on a permanent basis.”Stressing that road safety remains the top priority, she said:“I want to reassure our communities thatwe are treating areas of the West Mainland, but not parts of the East for example, we are doing this because we are confident – based on the data – that the roads in the East do not require it.”There are km of priority one roads in Orkney, km of priority two routes and km of priority three roads.In line with nationally recommended guidance, the council’s Winter Service Policy - points out that the network will be treated in the morning when road surface temperatures are predicted to be below C, and in the afternoon when they are predicted to be below C.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are still hoping for the best and hoping that our developing understanding of this iant will reduce rather than increase our concern.“I very much hope that additional protections can be avoided and while we will act on a precautionary basis, we will always seek to act out at all times in a proportionate manner.”Research is still being undertaken on the Omicron iant — which was first discovered in southern Africa — but early indications are that it might be more transmissible than the dominant Deltra strain.However, she did say that there was no evidence that the symptoms of Omicron was dferent from Delta and the disease caused is any dferent.Scientists are also working to establish what impact this new iant will have on the effectiveness of vaccines.New recommendations are set to come from the joint committee on vaccination and immunisationis set to be announced this afternoon, and this will guide the Scottish Government on the shape of the booster programme.Ms Sturgeon said that evencurrent vaccines were less effective against the new iant, that was not the same as no effectiveness, and urged more people to come forward and become double vaccinated.She also urged travel restrictions to be tightened and called on a four nations approach in order to prevent the importation of the virus from abroad.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As the trust’s chairman Dan Wise explained, it is essentially an underwater drone.He said: “This small unit will allow us to continue our collaborative research into the Orkney skate population. More specically, we will be able to get eyes underwater to look for essential fish habitat such as egg case laying grounds, nursery areas etc.“We can cover more ground with this drone when compared to ing, and the quality of the camera is greater when compared to a drop down camera – both survey styles we still do but this is another tool in the tool box.”RSPB Scotland is also going to invest in new machinery, with its £, award going to the purchase of a specialist tractor for removing vegetation.A tractor equipped with Soucy tracks will be used to cut and collect material for removal from the sites, without leaving rutted tracks or creating erosion points. This machine has signicantly less ground pressure than a normal tractor, reducing the chances of damaging sensitive habitats, and is specically designed to operate in softer ground conditions.The benefits to birdle include opening up foraging habitat, allowing flightless chicks to move around more easily, and reducing the chance of chicks becoming saturated in dense, wet vegetation.RSPB Scotland site manager in Orkney, Alan Leitch, said:“The funding means we can purchase machinery that offers us a real opportunity to upscale our annual land management efforts on the Orkney nature reserves to increase conservation benefits. These operations will help a suite of species including curlews, lapwings, and hen harriers.”The £m fund was launched in July this year and has now been extended to a total of at least £m over the next five years. On the fund in general, the Bioersity Minister, Lorna Slater, said:“Too much of Scotland’s natural environment is degraded after years of over-exploitation, but this government is committed to restoring nature and our wildle. The Nature Restoration Fund will play a big role in delivering these aspirations, and the projects we are funding today are just the beginning.#The fund kick starts a new approach, supporting longer-term, larger, landscape-scale projects across Scotland # on land and at sea # that address the twin crises of bioersity loss and climate change.

Although folk must still enter via the south nave side door, once inside the cathedral, everyone will be able to enjoy the new glazed timber vestibule.Meredith Macbeth, St Magnus Cathedral#s historical buildings conservator, said: “We are absolutely delighted with the work so far and the new vestibule truly enhances the entryway of this wonderful building. The works are not entirely complete as the curved glass has been delayed by the supplier in Europe due to COVID, Brexit and other supply issues, but we are expecting it early . So for now the area will remain roped off from the public, but it is a delight to see the new vestibule settling in and the excited response by those who know the building so well.”Councillor Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC#s education, leisure and housing committee, said: “The cathedral really is the gt that keeps on giving to the people of Orkney and further afield.#What a beautul addition to what is a very special building. I look forward to seeing the complete, finished product which is sure to be absolutely stunning.”Elaine Grieve from the Society of the Friends of St Magnus Cathedral, who are making a substantial contribution to the costs of the work, said: “The Cathedral is so precious that it is hard to contemplate making any changes for fear they won’t do the building justice.#However, in this case, what an absolutely wonderful transformation the vestibule has made to the entrance of the building. The craftmanship is outstanding and we now have an addition which befits this treasured building loved by so many near and far.”The cathedral#s stonework also enjoyed a facelt recently.Conservation works included repointing stonework with lime mortar on the interior and exterior of the west door. Samples of original lime mortars were found deep in the constructions joints of the building and were analysed by the Scottish Lime Centre in Fe. An appropriate mix was specied, to match in manner of strength, colour and aggregate size.For anyone wishing to visit there are signs directly through the side gate, please be mindful of the restrictions in place in regards to the pandemic such as the wearing of masks and social distancing while inside.St Magnus Cathedral is managed by OIC on behalf of the people of Orkney.

I would like to thank the Secretary of State for Defence, Ben Wallace, for his ongoing commitment to servicewomen and veterans.ldquoOur inquiry discovered that six out of ten women who had experienced abuse, did not complain for fear of the impact it would have on their career, or because they thought nothing would be done.ldquoThe fact that a servicewoman can now make a sexual complaint safe in the knowledge that her direct Chain of Command wonrsquot be handling it is a huge step forward.ldquoThere is also set to be a more robust process for handling complaints of Bullying, Harassment and Discrimination ndash although questions remain over what this means in practice.

It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CoGCGraduation_AlainaMaclennan_PrizeWinner-2-scaled.jpg","title":"skye graduate wins college","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe HND Sports Coaching graduate celebrated at the college’s ceremony held on Mondayin the city’s Royal Concert Hall. Alaina, who attended Plockton High School, and lives in Kyleakin, was surprised and delighted to win the prize, saying: #I am happy that my hard work during my time at college, and through the challenges of adapting to remote learning due to Covid-, have paid off.  “City of Glasgow College gave me the good foundation I needed to build and develop my future career in sports coaching.

However, the service and sacrice of all those who fought in the First World War continues to be remembered,” Sir Jeffrey said.“There is also a growing recognition that those who fought came from dferent backgrounds, but were in the trenches with a united goal. The war truly is part of our shared history and it is fitting that so many have travelled from Northern Ireland to mark the centenary of the tower.”Sir Jeffrey also paid tribute to the Somme Association for ensuring the Ulster Tower and Thiepval Wood are maintained to commemorate the past and keep those stories alive for future generations.

More detail later.— Pat Finucane CentreDecember , “There was a third injury to the top of the skull, perhaps caused by a fall or perhaps caused by a missile.”Mr McCrisken said the scene was likely to have been “fast paced, frenzied and chaotic”.He added: “At least two, and probably more than two, rubber batons were discharged striking at least two people.“I am not persuaded based upon the evidence that I have heard that Thomas Friel was struck with a rubber baton round. It is of course possible that he may have been, but I do not consider this as the most likely scenario based on the evidence which I have heard.”He said it did seem to have been considered by police that Mr Friel had been present and injured at an earlier altercation, describing a “glaring inconsistency in timings”, with a rubber bullet having been fired at .am, after an ambulance had been called for Mr Friel at .am.“No further investigative leads were suggested to resolve this issue, the RUC did not, it seems, have access to the military logs and sought no access,” he said, adding he relied on “crucial evidence” from four forensic pathologists.The coroner described a local background of “savage violence” as “essential to understand what happened”, and recalled a very dferent background to now, with  people losing their lives in  in the Troubles.“The passage of such a period of time is bound to have affected the recollections of those who witnessed and participated in the events of the tragic night of - May  … it is not possible to overestimate the dficulty in relying on sworn testimony and a search for the truth at a remove of  years from the event to which it relates,” he said.He described being left with the impression that former soldiers who gave evidence had poor recall but were “trying their best to help the inquest but genuinely and understandably found it dficult to remember these events”.One of Mr Friel’s surviving brothers was present as the findings were read by Mr McCrisken.The coroner recognised the “resolve and determination” of the Friel family, waiting almost  years for a fresh inquest into Mr Friel’s death, with his sister Margaret having died before the hearings started.“I hope that these findings provide some measure of closure. Justice of course can mean dferent things to dferent people, but in terms of these so-called legacy inquests, it should, in my opinion, mean answers,” he said.He added: “Thomas Friel was clearly a man much loved by his family … Liam Friel, his younger brother, told me at inquest that Thomas would have helped anyone. Clearly his loss was felt very deeply by the family and that remains the case, and the disputed circumstances of his death has only added to that grief.“Liam Friel told me at inquest that the family wanted justice for Thomas after all these years. Liam told me that he believes Thomas was struck by a rubber baton round and that this caused his death. My findings are therefore not what Liam was expecting.“I believe that justice in the context of an inquest administered fairly means answers to certain questions concerning the death of a person.“Each issue considered during this inquest was forensically examined in a degree of detail that was simply not possible  years ago.“Thousands of pages of evidence were considered and oral evidence taken from  witnesses with evidence read from many others, experts in ballistics, forensic pathology were examined for many hours and I consider that the family have been treated justly, fairly and reasonably.“They in turn have shown great patience and have themselves behaved in a fair and respectful manner. I urge them to consider these findings and trust that when they do they will consider that justice has indeed been done and answers have been provided explaining finally the circumstances around the death of Thomas Friel.”A lawyer for Mr Friel’s family, who long campaigned for a fresh inquest, said they are “shocked and disappointed” by the findings.Ruairi Muldoon told the BBC: “The family has always been convinced that he died as a result of a blow to the head by a rubber bullet fired at short range.”Most ReadSammy Wilson slammed for ‘distasteful ding dong’ tweet as DUP MPs vote against rules to combat Omicron in EnglandThomas Garfield Gilmour: Only man convicted of sectarian killing of three Quinn brothers dies suddenlyLegal first in NI after Co Down man convicted of publishing photo of judge sitting in courtDeaths of Russell McAfee and Nigel McGraw leave Coleraine community stunned – they were ‘best mates who got on with everyone’Jeffrey Epstein’s ‘Lolita Express’ jet made stops in Belfast, Dublin and ShannonTop VideosPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayVideo: Middle class madam Anglea Cosgrave - brothel queen behind one of Northern Ireland’s biggest prostitution ringsLatest Northern IrelandAgreement on protocol before Christmas is ‘unrealistic’, Simon Coveney saysNorthern Ireland pupils set to go part-time to cope with absent staffArtist knocked out by former prisoner’s boxing star paintingsProbe call as it’s revealed  patients died after contracting Covid in South Eastern Trust hospitalsTurner Prize winner announced after collectives dominate shortlistLatestMinistry of Defence sets target of doubling female recruits by Voters go to the polls in Old Bexley and Sidcup by-electionAppeal court to rule on latest round of Meghan privacy battle against newspaperStudent who sews sanitary pads for refugees now leads , volunteersUlster Rugby Round Up: Finally breaking our Leinster hoodoo and newfound back row riches,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

PAIn conclusion, the wide-ranging report stated the FICT commission was tasked to look at the aspects of cultural identity that “unite us and ide us”.The commission’s work over the last number of years, has led it to conclude that while, yes, we do share much culture in common with each other, we clearly have a set of political and cultural identities, which continue to provide challenges for our society,” it outlined.In its programme of consultation and engagement, the commission heard of a range of issues that continue to cause tension and ision within our society.The recommendations made in this report are based on creating an enabling environment in which expressions of everyone’s cultural identity in the public space are both respected and respectful.The commission believes that the implementation of its recommendations will develop a new enabling environment in which cultural expression can flourish, free from paramilitary influence and in a new arena of lawfulness and respect.Ultimately the Commission believes that the implementation of our recommendations will be for the common good of everyone within our society.”Read the full document here: https:www.executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk publications commission-flags-identity-culture-and-tradition-final-reportRelated topicsNorthern Ireland AssemblyThe Executive OfficePaul GivanMichelle O#NeillMore On Northern Ireland AssemblyWhat are the key points from the  recommendations included in the flags and culture reportNew flag for Northern Ireland and bonfire enforcement among FICT report recommendationsCalls for Stormont’s Communities Department to set up support scheme for those impacted by rising energy costs PremiumNorthern Ireland will find it challenging to fund another lockdown: economistRevealed: £m cost of air pollution to NI health service and new diseases it will causeMost ReadSammy Wilson slammed for ‘distasteful ding dong’ tweet as DUP MPs vote against rules to combat Omicron in EnglandThomas Garfield Gilmour: Only man convicted of sectarian killing of three Quinn brothers dies suddenlyLegal first in NI after Co Down man convicted of publishing photo of judge sitting in courtDeaths of Russell McAfee and Nigel McGraw leave Coleraine community stunned – they were ‘best mates who got on with everyone’Jeffrey Epstein’s ‘Lolita Express’ jet made stops in Belfast, Dublin and ShannonTop VideosPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayVideo: Middle class madam Anglea Cosgrave - brothel queen behind one of Northern Ireland’s biggest prostitution ringsLatest Northern IrelandAgreement on protocol before Christmas is ‘unrealistic’, Simon Coveney saysNorthern Ireland pupils set to go part-time to cope with absent staffProbe call as it’s revealed  patients died after contracting Covid in South Eastern Trust hospitalsArtist knocked out by former prisoner’s boxing star paintingsTurner Prize winner announced after collectives dominate shortlistLatestMinistry of Defence sets target of doubling female recruits by Voters go to the polls in Old Bexley and Sidcup by-electionAppeal court to rule on latest round of Meghan privacy battle against newspaperStudent who sews sanitary pads for refugees now leads , volunteersUlster Rugby Round Up: Finally breaking our Leinster hoodoo and newfound back row riches,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Unable to even mark the Duke of Edinburgh’s passing in the same way as other countries.“Such cultural and identity weaponisation will make solutions very dficult to come by as some want cultural domination rather than respect.”He also backed the FICT report’s conclusion that paramilitary flags and murals should not be displayed.Mr Kelly said the five main political parties were involved in producing the report.He claimed the DUP was “unwilling to confront sectarianism” associated with flying flags at hospitals, schools, places of worship, interfaces and mixed housing developments.“And it has chosen to support those engaged in intimidation and anti-social behaviour at [contentious] bonfires which have no regard for the protection of people, property or the environment,” added Mr Kelly.“Progress in tackling sectarianism in this society will be made in spite of the DUP’s efforts to deny rights and equality.”Meanwhile, SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said it was a “disgrace” that an implementation plan has not been developed -  months after the Executive was first shown the FICT report.“This report has cost £, to produce and there’s no actual plan at all to bring forward any of the recommendations and here’s why - the Executive Office, the two principal parties, can’t agree - now there’s a surprise,” she stated.“They can’t agree on a way forward. We know this isn#t easy and that is why the commission was set up in the first place.“It was to deal with the contentious issues that surround flags and emblems in our communities, and after five long years, and after sitting on a report for  months, they are publishing it today without a plan to move forward.”Green Party NI leader Claire Bailey MLA said the FICT report “saga” is the latest example of the five-party Executive’s “failure” to govern.“I’m glad it has now finally been published, but disappointingly there’s no agreed plan to implement any of its recommendations,” she continued.“What’s the point in spending hundreds of thousands on a reportit’s not acted on “Whilst on the ground, grassroots leadership has made progress, the Executive parties have failed to provide meaningful political leadership on these issues.“Contentious issues around flags, bonfires and cultural expression in Northern Ireland will continue to provoke isive debate for as long as the Executive parties fail to agree on a way forward.“The FICT report provides the framework for developing future legislation and policy around these issues.”TUV leader Jim Allister described the report as a “complete waste of time” and a “colossal” waste of money.“That said, it is already clear that some within the media are intent on using the ideas which the report says were discussed but not agreed - such as the preposterous suggestion that the Irish tricolour would be given parity on buildings - as the basis to frame public debate,” he stated. “Therein lies the real danger of the report.“Discredited ideas, such as a shared day of reflection where innocent victims would supposedly be remembered alongside victim makers, have similarly been given a new lease of le not because they were agreed but because the report says they were discussed.“The report doesn’t event mention some of the issues which innocent victims find most offensive, such as the continued practice of paramilitary-style funerals.“For all the talk of the lack of an action or implementation plan the truth is there appears to be very little in this document around which there was agreement and hence little to implement.”Related topicsGreen PartySDLPSinn FéinSinead McLaughlinChristopher StalfordClare BaileyTraditional Unionist VoiceJim AllisterMost ReadSammy Wilson slammed for ‘distasteful ding dong’ tweet as DUP MPs vote against rules to combat Omicron in EnglandThomas Garfield Gilmour: Only man convicted of sectarian killing of three Quinn brothers dies suddenlyLegal first in NI after Co Down man convicted of publishing photo of judge sitting in courtDeaths of Russell McAfee and Nigel McGraw leave Coleraine community stunned – they were ‘best mates who got on with everyone’Jeffrey Epstein’s ‘Lolita Express’ jet made stops in Belfast, Dublin and ShannonTop VideosPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayVideo: Middle class madam Anglea Cosgrave - brothel queen behind one of Northern Ireland’s biggest prostitution ringsLatest Northern IrelandAgreement on protocol before Christmas is ‘unrealistic’, Simon Coveney saysNorthern Ireland pupils set to go part-time to cope with absent staffArtist knocked out by former prisoner’s boxing star paintingsProbe call as it’s revealed  patients died after contracting Covid in South Eastern Trust hospitalsTurner Prize winner announced after collectives dominate shortlistLatestMinistry of Defence sets target of doubling female recruits by Voters go to the polls in Old Bexley and Sidcup by-electionAppeal court to rule on latest round of Meghan privacy battle against newspaperStudent who sews sanitary pads for refugees now leads , volunteersUlster Rugby Round Up: Finally breaking our Leinster hoodoo and newfound back row riches,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Today, he is in Palmyra, one of the last Isis strongholds on the east of Syria near Iraq to fall.Read MoreNorthern Ireland’s most intrepid traveller gives his survival guide for roaming the worldLebanon will follow Syria — all part of what David says is the riskiest leg of his adventure so far.

Speaking from Syria, David said his thorough research ensures that he always feels safe. There are countless checkpoints which might make it sound otherwise but these have been permanent fixtures since the civil war and are an effective way for the government to show control. It really takes to have travelled around the Middle East to understand this is just how it is, a way of le.”And just as Northern Ireland people became inured to the tragedy going on around them during the Troubles, Syrian people were much the same, David says.“We’ve had our own issues with conflicts at home in Northern Ireland but rarely do we bat an eyelid, and the people here have a similar mentality,” he added.How these people hold themselves, how they are so welcoming and the warmth they continue to show after going through one of the worst atrocities of our generation, it’s something that humbles me, a huge reason why I visit these places.”He adds: “The biggest security risk will be my trip around Idlib, an area still controlled by the rebels not far from Aleppo.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDavid Simpson in Cape Town, South Africa FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDavid Simpson in Cape Town, South AfricaAlso, a trip to Palmyra can only be confirmed at the last minute, depending on the activity in these areas and whether it is safe to do so.”The pandemic means that travel plans can be thrown into chaos at the last minute — as we saw when the emergence of the Omicron iant of coronavirus upended travel from South Africa.But seasoned traveller David has got a detailed itinerary planned. Next, he intends to take in West Africa, followed by some silverback gorilla trekking in Uganda and driving theof the Serengeti for the Great Migration.A more sedate pace awaits when he spends two weeks driving from Normandy to Belgium on a war history tour, while luxury is ahead on a trip to the Seychelles.David, who writes about his travels at www.djjsimpson and has an Instagram account, djjsimpson, takes the challenge of visiting some of the world’s most troubled territories in his stride after falling in love with travel as a student.“I went to university in Glasgow where my interest in seeing more of the world was ignited. I began travelling and being part of new cultures but it wasn’t until I was in New Zealand where I counted the countries I had already visited and was shocked by how many more there was to see,” he explained.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDavid at the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, Moscow FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDavid at the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, Moscow“This was the first time I had the idea of continuing my travelling to corners of the world I had never heard of let alone planned to visit. I do expect this next year to be a bit more challenging but nothing I won’t be able to overcome, as I have already been in some situations that, for many, could be off-putting.”Ordeals like a five-hour interrogation from police in Algeria, being subjected to a strip-search before boarding a flight to Israel and being held at gunpoint in Austin, Texas, haven’t put him off.“These negative accounts all become positive learning experiences in the end and are far outweighed by the many great adventures I get to see.“Some of the most controversial places I have visited have been the most eye-opening and friendliest, for example, my last trip before the pandemic was to Sudan, a country many believe to be entirely unsafe but the people there turned out to be some of the friendliest I’ve met to date.“Quite often it is these places that surprise you the most. Countries that pose a security risk just require more research and planning. You may pay a little extra for the privilege but it’s all worth it.”David has taken all precautions for his upcoming travel expeditions including completing testing, investigating testing stations abroad and ensuring his Covid- vaccination and visa requirements are up to date.Despite ensuring all his documents are in order, he still anticipates challenges.“It’s inevitable when you are trying to visit the far corners of the earth that you will come into dficulty. That’s why, for me, it’s important to have a plan b, but who can plan for something like coronavirus “I recently visited the Caribbean and it actually proved to be a logistical nightmare with arranging PCR tests and arrival forms, not the way the Caribbean should be enjoyed. It’s safe to sayI thought the challenge of visiting every country was dficult before Covid then now it’s an entirely new level.”David believes he is in a demographic of no more than  people who have visited every country in the world and is, so far, the first Northern Ireland person to take on the challenge.And the very detail of deciding how many countries there are to visit is part of the process. “The community of which I am a part of focuses on several lists of countries,” he says.One is the UN list of  as well as the others such as FIFA, The Olympics and also disputed territories. When I eventually complete this goal I didn#t want to be in any doubt that I hadn#t visited somewhere which should have been included so hence my list being slightly longer and more thorough.“I also didn#t want to just choose the shortest list of  for the sake of completing this as soon as possible.”Most ReadSammy Wilson slammed for ‘distasteful ding dong’ tweet as DUP MPs vote against rules to combat Omicron in EnglandThomas Garfield Gilmour: Only man convicted of sectarian killing of three Quinn brothers dies suddenlyLegal first in NI after Co Down man convicted of publishing photo of judge sitting in courtDeaths of Russell McAfee and Nigel McGraw leave Coleraine community stunned – they were ‘best mates who got on with everyone’Jeffrey Epstein’s ‘Lolita Express’ jet made stops in Belfast, Dublin and ShannonTop VideosPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayVideo: Middle class madam Anglea Cosgrave - brothel queen behind one of Northern Ireland’s biggest prostitution ringsLatest Northern IrelandAgreement on protocol before Christmas is ‘unrealistic’, Simon Coveney saysNorthern Ireland pupils set to go part-time to cope with absent staffArtist knocked out by former prisoner’s boxing star paintingsProbe call as it’s revealed  patients died after contracting Covid in South Eastern Trust hospitalsTurner Prize winner announced after collectives dominate shortlistLatestMinistry of Defence sets target of doubling female recruits by Voters go to the polls in Old Bexley and Sidcup by-electionAppeal court to rule on latest round of Meghan privacy battle against newspaperStudent who sews sanitary pads for refugees now leads , volunteersUlster Rugby Round Up: Finally breaking our Leinster hoodoo and newfound back row riches,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: PAMark BainTwitterEmailDecember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailPupils and parents have been warned to prepare for part-time education in the new year as schools try to cope with staff shortages due to Covid-related absences.And the principal of a Co Down post primary school has said the current staffing crisis in schools has become a serious “health and safety” matter.St Malachy’s High School in Castlewellan has written to parents informing them that children will be facing some time out of class from January unless the situation improves.Many other schools are already working a system where year groups are sent home when no teachers are available, with over , staff off through Covid-related issues across Northern Ireland, and the number growing every day. Unions have called for the Executive to consider early closure before Christmas to alleviate pressure.The Department of Education has dismissed closing early ahead of the holidays, and the UK Government on Wednesday took the unusual step of also rejecting the suggestion from a NASUWT union official in Northern Ireland.When asked whether schools in England will be kept open until the Christmas break, Children’s Minister Will Quince told the Commons Education Committee: “That is certainly our plan and we want to see schools stay open.”St Malachy’s High School informed parents on Wednesday that the decision had been taken to plan for students to attend on a rotational basis in the new year.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Principal Orla O’Neill informed parents: “We in St Malachy’s have reached a point where staff absence is becoming a health and safety concern as the number of staff absent is increasing day by day. Today we have  teachers off. That equates to a quarter of our teaching staff.“Like all schools we have tried in earnest to secure substitute teachers to fill these positions to no avail. We have on several occasions, contacted over  subs on a given day to try to secure cover.“I have discussed the situation with the chair of Governors and we feel that we may have to go down the route that other post primaries are taking and ask that certain year groups stay at home on certain days.“We will be putting a plan in place in the new year. This is certainly not something we want to do and we have worked hard to avoid this so far this term but the situation is such that the measures we have in place are not sustainable with the current level of absence.”Helena Macormac, director of the National Association of Head Teachers, said contingency plans need to be in place, but we do not want to see a circuit breaker”. We would prefer itthat could be avoided, but safety has to be paramount. Be prepared is what we’re saying, but we really don’t want this to happen,” she added.But she added that “ there are not the substitute teachers in the system, then schools cannot open safely.”The Department of Education said: “There are no plans to close schools early for the Christmas period. Any decision to do so would be taken by the Executive and would be based on medical and scientic advice. We all know that the best place for children in terms of mental health, wellbeing and education is in school.”The Department said it “is aware of the pressures schools have been facing throughout the pandemic and the dficulties faced by some schools in securing appropriate cover as a result of staff absence”. We are actively considering how best to support schools in responding to the issues they currently face and are liaising with Department of Health colleagues while continuing to follow medical and scientic advice.”Related topicsThe Executive OfficeDepartment of EducationMore On The Executive Office PremiumAllison MorrisOpinionPointless fence-sitting exercise is a waste of five years and £kFlags report: Paramilitary flags and murals should not be displayed in Northern IrelandNew flag for Northern Ireland and bonfire enforcement among FICT report recommendations PremiumAnger of pub and bar owners as they blast Stormont for a lack of guidance over Covid certicate scheme PremiumLindy McDowellOpinionThe Covidiots who gurn about losing their liberty curtail it for the rest of usMost ReadSammy Wilson slammed for ‘distasteful ding dong’ tweet as DUP MPs vote against rules to combat Omicron in EnglandThomas Garfield Gilmour: Only man convicted of sectarian killing of three Quinn brothers dies suddenlyLegal first in NI after Co Down man convicted of publishing photo of judge sitting in courtDeaths of Russell McAfee and Nigel McGraw leave Coleraine community stunned – they were ‘best mates who got on with everyone’Jeffrey Epstein’s ‘Lolita Express’ jet made stops in Belfast, Dublin and ShannonTop VideosPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayVideo: Middle class madam Anglea Cosgrave - brothel queen behind one of Northern Ireland’s biggest prostitution ringsLatest Northern IrelandAgreement on protocol before Christmas is ‘unrealistic’, Simon Coveney saysProbe call as it’s revealed  patients died after contracting Covid in South Eastern Trust hospitalsArtist knocked out by former prisoner’s boxing star paintingsTurner Prize winner announced after collectives dominate shortlistEnniskillen building site machinery set alight in ‘possible arson’, resulting in £k worth of damageLatestMinistry of Defence sets target of doubling female recruits by Voters go to the polls in Old Bexley and Sidcup by-electionAppeal court to rule on latest round of Meghan privacy battle against newspaperStudent who sews sanitary pads for refugees now leads , volunteersUlster Rugby Round Up: Finally breaking our Leinster hoodoo and newfound back row riches,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I hope that this is the beginning of a new era of accountability for the military.”However, she called the MoD’s decision to dismiss the sub-committee’s recommendation on military courts “disappointing”, adding there was “clear evidence that the current system is failing to deliver justice”.

It opened earlier this week and seeks to gain insights from stakeholders and the wider public on the best way to shape and develop the rail network across Ireland. Mr Durkan has encouraged local people and businesses to have their say by responding to the consultation. He said: “This public consultation is an exciting opportunity for everyone to have their say on the future of rail provision across Ireland. “This island once had a thriving railway network and since coming into office SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has committed to exploring an expanded railway network, which has the potential to be transformative for communities across our island. “The benefits of an overhaul of our current railway network are clear, it would allow us to address the regional imbalances that exist across the island, making our communities better connected and making rail a real option for people who regularly travel for work, to visit friends and family and to socialise. “It would also bring a boost for our economy, with poor public transport links regularly cited as a reason for the lack of investment outside our population centres. “More public transport options would also take more cars off our roads, which is a key part of plans to tackle the climate crisis and protect our environment. “I welcome SDLP Minister Mallon’s work on progressing this project so far and hope this public consultation marks the next step in making the revolution of our island’s rail network a reality. “I know this an issue many people in Derry feel very passionate about and would urge them not to miss this unique opportunity to give their view. “While other political parties are busy politicking, the SDLP is focused on delivering for people. After almost  years of Sinn Feacutein-DUP joint Government, the public deserve delivery.

The survey found Northern Ireland to be the most charitable UK region, with more than three-quartersagreeing that it is better to give gts than to receive them. Eileen Wilson, Food Services Manager at Footprints, Northern Ireland, a partner of national food distribution charityFareSharesaid: “Christmas does bring extra challenges for people close to poverty or struggling with mental health. “Expenses go up this time of year. Not just trying to buy food and gts, but also heating in winter.” A campaign organised by the Big Give and backed by celebrities such as Stephen Fry, Dame Judi Dench, Russell Brandand others is aiming to help. The Big Give Christmas Challenge is the UK’s biggest Christmas coordinated fundraising appeal, supporting over  charities to raise funds with the unique offer of matching any donations made during the week of November  to December . This gives thehundreds of participating charities the opportunity to have their donations doubled. Alex Day, Director of The Big Give said: “Our study shows that, sadly, people across Great Britain and Northern Ireland are facing an imperfect storm high fuel prices, chronic mental health problems, rising debt, loneliness and fears about Covid- will mean that, for many, this festive period will be a far cry from picture perfect scenes portrayed on Christmas cards. “Some will rely on charities which will be further and further stretched as demand grows. “That is why, for those who can, supporting charities is more important than ever. Through The Christmas Challenge campaign, we are offering to match any donation made to hundreds of amazing charities throughtheBigGive.org.ukThat means whatever you can give will go twice as far.” The Christmas Challenge consists of many dferent charities, from small local organisations to large international charities. All the charities help those that need it most including refugees, children, older people and animals. The Christmas Challenge was launched in  by Sir Alec Reed, founder of Reed Recruitment. Last year, the campaign raised pound.m for  charities.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . -- related_article   n n  n n nAs Daniel ODonnells th birthday approaches he considers winding down a little n n n n n\".

The survey found Northern Ireland to be the most charitable UK region, with more than three-quartersagreeing that it is better to give gts than to receive them. Eileen Wilson, Food Services Manager at Footprints, Northern Ireland, a partner of national food distribution charityFareSharesaid: “Christmas does bring extra challenges for people close to poverty or struggling with mental health. “Expenses go up this time of year. Not just trying to buy food and gts, but also heating in winter.” A campaign organised by the Big Give and backed by celebrities such as Stephen Fry, Dame Judi Dench, Russell Brandand others is aiming to help. The Big Give Christmas Challenge is the UK’s biggest Christmas coordinated fundraising appeal, supporting over  charities to raise funds with the unique offer of matching any donations made during the week of November  to December . This gives thehundreds of participating charities the opportunity to have their donations doubled. Alex Day, Director of The Big Give said: “Our study shows that, sadly, people across Great Britain and Northern Ireland are facing an imperfect storm high fuel prices, chronic mental health problems, rising debt, loneliness and fears about Covid- will mean that, for many, this festive period will be a far cry from picture perfect scenes portrayed on Christmas cards. “Some will rely on charities which will be further and further stretched as demand grows. “That is why, for those who can, supporting charities is more important than ever. Through The Christmas Challenge campaign, we are offering to match any donation made to hundreds of amazing charities throughtheBigGive.org.ukThat means whatever you can give will go twice as far.” The Christmas Challenge consists of many dferent charities, from small local organisations to large international charities. All the charities help those that need it most including refugees, children, older people and animals. The Christmas Challenge was launched in  by Sir Alec Reed, founder of Reed Recruitment. Last year, the campaign raised pound.m for  charities.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . -- related_article   n n  n n nAs Daniel ODonnells th birthday approaches he considers winding down a little n n n n n\".

Council will now look at ways to allocate resources to establish a new Greenway link connecting Judges Road to the proposed site for the ‘Rural Greenway Hub’ at the Auld School Site on Temple Road. Councillor Fleming said: “This would be transformational. It would be a greater use and safer use of the Country Park, Gransha Woods andEnaghLough. “Also, it would mean the site, known to people as the old school and Church site, being brought back into use. This won’t just have an effect on the locality ofStrathfoylePark but also the city and greater district.Councillor Ferguson continued: “The Lough is on my doorstep and even I don’t know its full history. It has its own eco-system. “It is a rural hub and over lockdown, many people have discovered the Lough and have used it for a number of activities. It is a very rural area and this has impacted on many residents. “We are hoping with the aspirations for theEnaghLough country park that some of these issues would be addressed. “We are asking to secure a connection from theStrathfoylegreenway to the Lough and Gransha area which would be impactful for the new houses so they could actively walk or cycle to the Lough. “It would link the moss area to, hopefully, a country hub at the old school where safe parking could be accessed. “If we were to overlook this small connection, we would be overlooking an absolute gem in the area.” The Council also hopes in time toexpand the Greenway within the district to areas such as Eglinton. Councillor Mooney added:I was struck by the work that has already gone into this concept. Thisisa rural tourism project that will seek to bring eco, adventure, cultural and rural tourism within the site.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

Council will write toDfIfor investment in roads as a “matter of urgency.” Councillor Sandra Duffy brough the motion to Council and said that despite an allocation toDfI, with astructuralbudget of pound million, Derry roads are “not seeing the benefit of that investment”. CouncillorDuffy said that currently motorists were “dealing with a road network that is in an unacceptable condition and badly in need of investment”. Councillor Duffy described the roads in and out ofGalliaghas “patchwork quilts that have been filled and refilled.” Councillors supported the motion with many bringing forward their constituents concerns over potholes and road conditions. Councillor McCready said: “I have been on roads in Baghdad and Kabul and the roads are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland.” Councillor McKinney described the situation as a disgrace. He said: “There are parts of our district where the roads and the traffic system are like driving in a third world country. I have written on many occasions to the DfI roads, only to be told there are no funds. Councillor Reilly added: “All the councillors havedemonstratedthat there are issues affecting the roads in their area and that is an historical issue.” Councillor Devenney described the conditions of the roads as the worst he has seen them in at least  years.

Council will write toDfIfor investment in roads as a “matter of urgency.” Councillor Sandra Duffy brough the motion to Council and said that despite an allocation toDfI, with astructuralbudget of pound million, Derry roads are “not seeing the benefit of that investment”. CouncillorDuffy said that currently motorists were “dealing with a road network that is in an unacceptable condition and badly in need of investment”. Councillor Duffy described the roads in and out ofGalliaghas “patchwork quilts that have been filled and refilled.” Councillors supported the motion with many bringing forward their constituents concerns over potholes and road conditions. Councillor McCready said: “I have been on roads in Baghdad and Kabul and the roads are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland.” Councillor McKinney described the situation as a disgrace. He said: “There are parts of our district where the roads and the traffic system are like driving in a third world country. I have written on many occasions to the DfI roads, only to be told there are no funds. Councillor Reilly added: “All the councillors havedemonstratedthat there are issues affecting the roads in their area and that is an historical issue.” Councillor Devenney described the conditions of the roads as the worst he has seen them in at least  years. Due to a legal challenge, the resurfacing contracts for the council area have been delayed to next year. The pound.m resurfacing programme locally for the year up to March  had included the Clooney Road between Caw and Gransha Roundabouts, Church Street, Claudy,BarnailtRoad,Glensha neRoad,Killalooto Claudy and theArdloughRoad. As well as this, Circular Road,Creggan,PrehenPark,Le namoreRoad, Talbot Park, Maybrook Park, Larkhill,DrumleckDrive, St. Canice’s Park, Eglinton, Bluebell Hill Gardens.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

My whole le came to a halt.Derry Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch aims to raise more awareness and funds for an “illness we don’t talk about enough” Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseReporter: Nicole Lang Dec   addthis, Leslie Hill was sadly diagnosed with Parkinsons disease in April . googletag.cmd.push Parkinsons disease is a condition that affects the brain. It causes problems like shaking and stfness that get worse over time. The main symptoms of the disease are shaking, slow movements and stfness. Treatments for Parkinsons disease include therapies to help with movement problems, medicines and sometimes brain surgery. Parkinsons disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain. It’s not yet clear exactly why this happens. Leslie’s first symptoms were shown in his handwriting when it was still neat but very small. Then, in January , the -year-old, was getting ready to go to the dentist when his left hand would not move to brush his teeth. Leslie said: “After several attempts to brush my teeth, I realised something wasnt right. I contacted my GP and was sent to the hospital to do tests. “I was kept in for five days and had numerous tests. It was then that I was diagnosed. My whole le came to a halt. “Shortly after, I became a member of Parkinsons Foyle branch. I really enjoyed and appreciated the support that I got. “I helped to organise events and helped with fundraising. I was a committee member within six months and then I was asked to become Chairman. “It is and was such an honour, I was very pleased to be voted in. I have a vice chairman, Jackie Brolly. “There is a committee of  dedicated members, nothing is a bother to them. My we Rhonda is the secretary and Wendy Stuart is treasurer. “We have approximately  members and we are all one big family. “I have been acting Chairman since September  and officially since March . During my time as Chairman, we have given approximatelyfive to six thousand pounds every year to Parkinson’s research.” Parkinson’s Foyle Branch is a self-funded charity and they depend on the generosity of members of the public to keep the branch going. Their mission is ‘Together we will find a cure, and improve le for everybody affected by Parkinson’s.’ Leslie continued: “We’re close to major breakthroughs. Funding the right research into the most promising treatments, we get closer to a cure every day. “Until then, were here for everyone affected by Parkinson’s. Fighting for fair treatment and better services. Making everyone see its real impact. “People with Parkinson’s, scientists and supporters, fundraisers and families, carers and clinicians, all working side by side. “We are impatient for change, we’re taking a stand, speaking out, chipping in, and playing our part. “I cannot thank the members of the public enough as they have been tremendous. We also organise events with the money we receive to help Parkinson’s patients. “This includes dancing to music, exercise classes, massage and reflexology classes, yoga and many more as exercise is a good medicine for Parkinsons sufferers. “In the month of March, we hold our Annual General Meeting.

My whole le came to a halt.Derry Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch aims to raise more awareness and funds for an “illness we don’t talk about enough” Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseReporter: Nicole Lang Dec   addthis, Leslie Hill was sadly diagnosed with Parkinsons disease in April . googletag.cmd.push Parkinsons disease is a condition that affects the brain. It causes problems like shaking and stfness that get worse over time. The main symptoms of the disease are shaking, slow movements and stfness. Treatments for Parkinsons disease include therapies to help with movement problems, medicines and sometimes brain surgery. Parkinsons disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain. It’s not yet clear exactly why this happens. Leslie’s first symptoms were shown in his handwriting when it was still neat but very small. Then, in January , the -year-old, was getting ready to go to the dentist when his left hand would not move to brush his teeth. Leslie said: “After several attempts to brush my teeth, I realised something wasnt right. I contacted my GP and was sent to the hospital to do tests. “I was kept in for five days and had numerous tests. It was then that I was diagnosed. My whole le came to a halt. “Shortly after, I became a member of Parkinsons Foyle branch. I really enjoyed and appreciated the support that I got. “I helped to organise events and helped with fundraising. I was a committee member within six months and then I was asked to become Chairman. “It is and was such an honour, I was very pleased to be voted in. I have a vice chairman, Jackie Brolly. “There is a committee of  dedicated members, nothing is a bother to them. My we Rhonda is the secretary and Wendy Stuart is treasurer. “We have approximately  members and we are all one big family. “I have been acting Chairman since September  and officially since March . During my time as Chairman, we have given approximatelyfive to six thousand pounds every year to Parkinson’s research.” Parkinson’s Foyle Branch is a self-funded charity and they depend on the generosity of members of the public to keep the branch going. Their mission is ‘Together we will find a cure, and improve le for everybody affected by Parkinson’s.’ Leslie continued: “We’re close to major breakthroughs. Funding the right research into the most promising treatments, we get closer to a cure every day. “Until then, were here for everyone affected by Parkinson’s. Fighting for fair treatment and better services. Making everyone see its real impact. “People with Parkinson’s, scientists and supporters, fundraisers and families, carers and clinicians, all working side by side. “We are impatient for change, we’re taking a stand, speaking out, chipping in, and playing our part. “I cannot thank the members of the public enough as they have been tremendous. We also organise events with the money we receive to help Parkinson’s patients. “This includes dancing to music, exercise classes, massage and reflexology classes, yoga and many more as exercise is a good medicine for Parkinsons sufferers. “In the month of March, we hold our Annual General Meeting. Then, from April to December, we have monthly meetings. “At our meetings,we have  plus members and carers and we have a guest at every one of them. “Our meetings came to a halt in March  due to the Covid pandemic, the whole world had stopped due to this deadly virus. “With our dedicated committee members, we rang round all of our members and kept in touch. The Mayor of Derry and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke is attending the Foyle Branch’s Christmas Dinner on Friday December  to celebrate all the member’s efforts during this dficult period.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

Cllr Duffy who is Sinn Feacuteins local health spokesperson and also represents the Ballyarnett ward, said the JCVIs recommendation was welcome but it was vital that current health advice on mask wearing be adhered to in order to enhance the protection given by the booster. She said: “The announcement that the booster vaccine programme has been extended to include younger people is very welcome. “The COVID booster vaccination has been shown to be highly effective at preventing serious illness and the spread of the virus. “It is also notable that the gap between the second and third dose is to be cut to three months in an effort to stymie the further spread of COVID-. “While these measures are welcome it must be remembered that vaccines are but one tool in the kit. “It is vital that the Department of Health have an optimal level of testing and tracing in constant operation and that we all observe public health advice on hygiene and mask wearing. “Together all these tools can work to keep us safe and to reduce the pressures being endured by our health and social care workers.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

A number of questions were asked of respondents – one of which enquired about bullying in the workplace to which  per cent replied that they had been a victim of it. Other figures made for disturbing reading as well with  per cent saying that when off work for illness, they get no sick pay from their employer and have to rely on the governments statutory sick pay – a rate signicantly lower than their monthly wage. A further  per cent said they were struggling to pay their household bills while  per cent said their workforce was not friendly towards trade unions. DTUC Chairperson, Niall McCarroll said: “Derry Trades Union Council through this local workers survey, have provided an opportunity, a  and a voice for workers to have their say, local workers have now spoken. “The political classes and the bosses must now act to address the exploitation and undervaluing of our young people and the wider local labour force. “The local chambers of commerce must now also take on the responsibility, with others, of reversing years of wage inequalities and hardships, which have been created through profit driven local employment practices. “A local culture within our employment market which has derisory and insulting take home pay as fundamental to its existence, leaving local workers barely able to survive. “When it comes to telling us, what’s best for local people and what we need to improve and advance like other city’s, local business leaders, the council and other departments of a refined nature, regularly bestow upon us their collective unity of purpose, an unquestionable expertise. “In the knowledge that  per cent of local workers have experienced bullying and or harassment in the workplace and  per cent struggle to pay their bills, their message grows weak and lacks credibility, as they continue to profit and feed off grandiose statements. “Sixty nine per cent of local workers surveyed were women with  per cent of those surveyed earning below pound. per hour for their labour and  per cent gained employment under zero hours contracts, conditions stacked in favour of the rich and the business classes. “The laughter of our children is being muffled by local capitalists, we should not accept any young person being paid pound. an hour. Local businesses should be asked and make it known, how much they pay their workers and in turn we decide where we spend our money. “Pay rates should be listed on such things as restaurant menus, front doors of public houses and every retail outlet in shopping centres. “Forty eight per cent of local workers who completed the survey were employed in retail or the hospitality and tourism sectors with  per cent being left with no option but to use a food bank. “It would be disappointing and unjustied to think that local workers received such pittance during such times as the Fleadh Cheoil, City of Culture, Clipper Festival and other boom times for business and commerce groups. “Poverty pay and precarious working conditions suit our business leaders and creates the ideal environment to promote investment, come to Derry and you will have cheap labour at your disposal and a workforce which is largely non unionised and therefore not organised to challenge wage inequalities, voiceless. “Sixty five per cent of local workers surveyed said their workplace was not trade union friendly, this needs called out and challenged politically. “As a guiding principle, moving forward, every worker across the city and district should have unhindered access to the trade union of their choice and encouraged to organise and become active in that trade union. “We read regularly that our health and social care system is overstretched, the AE at Altnagelvin Hospital being unable to cope with demand, we have a mental health crisis, young people with a sense of hopelessness no future no vision, with local communities having some of the highest statistics in terms of social deprivation and poverty. “The link between substandard contracts of employment, poverty pay and socio economic hardships is well researched, poor terms and conditions of employment is putting pressure on our health service and working class communities. “Sixty seven per cent of local workers surveyed had no company sick pay and  per cent were unable to self isolate due to Covid- because they could not afford financially to do so. “The findings of this survey are stark and must be addressed as a matter of urgency, these findings must now be incorporated into any future party political election manestos and a central focus of any corporate plan from Derry City and Strabane District Council. “Our livelihoods and prosperity are of course important but we must also reconcile this with our identity, who we are and what we cherish the most.” The Derry News contacted the Derry Chamber of Commerce to comment in response to the DTUCs survey results but they declined to do so.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\"

A number of questions were asked of respondents – one of which enquired about bullying in the workplace to which  per cent replied that they had been a victim of it. Other figures made for disturbing reading as well with  per cent saying that when off work for illness, they get no sick pay from their employer and have to rely on the governments statutory sick pay – a rate signicantly lower than their monthly wage. A further  per cent said they were struggling to pay their household bills while  per cent said their workforce was not friendly towards trade unions. DTUC Chairperson, Niall McCarroll said: “Derry Trades Union Council through this local workers survey, have provided an opportunity, a  and a voice for workers to have their say, local workers have now spoken. “The political classes and the bosses must now act to address the exploitation and undervaluing of our young people and the wider local labour force. “The local chambers of commerce must now also take on the responsibility, with others, of reversing years of wage inequalities and hardships, which have been created through profit driven local employment practices. “A local culture within our employment market which has derisory and insulting take home pay as fundamental to its existence, leaving local workers barely able to survive. “When it comes to telling us, what’s best for local people and what we need to improve and advance like other city’s, local business leaders, the council and other departments of a refined nature, regularly bestow upon us their collective unity of purpose, an unquestionable expertise. “In the knowledge that  per cent of local workers have experienced bullying and or harassment in the workplace and  per cent struggle to pay their bills, their message grows weak and lacks credibility, as they continue to profit and feed off grandiose statements. “Sixty nine per cent of local workers surveyed were women with  per cent of those surveyed earning below pound. per hour for their labour and  per cent gained employment under zero hours contracts, conditions stacked in favour of the rich and the business classes. “The laughter of our children is being muffled by local capitalists, we should not accept any young person being paid pound. an hour. Local businesses should be asked and make it known, how much they pay their workers and in turn we decide where we spend our money. “Pay rates should be listed on such things as restaurant menus, front doors of public houses and every retail outlet in shopping centres. “Forty eight per cent of local workers who completed the survey were employed in retail or the hospitality and tourism sectors with  per cent being left with no option but to use a food bank. “It would be disappointing and unjustied to think that local workers received such pittance during such times as the Fleadh Cheoil, City of Culture, Clipper Festival and other boom times for business and commerce groups. “Poverty pay and precarious working conditions suit our business leaders and creates the ideal environment to promote investment, come to Derry and you will have cheap labour at your disposal and a workforce which is largely non unionised and therefore not organised to challenge wage inequalities, voiceless. “Sixty five per cent of local workers surveyed said their workplace was not trade union friendly, this needs called out and challenged politically. “As a guiding principle, moving forward, every worker across the city and district should have unhindered access to the trade union of their choice and encouraged to organise and become active in that trade union. “We read regularly that our health and social care system is overstretched, the AE at Altnagelvin Hospital being unable to cope with demand, we have a mental health crisis, young people with a sense of hopelessness no future no vision, with local communities having some of the highest statistics in terms of social deprivation and poverty. “The link between substandard contracts of employment, poverty pay and socio economic hardships is well researched, poor terms and conditions of employment is putting pressure on our health service and working class communities. “Sixty seven per cent of local workers surveyed had no company sick pay and  per cent were unable to self isolate due to Covid- because they could not afford financially to do so. “The findings of this survey are stark and must be addressed as a matter of urgency, these findings must now be incorporated into any future party political election manestos and a central focus of any corporate plan from Derry City and Strabane District Council. “Our livelihoods and prosperity are of course important but we must also reconcile this with our identity, who we are and what we cherish the most.” The Derry News contacted the Derry Chamber of Commerce to comment in response to the DTUCs survey results but they declined to do so.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\"

It recognises no borders. “Society across this island is demanding a robust response to the crisis we face and it is just common sense that it should be organised on an all-Ireland basis.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

However, Phase Two of the stadiums redevelopment has yet to proceed.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Dec Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Aontuacute councillor, Emmet Doyle, has demanded Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey to stop dragging her feet in progressing Phase Two of the redevelopment of Derry City FCs Brandywell Stadium. googletag.cmd.push In  a new  seater stand incorporating changing rooms and media facilities was completed at a cost of poundmillion. That brought the existing capacity of the ground to around . However, that was supposed to be part of wider development at the stadium with a second phase increasing capacity to . Cllr Doyle, who represents the Ballyarnett ward, expressed concern that Phase Two has yet to proceed and following a meeting with the Department of Communities, he said his was “dismayed” and “frustrated” at the lack of progress. He said: “A number of months ago I called for a meeting between Council and the Department to understand the level of progress made in progressing the Sub-Regional stadia programme which is currently holding up Phase Two of the Brandywell. “I am dismayed following the meeting that no time-frame has yet been set for the opening of the funding programme, and indeed the Department has not even set criteria. “Engagement has taken place with clubs and officials which is positive but this programme first opened a decade ago, and yet we are still waiting for movement despite it being part of New Decade New Approach. “I am massively frustrated that we are still at this early stage and the Minister needs to step in before the Assembly election next year to deliver on what was a programme that has raised the expectations of fans throughout the Council area.” Cllr Brian Tierney of the SDLP echoed Cllr Doyles concerns and accused Sinn Feacutein of failing to deliver. He added: “It’s extremely frustrating that the Department for Communities are unable to give us any indication around funding for the second phase of redevelopment work at the Brandywell Stadiun. “Over five years ago Sinn Feacutein told us this funding was guaranteed and the party’s Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey seems to have abandoned this promise.  “The Brandywell is an important community hub in our city, it’s not just used by our football clubs, but the general public and is open to everyone. The first phase of the redevelopment was a massive success, it delivered a modern stand for fans, a new greyhound track and much improved facilities. The second phase is now long overdue. “With fortunes changing for the better for Derry City on the pitch there could be no better time for Minister Hargey to recommit herself to this project. There is a new-found feeling of optimism around the club and we need to capitalise on this. “If we wish to bring more fans through the turnstiles then we have to be able to offer an experience befitting a modern football match. “Time and time again Sinn Feacutein have made promises to the people of Derry, but failed to deliver. We need the minister to get this funding scheme open so we can get a timeframe in place for this redevelopment work. “I will continue to press for action until our city has the stadium it deserves.” In response a Department for Communities spokesperson said: “The Minster is actively considering the outcomes of the refresh and re-engagement exercise undertaken in relation to the Sub Regional Stadia Programme.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

The Foyle MP will formally move the second reading of his Climate Emergency and Green Jobs Bill which aims to bring forward the date by which the British Government must achieve net-zero emissions to . Climate Change is the greatest threat our world faces, and we have ten days to legislate to save our planet. On th Dec, I’m bringing my Climate Change Bill to the Commons with progressive ideas to do our part to arrest the slide into climate catastrophe. #ClimateChangeBill pic RDOeSu     — Colum Eastwood December ,     The Bill also places a duty on Government Ministers to bring forward proposals for a corporate green levy on large businesses to resource climate action. Eastwood said global leaders have failed to grasp the chance to take action on climate change. “Over the last number of months, senior British Government Ministers have been at pains to establish their green credentials ahead of and during the COP conference in Glasgow, he said. While global leaders failed to grasp the real opportunity to take the bold action needed to prevent climate breakdown, the commitments made over that fortnight were substantial.  A unique opportunity - Irish public invited to share views on all-island rail network    Now Conservative Ministers have the opportunity to prove that Glasgow wasn’t all hot air and grandstanding for the world’s media. “The Bill I have produced alongside environmental leaders would signal a step change in this government’s attitude toward climate action and demonstrate that this is an emergency. I am proposing bringing forward the date by which net-zero emissions must be achieved to , introducing the first legislative climate emergency declaration and seeking the introduction of a new corporate green levy recognising that the burden for paying for climate rehabilitation should fall on those companies that have done the most damage. “Passing this Bill would be the first real demonstration that this government acknowledges that the house is on fire and we need to do something about it now. This legislation is radical because we cannot afford to be timid in the face of an emergency like this. I hope that political leaders will commit themselves to it in the days ahead.”  Foyle MLA Delargy accuses Poots of dithering on climate change     *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

The Foyle MP will formally move the second reading of his Climate Emergency and Green Jobs Bill which aims to bring forward the date by which the British Government must achieve net-zero emissions to . Climate Change is the greatest threat our world faces, and we have ten days to legislate to save our planet. On th Dec, I’m bringing my Climate Change Bill to the Commons with progressive ideas to do our part to arrest the slide into climate catastrophe. #ClimateChangeBill pic RDOeSu     — Colum Eastwood December ,     The Bill also places a duty on Government Ministers to bring forward proposals for a corporate green levy on large businesses to resource climate action. Eastwood said global leaders have failed to grasp the chance to take action on climate change. “Over the last number of months, senior British Government Ministers have been at pains to establish their green credentials ahead of and during the COP conference in Glasgow, he said. While global leaders failed to grasp the real opportunity to take the bold action needed to prevent climate breakdown, the commitments made over that fortnight were substantial.  A unique opportunity - Irish public invited to share views on all-island rail network    Now Conservative Ministers have the opportunity to prove that Glasgow wasn’t all hot air and grandstanding for the world’s media. “The Bill I have produced alongside environmental leaders would signal a step change in this government’s attitude toward climate action and demonstrate that this is an emergency. I am proposing bringing forward the date by which net-zero emissions must be achieved to , introducing the first legislative climate emergency declaration and seeking the introduction of a new corporate green levy recognising that the burden for paying for climate rehabilitation should fall on those companies that have done the most damage. “Passing this Bill would be the first real demonstration that this government acknowledges that the house is on fire and we need to do something about it now. This legislation is radical because we cannot afford to be timid in the face of an emergency like this. I hope that political leaders will commit themselves to it in the days ahead.”  Foyle MLA Delargy accuses Poots of dithering on climate change     *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.    More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

After continuing with his le, as best he could, he collapsed last year in his garden with back and leg pain. Kevin travelled to Istanbul last month to meet a specialist and will require surgery within a matter of months, which will cost in the region of pound,.

On Friday, June , their  and  U Feacuteile teams will play in a novel charity game, with all the funds going help Kevin and his family. “We are trying to raise as much money for Kevin and his family as possible,” said Philip Muldoon, one of the organisers. “We want the good people off Ballinderry and surrounding areas to come along and donate on the night of the match to keep the date free. “To any business people who would like to sponsor a prize for the raffle in the Bridge Bar afterwards they can do so by contacting myself or Karl Conlan. “Kevin is going to need a lot of help post and pre surgery and this will go a long way to doing that.” To mark the occasion Noel ONeill of Arboe based company ND Sports has made the outstanding gesture of sponsoring a one-off retro top for both teams.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

Pic by MonoPix.Reporter: Liam Tunney Dec Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, As the victorious Na Magha team came off the pitch at Kingspan Breffni Park on Saturday, one supporter signalled to manager Dee Doherty to keep hold of the black armbands. googletag.cmd.push The bands, worn by every member of the squad, were worn in memory of club stalwart Seaacuten Mellon, who passed away this month, and who coached many of the current senior team at one stage. Under the stand, with the inimitable sounds of championship victory coming from the changing room, Doherty said Seaacuten Mellons fingerprints were all over the win. “Theres not too many boys in that changing room that havent been coached by Seaacuten at some stage, whether it was underage or senior,” he told the County Derry Post. “He was an absolute legend of hurling in Derry and had a massive impact on the game today to be honest. Breandaacuten Quigley fields a high ball. Pic by MonoPix. “I would say we tried to keep the emotion out of it, and just used it to drive the boys on,” he added. The sight of Ruaidhriacute McLaughlin reeling off under the floodlights was greeted with joy in the stands, but also with a certain degree of relief. Having looked untroubled throughout the first half, Cootehill had forced their way back into the game and trailed by just a point going into the final quarter. “It was nervous enough at one stage,” said Doherty. “When we played the first half and talked about it in the changing room at half time, we thought we were fairly well in control. “Then we came out in the second half, and they put the pressure on us, and had it down to a one-point game at one stage.  Na Magha seal Ulster semi final spot with blistering final quarter  Ruaidhriacute McLaughlins th minute goal saw off a stubborn Cootehill side at Breffni Park.   “We talked about how we had let them back into it again, and we needed a big - minutes of hurling out of them. “Then Ruaidhriacute went up and scored the goal for us, and that sort of gave us a wee bit of a cushion. “To be fair, they responded well. I thought the subs came in and freshened things up, the likes of young Keelan there and boys like that helped us get a few scores.” There was a certain degree of rustiness on display. Na Magha had not had a competitive game since October  after Coleraine were unable to field in the junior final. However, with the cobwebs hopefully blown away, Doherty is looking towards the next game. “The big problem at the minute is that were in this competition and we havent won our county championship, so the preparations werent ideal,” he said. “Weve got a couple of challenge games in, which is the best we could do, but obviously not getting to play your county final meant we had no competitive games and we were very rusty. “Everybody wants to get to the final, but were in the semi final first, so hopefully we can get through that and see how it goes. “Weve a fair bit of work to do before this next game against Carrickmacross in two weeks time.”  Deep sadness as Derry hurling stalwart passes away  Seaacuten Mellon was one of the founding members of Na Magha CLG.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

Pic by Mary K Burke.Reporter: Liam Tunney Dec Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, A satisfied James McNicholl shted back and forth underneath the Owenbeg stand, trying to shake the effects of an hour and a half on the sideline in Storm Arwen. googletag.cmd.push His Dungiven side had just sealed back-to-back Jack Cassidy Cup titles with a win over Loup and with the howling wind muting the celebrations slightly, he had his eye on the future. “Hopefully we can get a springboard from this into senior football,” he told the County Derry Post. “We won in , and any momentum we would have got was halted with Covid and obviously that was more important at the time.  Derry GAA vice chairman Kieran McKeever presents the Jack Cassidy cup to Dungiven joint captains Darragh McGilligan and Cahair Higgins. Pic by Mary K Burke. “Weve four or five starting on the senior team there and most of the  lads are senior footballers now. There is plenty there to work with over the next couple of years. “[With Geoffrey in] its exciting times for the players and you know theyll buy into it. The talent is there – its always been there, but sometimes other things get in the way. “We are where we are as a senior team, thats the way the league tables are, and hopefully now well kick on and in four or five years time well be back in that conversation further up the table.” Despite a Carl Lagan goal bringing the deficit to just one in the second half, McNicholls St Canices side looked controlled and composed throughout the encounter. McNicholl said the elements had ruined the game as a spectacle, but that his side had a plan for managing the situation. “We got settled down at half time. We were a wee bit nervous and passes were going astray in the first half, but I thought we controlled it really well after half time,” he said.  Dungiven master the elements to seal back-to-back Jack Cassidy titles  A late Niall McGonagle penalty stretched the winning margin to five.   “There was such a big breeze in the first half the conditions dictated the game to be honest. Its nearly too big a breeze at times we were kicking the ball out of play and that. “Look, we worked on it, weve done it in training, so it was a matter of taking it from the training field onto the pitch.” “Its all about patience. We work hard on isolating one-on-ones and getting at your man, andyou cant do that in Gaelic football, you shouldnt be in the team. “The spaces will always open up at some point, it was a very defensive first half from them, and rightly so, they were facing a big breeze. “We knew theyd be there in the second half, but it just takes a bit of time. You get a bit of luck as well, but they knew they had it in them,” he added.

Written by Johnny Gogan and Brian Leyden and directed by Gogan, the film was produced by Dromahair-based Bandit Films. The film was scored by Sligo’s Glenn Garrett, edited by Dromahair-based Patrick O’Rourke and shot by Strandhill videographer Peter Martin. Black Ice tells the story of Alicewho is drawn into the clandestine boy - and girl - racing scene where Jimmyis considered top dog among the petrol heads in a fictional Donegal border community. Their relationship and their attempts to get into the legitimate rallying scene are undermined by forces at work in this shadowy border world threatening their ambition, the town where they live and, ultimately, Alice’s family. Black Ice received a wide release in Ireland in  and was one of the best Irish performers at the box office and on DVD that year. The film received repeat broadcasts on RTEacute. The film’s release on Netflix follows the recent release of Johnny Gogan’s feature documentary Hubert Butler Witness to the Future on the streaming service. The film will now be available - in multiple languages - across Netflix’ European network Johnny Gogan s to Donegal for the commencement of his new novel Station to Station. The pacy thriller about a rogue Irish diplomat commences and revisits at ious points in the narrative, Donegal’s Lough Derg pilgrimage island.

Johnny Gogan’s other feature drama work includes The Bargain Shop , The Last Bus Home , Mapmakerand the drama-documentary Prisoners of the Moon .

An Innocent Man: Saturday, Talking Pictures TV @ pm Jimmies living a grand le in Calornia. Mike and Danny are two crooked cops not averse to robbing and framing suspects. One day they all collide and lives are shattered. A gritty and vicious thriller from  that didnt strike a chord with TV audiences used to Sellecks friendly Magnum persona but its a film thats really worth reevaluation. Selleck, David Rasche, Laila Robins, Bjada Djola and F. Murray Abraham add to a heady mix. Zombieland: Saturday, Syfy @ pm Americas been overthrown by the undead and a young man from Columbus, Ohio just wants to get home. On his danger fraught journey he meets another survivor from Tallahassee, Florida and both decide to stick together. This is a joy, from its Metallica scored opening scene to its fairground set climax its pure and utter fun. Jesse Eisenberg,Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin are all game for a laugh here. Parasite: Saturday, Channel  @ pm The Kims are living a miserable existence in a basement apartment in Seoul. The Parks live a comfortable le in a beautul home overlooking the city. The youngest Kim goes to work for the Parks and things are never the same again. Parasite is amazing. A e into Korean society that manages to be hilarious, nervewracking, terrying and exhilarating all at once. A totally deserved best picture winner.Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin and Cho Yeo-jeong are just perfect in their parts. I Went Down: Sunday, RTEacute One @ .am  Two criminals travel into the wilds of rural Ireland to carry out a kidnapping at the behest of a man who owns them both. Things dont work out exactly as planned. For my money one the the best Irish comedies ever made. Brendan Gleeson is on fire as Bunny Kelly and Peter McDonald is good craic in his film debut. As always with Irish films the laughs come with a healthy dose of pathos and the two blend brilliantly. Apocalypse Now: Sunday, BBC Two @ .am  Captain Willard has been tasked with going up the NugravengRiver to terminate a rogue American Colonel with extreme prejudice. What he sees on his journey with stay with him and you forever. A nightmarish, drug fueled masterpiece and a harrowing, troubling, darkly comic  psychotic look into the troubling heart of man. If you havent seen it yet Im very jealous. Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Larry Fishburne, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper will all blow you away. The Day Of The Locust: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .am The film where Donald Sutherland plays Homer Simpson. Yup. The s were a bad time in America and people flooded into Hollywood to find fame and fortune away from the Great depression. It worked out for some and not for others. A vicious and biting satire of the film industry. Flamboyant and extravagant in places, downright horrying in others. Its fantastic though and packed full of too many famous faces to list. Gone Baby Gone: Monday, Great! Movies @ pm A young girl goes missing in South Boston and a pair of investigators are hired to find her. A tough ask made tougher by red tape and the web of crime surrounding every aspect of the case. Ben Afflecks adaption of Dennis Lehanes book is a powerful and upsetting watch that will make you ask yourself questions you might not like the answers to. Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Amy Ryan and Ed Harris all do affecting work. Alfie: Monday, TCM @ pm Alfies a self centred ass, he loves himself, loves to hear himself talk. Women love him too but he treats them like dirt, taking what he wants from them before throwing them aside. Then one day le decides to slap him in the face. Controversial on release and highly influential in the years since this  drama is an excellent look at the light and dark of the swinging s. Michael Caine, Shelley Winters and Julia Foster all nail their parts. Transsiberian: Monday, Great! Movies Action @ .pm A couple are travelling home from China and take the train to Moscow. Along the way they meet another couple. Things get......well youll just have to see for yourself. A finely crafted and atmospheric watch from the Hitchcockian school of thrillers. Its rather violent and one scene may have you reaching for the remote but stick with it, its worth your time. Woody Harrelson, Emily Mortimer, Kate Mara and Ben Kingsley do good work The Man From Colorado: Tuesday, Film @ .pm Owen Devereauxs been appointed the federal judge of a region in Colorado but hes not exactly suited to the job. He has psychopathic tendencies that have, in the past during the civil war, been covered up by his friend Del, a man not willing to do it anymore. From  comes an uncommonly deep and thoughtful western that isnt afraid to shy away from big themes. For once Glenn Ford plays a villainous part and he does it well. William Holden and James Millican excel in supporting roles. The Man Who Knew Too Much: Wednesday, Film @ .pm An American family take an impulsive trip to Morocco and finds themselves in the midst of an assassination attempt and their lives are immediately in danger. It sounds heavy but this is one of Alfred Hitchcocks lighter and more enjoyable films. James Stewart and Doris Day lead the film and are delightful as their roles as always. A highly enjoyable and suspenseful film worth recording for a rainy afternoon. Deep Blue Sea: Wednesday, TCM @ pm In an attempt to find a cure for Alzheimers disease a scientist grows mega sharks so she can experiment on their brains. These sharks are kept in a secret facility but guess what  They are really brainy and really hungry. Renny Harlins sci actioner from  is gloriously stupid but its loads and loads of fun too. Blood spills and jokes fly as a wicked cast that includes Thomas Jane, Aida Turturro, Saffron Burrows and Samuel L. Jackson struggle to stay in one piece. The Conversation: Thursday, BBC @ pm Harrys a surveillance expert and hes got a new job. But the work is getting to him and his paranoia is at an all time high due to past events. Francis Ford Coppolas  thriller is a stunner. A post Watergate classic seeped in the pervading atmosphere of a broken country. Gene Hackmans spectacular as a man coming apart at the seams and the late John Cazale as his partner is as always magnicent. A nerve shredding watch. The Blood On Satans Claw: Friday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm A rural village in th century England is thrown into upheaval when an evil looking skull is unearthed by a plough and sinister things start happening in the aftermath. A prime example of folk horror, a subgenre from the early s that would still give you the chills nearly  years later. Its hefty stuff, that in places will offend but its genuinely effective. Patrick Wymark, Linda Hayden and Barry Andrews all do strong work. Damsel: Friday, TG @ .pm A man travels across the American Frontier of the th century on a little horse called Butterscotch. Hes looking for the love of his le so he can propose and the only thing between him and happiness is danger. A lot of danger. A slowburn pace might annoy some but this left-field take on the western genre is an entertaining and twisting watch propelled by nice turns from Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska. Lapsis: Friday, Film @ .pm Rays taken a strange new job to help support his ailing brother. Hes marching into the woods, dragging miles of cable behind him to connect up cubes used for futuristic trading. To say more would be a ruin a unique and humorous satirical look at the exploitative techniques modern day employment is made up of. Its not always successful but its last  minutes really hits the spot. Dean Imperial as Ray is one to keep an eye out for. As always visit hamsandwichcinema.blogspot for more film and tv chat.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

However, the scoreboard remained the same as heroic UCC defence and a lack of accuracy at crucial times undid all the hard work.A forward pass undid one multi-phase attack and a penalty given away in an attacking position from an otherwise excellent line-out maul foiled another.Then a superb scrummaging effort won the home side a penalty on the UCC five-metre line. Ballynahinch looked to turn the screw and opted for another scrum, only to give away a penalty and come away from another stint in the UCC  with nothing.As the opportunities came and went UCC continued to defend well and kick superbly and when Squires got them out of trouble with a brilliantly executed - kick to give them a foothold in Ballynahinch territory they were visibly lted and reasserted themselves in attack.They were able to close out the game, despite missing a penalty in front of the posts and having another kick and chase try disallowed for a knock-on, leaving Ballynahinch reflecting on how they failed to turn all their possession and territory statistics into points.The league table, which is the only statistic that counts at the end of the season, shows Ballynahinch at the bottom, having been defeated by their nearest rivals in their last two outings.There is no respite as Munster giants Cork Constitution roll into Ballymacarn Park this weekend on the back of three consecutive wins, having shrugged off their uncharacteristically slow start to the season.Ballynahinch : John Dickson, Zack McCall, Kyle McCall, James Simpson, John Donnan, Thomas Donnan, Oli Loughead, Bradley Luney, Chris Gibson, Jack Milligan, Aaron Cairns, Rory Butler, Tagen Strydom, Shane Ball, Yasser Omar, Josh Hanlon, Nacho Cladera Crespo, Diego Vidal Souza, Callum Irvine, Conor McCauley, Greg Hutley..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Business boost for high street  ","story":"BUSINESSES across the district are being given a unique opportunity to help shape the future of high streets across the Newry, Mourne and Down area.Members of a Stormont task force spearheading a new initiative will be in Downpatrick next week for a workshop designed to provide local people with their say on how to rejuvenate town centres in a post-Covid world.Junior ministers Gary Middleton and Declan Kearney mdash who are leading the task force mdash will be at Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn on Thursday,December , and are encouraging business owners and residents to come along and have their say during what is being billed as an evidence gathering exercise.A number of local councillors have echoed their appeal for people to take part in the two-hour event which starts at pm.Designed to help make town, city and village centres places where people can do business, socialise, shop, be creative and use public services, the task force is determined to make a dference, with its membership including a raft of government departments and key organisations including Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster.The junior ministers say while there are many common and shared challenges, they recognise that every high street is dferent and has its own character, personality and needs that will each require bespoke local solutions.They want to hear views and evidence from far and wide, across both urban and rural areas and are urging e everyone with an interest in the future of their local high street to respond to the call for evidence and share their views.The task forcersquos visit to Downpatrick comes after it was revealed that there are currently  empty shop units in the town centre.In addition, the finishing touches are being put to a pound, revitalisation scheme in Church Street, while work is continuing to redevelop the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty, adjacent buildings as part of a major retail and commercial development opportunity which, it is hoped, can attract a number of leading retailers.Ahead of the Downpatrick consultation event, the business community and wider civic society is being asked to put forward ideas on what success in high streets could look like, with the focus on family friendly destinations where people want to shop, socialise, live and work.The task force said the series of workshops provide important opportunities for everyone to have their say and make their views known, with the junior ministers particularly keen to hear from a wide spectrum of people.Mr Kearney added: ldquoOur high streets are for everyone.

This was due mostly to a long, very arduous hill along the back straight but there were also some very tricky tight turns which were treacherous.There was a long downhill which some used as recovery but others saw this as a chance to gain places and they threw caution to the wind, flinging themselves down the descent in an alarming fashion.The spectators had plenty to watch and saw the runners several times per lap.Mackenzie Murray found it hard to get himself into the groove in the U-  race and despite coming second overall, he felt that his performance was under par.Looking back at how well he ran in Ballyclare recently, it is hard to argue with this self assessment. In any case he is sure to go out with intent on his next outing to get a better showing.Although the overall event is referred to as the Comber Cup, in fact it is only the men who are in for that trophy.

She professes to hate cross country but had been enticed back by the many photos of smiling faces at cross country this season.She enjoyed the camaraderie, raced well despite less consistent run training than she would like and left saying that was her done with grass for one year.Letrsquos hope the post race cake might tempt her back. Steph Graham was next to cross the line for the club in .. She is a new addition to the EDAC ranks having transferred from City of Lisburn AC.It was idly rumoured that her recent marriage to club member Gordy Graham had cited this move in a pre-nuptial contract but in reality it came down to her now being closer to Downpatrick than her previous training grounds.While she is sad to leave her previous longterm club, she knows that she will be warmly welcomed by all in East Down. She had a good strong run and was pleased to have performed well in her first time in the new vest.Next was Sharon Madinewho nailed it in her usual business like way.

It calls you to be salt and light about what you believe in, she said.ldquoIt does annoy me when people say you have to take religion out of politics and leave it at the doorhelliplike it only happens at the weekend. It is part of who you are.ldquoYour Christianity and your faith is something that is with you all the time. You canrsquot just leave it at home on Sunday night and go out without it on Monday.Mrs Foster said she does not hold grudges against those who had hurt her, including former colleague Edwin Poots, who ousted her from the DUP leadership in May before being forced out of office himself just weeks later.Reflecting on the decision by Sinn Fein to collapse the executive with the resignation of then Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness in , she said: ldquoWe got into a spiral and we couldnrsquot stop it and it got to a point then where the assembly collapsed and of course I regret that it was down for three years.She said she liked the late DUP leader Ian Paisley very much. ldquoHe used to joke with me and say, lsquoHow are the Anglicans doing Arlenersquo Asked by Mr Kellyshe thought Dr Paisley had mellowed over the years, she said: ldquoI never knew Dr Paisley personally until   and I think he probably was in a dferent space than he had been in the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties.She declined to speculate on what might have changed him. ldquoI donrsquot know. I canrsquot answer that. I only know he was very supportive of me as a female and an Anglican and as an outsider. He asked me to be in the administration in  which I have always been very thankful for.Mrs Foster said her Christian faith helped her to seek common ground with people she did not agree with, adding that her reason forgoing into government with Sinn Fein was to make sure that her children and others did not endure what she went through as a child.This included the attempted murder in  on her father, John, an RUC reservist, living on the Fermanagh border, and a bomb attack on her school bus driver in which her friend was left severely injured.Recalling the gun attack on her father, when she was around eight years old, she said he came crawling back from the barn, after gunshots were fired, with blood dripping from his forehead.ldquoIt was a very strange time, she said. ldquoMy mother was sitting at the kitchen table and I donrsquot know what she was doing but I will never forget her face. She just froze.Ms Foster said it was not politically correct to say it, but she felt she benefited from being educated at an all-girl school, where she grew in confidence.The former political leader said she was enjoying her new role in journalism as a presenter on GB news - but said more must be done to tackle the hurtful abuse on social media particularly against women.Mrs Foster was welcomed by Dr Tim Campbell, director of the St Patrick Centre, who said her personal story was incredibly interesting.He remarked: ldquoArlene Foster was extremely gracious and gave very generously of her time and people in the audience responded to her warmth..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  November 28%2C 2001  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Angry traders in Downpatrick have this week called for tougher action to be taken against teenagers terrorising local businesses.They are demanding that the townrsquos police commanders are provided with additional resources to take the problem and that the courts hand out much stfer sentences.Their call comes amid mounting concern about the behaviour of an umber of juveniles who are verbally abusing and intimidating female staff in shops throughout the town and stealing from businesses.Traders say they are becoming increasingly frustrated that no punitive action is taken against the teenagers when they appear before the courts and that the sentences handed out to them are too light.The current position is so serious that number of shop owners are locking their doors during opening hours and admitting customers only after a visual check.One local trader, who did not want to be named, said the teenagers responsible for the trouble were being allowed to intimidate the business community and suggested an exclusion order should be placed on them, banning them from the town.ldquoThese people have no fear and no shame and walk about the town asthey owned the place.

Once people leave the bars they then head over to the takeaways where they hang out until around .am.ldquoEveryone is usually very drunk and I believe this is leading to a lot of the sectarian trouble in the town. It is completely unfair to any residents living close by who are trying to sleep and are kept awake by drunk people hanging around the streets, he said.SEAFORDE mdash A mother of five feels she has no choice to to move house following plans to erect a telecommunications mast at Seaforde.Siobhan Devlin recently moved into her home at Dunnanew Road and was horried to discover that a number of mobile telephone companies are planning to extend an existing mast close to her house to accommodate  new antennae.She is so concerned about the effects the mast could boast to her childrenrsquos health she is seriously considering selling her newly build dream house.Accusing mobile phone companies of being completely undemocratic by putting masts up against the wishes of the local community, she said she cannot understand why a decision was taken to extend a mast so close to a large number of houses.The Seaforde community is overwhelmingly behind Siobhan and a group of parents, concerned for the health of their children, have written a letter to planners demanding the development is stopped.She said: ldquoEveryone is completely shocked that such a major proposal has ben put to planners so close to our homes. A large area of residential land will be affectedthis plan goes ahead and nobody is happy about it.ldquoWe feel that we are being used as guinea pigs as nobody can tell us they are  per cent sure that these masts do not pose any health risks.ldquoDo planners honestly believe that residents, especially those with young children, will accept this proposal  If the plan goes ahead I really think I will have to move as I do not want my children living so close to that mast.KILLOUGH mdash Plans for the regeneration of Killough were put before Down councillors at a meeting on Monday night.Representatives from the Palatine Trust met with members of the councilrsquos recreation and technical services committee to give an update on how the regeneration work in the village is developing and discussed future plans for the area.The council has funded pound, towards the refurbishment of the harbour area since the trust was first set up in .

Monaghan.DAERA officials have also confirmed, late last night, the presence of Avian Influenza in two wild birds retrieved from the Belfast Waterworks site earlier this week.Disease control zones have been put in place around all infected premises to mitigate against onward disease spread.Under the new housing measures, all bird keepers in NI will be legally required to keep their birds indoors or otherwise separate from wild birds, and to follow strict biosecurity measures.This applies to owners of pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard or hobby flock.Announcing the decision to introduce a housing order, Minister Poots said: ldquoI took the decision to introduce the new housing measures in order to try to prevent an incursion of avian influenza into the poultry flock in Northern Ireland.ldquoIt is now a legal requirement for all poultry and captive bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds.ldquoThis decision was based on sound expert advice and in consultation with industry.ldquoThis decision to house is an additional step to the Avian Influenza Prevention Zoneintroduced on November , and is another necessary precautionary measure requiring all bird keepers to keep their birds housed.ldquoThese housing measures build on the strengthened biosecurity measures that were brought in as part of the AIPZ.ldquoSince my decision to introduce the housing order, we have now discovered avian flu in two wild birds in Belfast ndash that tells us unequivocally that the disease is already here and in our wild bird population.ldquoKeeping it out of the commercial flocks is now down to our poultry sector and the measures they take to keep the disease out.ldquoAdhering to, and a constant review of, all biosecurity measures is the best weapon we have to avoid an incursion.ldquoMy officials will continue to liaise closely with stakeholders and colleagues in GB and the Republic as the situation develops.To assist all bird keepers in complying with the new rules, a Biosecurity self-assessment tool has been developed that is available on the DAERA website.If avian influenza were to enter NI, the disease would have a signicant and devastating impact on our poultry industry, international trade and the wider economy.Poultry and captive bird keepers are advised to be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and to seek prompt advice from their vetthey have any concerns.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Photo: Liam McBurney PA Wire“Sinn Fein in  denied unionist MLAs the opportunity to mark Northern Ireland’s centenary by laying a simple stone or planting a rose bush in Stormont. Sinn Fein snub the Royal Family [and are] unable to even mark the Duke of Edinburgh’s passing in the same way as other countries.“Such cultural and identity weaponisation will make solutions very dficult to come by as some want cultural domination rather than respect.”Sinn Fein chairman Declan Kearney said that publishing the report without an implementation plan was a “mistake” and called for “an orderly implementation” of its deliverable proposals, PA reported.The report said that many “challenges remain” surrounding flags, bonfires and memorials. There has already been criticism that the -page report, which has cost approximately £,, is not accompanied by a plan for implementing its recommendations.The commission was set up in  to find consensus on a number of contentious issues, but devolution collapsed before it could deliver a report. Its findings were submitted to the first and deputy first ministers last July, and were finally published yesterday. It made  recommendations but it is unlikely they will be enacted. There are  commissioners, including seven from political parties and eight independent members, overseen by Professor Dominic Bryan.On the issue of flying flags on lampposts or other street furniture, the report states: “The commission could not agree on whether changes should be made to current legislation in order to create a similar exemption to that which exists for election posters. “Consequently, without any legislative changes, the commission is not in a position to recommend a code of practice that would accompany any such legislative change.”The report also said there had been “no meeting point” reached on the flying of flags at public buildings. Nor could commissioners agree to take an audit of the number of memorials – mainly paramilitary related – on public land or buildings. The report said that flags supporting paramilitary organisations should not be flown.The commission also discussed the possibility of developing a new civic flag to be “representative of the ersity of our society”.On bonfires, it recommended that the Executive recognises “that they are an important aspect of the culture, identity and tradition of communities and are therefore a legitimate form of celebration or commemoration, provided they are compliant with the law”.The report finally recommended that an Executive action plan was produced on how to implement its recommendations, and to explore unresolved issues.First Minister Paul Givan said the the report had considered a range of complex issues. He added: “It is right that the public have a chance to see the report and have their say, and today’s publication will allow them to do that.”Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The FICT report examines a number of sensitive issues across our community. Addressing these issues is an important part of moving our shared society forward and I put on record my thanks to the commission for their efforts in undertaking this challenging work.”TUV leader Jim Allister said little had been agreed, and so it was “a colossal waste of money”. He said it was clear that some within the media are intent on using ideas that were “discussed but not agreed – such as the preposterous suggestion that the Irish tricolour would be given parity on buildings – as the basis to frame public debate”.Speaking in a personal capacity, PUP deputy leader John Kyle said that any report without an action plan will simply gather dust. “This report, which contains some credible and valuable recommendations, will be a waste of time and public moneythere is no implementation plan,” he added.Sinn Fein’s Mr Kearney said: “I would much rather see scaffolding established in order to ensure an orderly implementation of those proposals within the report that I believe are deliverable.“There are then clearly challenges which remain, butwe had had a framework of next steps then we could tackle those.“It is for the parties who oppose the good sense of an implementation plan to speak and answer for themselves.”SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said the first and deputy first ministers sat on the report for  months before MLAs compelled them to publish it. These issues go to the heart of isions, she said, which was far too important to allow the document to become “an £, ornament” at Stormont.Loyalist activist Jamie Bryson said loyalists should be very attentive to the outworking of any regulation flowing from the report. He said: “It is not about enhancing culture, it is about strangling it – slowly but decisively – via carefully constructed regulatory architecture which is superficially attractive, and often buttressed with financial incentives, but which is ultimately culturally corrosive.”#MORE NEWS:Flags report: ‘Belfast-centred focus on flags that ignores rural victims concerns’A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

We got agreement through all the political parties on these issues.”On the failure of Stormont’s Executive Office to publish the report until now, Dr Bryan said: “I can’t speak for why the Executive Office haven’t been able to get it through but there are quite a lot of complexities going on here around the cultural area — including two new language commissions being set up, the setting up of an office of identity and cultural expression which was in the new deal new approach, and all of this stuff has been going forward.“And all of this is in the mix so, in fairness to them [the Executive Office], there are quite a lot of complexities into how you move this forward.”Dr Bryan also said the report had sought to find ways to enable, rather than restrict, “cultural practice”.“If you look at bonfires, for example, they are surrounded by a whole lot of legislation which is really nothing to do with the celebrations and commemorations which bonfires are part of,” he said. “And they sort of get in the way.“So this report is starting to look at the legislative areas and we are suggesting ways that will enable cultural practice.“We haven’t set out in this to stop anybody doing anything. Actually, contrary to that, we look at ways people can be enabled to do things within the law.”He said there was “less progress” on the topic of flags in public areas.Dr Bryan added: “With the flags on public buildings, that is the one area of all of our chapters where I think we got less progress and I think we are all disappointed at that.”Justice Minister Naomi Long has accused Stormont’s Executive Office of a “complete failure of leadership” for failing to “drive forward” progress on the report.The Alliance Party leader, speaking to BBC Radio Ulster, criticised the absence of a plan to put the report’s proposals into practice.She said the long awaited report had now been “abandoned”.She also slammed the long delay in publishing the report, which was given to the Executive “nearly two years ago”.“I think it’s absolutely scandalous that £, was spent on a report that we have had to wait almost two years to see,” she said. “We were told it would be published with an implementation plan.”She continued: “I’ve been writing to the Executive Office and my party’s had a debate in the Assembly on this in March, asking that it be published with an implementation plan so that we could start to take up some of those themes, and where there wasn’t agreement try to find agreement and where there was agreement try to implement it.“Instead, it’s now just being orphaned with nobody taking responsibility for it, which I think is absolutely scandalous.”The minister added: “These are issues that affect people’s everyday lives - bonfires, flags, paramilitary trappings on buildings, all of those things that people are constantly concerned about and raise with us regularly. Instead of taking political leadership and trying to drive a programme of work to address them, this is now simply being abandoned.“Unfortunately, I did say at the time of the Haas talks that that might well be the outcome which was one of the reasons we were very lukewarm on the outcome of those talks.”On whether the report’s findings would be put into practice by the devolved administration, she said: “It certainly doesn’t seem to be going to be implemented by the Executive Office.“We will seek to try to drive forward some progress where we can on that report as a party.“But obviously it should be being done on a cross-departmental basis, and it should be driven forward by the Executive Office. It’s a complete failure of leadership on their part.”South Belfast DUP MLA and lead member on the Executive Office Committee Christopher Stalford welcomed the publication of the report.Flags, Identity, Culture and Tradition Report.“The public should now give its views,” he said.“The answer on these matters is mutual respect but it is hard to come by when Sinn Fein campaigns to remove every trace of Britishness from Northern Ireland. “Sinn Fein in  denied unionist MLAs the opportunity to mark Northern Ireland’s centenary by laying a simple stone or planting a rose bush in Stormont. Sinn Fein snub the Royal Family. Unable to even mark the Duke of Edinburgh’s passing in the same way as other counties.“Such cultural and identity weaponization will make solutions very dficult to come by as some want cultural domination rather than respect.“We are complex society drawn mainly from the British Isles. A mix of Irish, English, Welsh and Scots. Some of us are British, some are Irish, some are Northern Irish and there are new and emerging identities.“I will always defend the dignied display of the flag of my country but I will never make excuses for the display of anything that could be associated with a paramilitary organisation. I will always promote the celebration of culture but I will never support anything which glories terrorism or promotes violence. I trust every Party will arrive at a similar position.”Loyalist activist Jamie Bryson said loyalists should be very attentive to the ultimate outworking of any regulation. “It is not about enhancing culture, it is about strangling it- slowly but decisively- via carefully constructed regulatory architecture which is superficially attractive, and often buttressed with financial incentives, but which is ultimately culturally corrosive,” he said.“The purpose of all of these things is to neutralise, and by extension diminish, PUL culture and traditions. The ‘process’ requires the incremental dismantling of the Union, and a key part of that is stage by stage watering down expressions of British and Unionist culture and sovereignty. “This is never more evident than in the FICT proposal for a civic flag. This requires unionism accepting that the sovereign flag of the United Kingdom should not fly, and instead should be replaced by a neutral flag. That of course therefore means further dilution of visible manestations of our sovereignty. “If the  Agreement was a settlement rather than a process, then that settlement should respect the primacy of sovereignty and expressions of same. “The way forward on flags and bonfires in voluntary regulation schemes whereby loyalist communities would self regulate. Any engagement with statutory schemes, in the context of the cultural war whereby statutory bodies are often nationalist soldiers in that battle, would be foolish and self defeating. “You can not regulate culture. I should say however that the proposals for education in terms of Human Rights and the Law is a valuable proposal. PUL communities have been frozen out of the legal arena, and there is a signicant disconnect. In contrast, nationalist communities have very successfully weaponised the law to advance their political objectives. Unionists and loyalists must build the capacity to engage in this kind of lawfare, rather than being confined to the sidelines.”Read the full report here.MORE NEWS:When is Spoty wrapped  How to find your data and who is expected to be the most streamed artist of  A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The new restrictions come into force after the Omicron iant was found to be in both England and Scotland. From Tuesday, anyone arriving into Northern Ireland from non-red list countries , including those who are fully vaccinated, will now be required to self-isolate and take a PCR test before the end of day two. All contacts with a suspected case of Omicron will have to isolate for  days, regardless of their vaccination status, amid concerns existing jabs will be less effective against the strain that is believed to spread rapidly.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fcedfafae   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ebcfebcbeacea   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1638283527137.jpg--covid_19___tue_30th_november_figures.jpg?163828352700","title":"covid  tue th november figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows two further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.
