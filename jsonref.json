The economy has got a long uphill struggle.\u0027 The Mail revealed earlier this week how the Prime Minister is \u0027extremely concerned\u0027 about the possibility a second spike of infections could start in the next two weeks. His remarks in recent days come in stark contrast to his message a fortnight ago when he expressed hope that all social distancing restrictions may be ditched in time for Christmas.Yesterday, Mr Johnson insisted Britain has had \u0027massive success\u0027 in bringing down mortality rates but warned: \u0027I have to tell you we\u0027re looking at a resurgence of the virus in some other European countries, you can see what\u0027s been happening in the United States.\u0027So it is absolutely vital as a country we continue to keep our focus and discipline, and that we don\u0027t delude ourselves that somehow we\u0027re out of the woods or that this is all over, because it isn\u0027t all over.\u0027Despite the rise in the level of infections, the numbers are still way below the peak on May 1 when 6,201 cases were confirmed in just one day.Mr Smith, whose Crawley constituency includes Gatwick Airport, last night said: \u0027Testing should play a much larger role in giving people confidence to travel.\u0027Do I have to cancel my wedding? Can I still celebrate Eid? Your questions answered as 4.5million people in Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Yorkshire are hit by new lockdownWhat has the Government announced?Health Secretary Matt Hancock last night that people from different households in Greater Manchester, parts of east Lancashire and West Yorkshire will be banned from meeting each other in their homes and in their gardens from midnight.Which areas are affected?The new restrictions apply to the whole of Greater Manchester, parts of east Lancashire including Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle and Rossendale as well as Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees in West Yorkshire.The same restrictions will also apply to Leicester, which saw the first so-called \u0027local lockdown\u0027 imposed on June 29.What does this mean for the people living there?The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said that the new measures will mean people in these areas will not be permitted to mix with other households outside those in their support bubbles in private homes or gardens.Households will be able to go to bars, pubs and other hospitality venues but two households should not go together, the department added.The DHSC said that restrictions currently in place in Blackburn which saw indoor swimming pools, indoor fitness and dance studios, indoor gyms and sports facilities remaining closed will continue.Why is this being done?In a series of tweets Mr Hancock said that there had been an increasing rate of transmission in parts of Northern England.He said that this was due to \u0027households gathering and not abiding by the social distancing rules\u0027 and the new rules were being put in place in order to \u0027keep the country safe\u0027.How will the restrictions be enforced?The Government said it will sign new regulations to make the changes \u0027legally enforceable\u0027 and will give local authorities and police forces the powers to enforce these restrictions.How fast is the virus spreading?According to the most recent figures from Public Health England (PHE) the rate of infection is increasing across 13 of the 19 local authorities in the areas where the new measures are being imposed.In Blackburn with Darwen, the rate has risen from 83.3 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to July 20 to 89.3 in the seven days to July 27. A total of 133 new cases have been recorded.Leicester has the second highest seven-day rate despite it falling from 67.8 per 100,000 people to 60.2 over the same period, with 214 new cases.Over the same period the rate has also increased in Manchester, Burnley, Pendle, Bradford, Calderdale, Oldham, Bury, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan, but fell in Hyndburn, Rossendale, Kirklees, Bolton and Rochdale.Rochdale, Oldham, Blackburn and Pendle have been on a PHE watchlist as an \u0027area of concern\u0027 after elevated rates of infection.What is happening in Leicester?The DHSC said that from Monday restaurants, cafes, bars and hairdressers in Leicester can open again in line with the easing of restrictions across the rest of the country on July 4.Leisure centres, gyms and pools will remain closed but cinemas and museums will open and religious ceremonies will be able to take place, it added.The department said that all local restrictions currently in place in the neighbouring borough of Oadby and Wigston will end.But Mr Hancock said that the restrictions on social gatherings imposed on Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and West Yorkshire would also apply to the city of Leicester.Does my household include close family members?Your household – as defined in law – is only the people you live with. If you have formed a support bubble (which must include a single adult household i.e. people who live alone or single parents with dependent children aged under 18) these can be treated as if they are members of your household.What will be illegal?It will be illegal for people who do not live together to meet in a private home or garden, except for limited exceptions to be set out in law. You should not host or visit people you do not live with, unless they are in your support bubble. If you live in the affected areas, you should not visit someone\u0027s home or garden regardless of whether this is in or outside of the restricted area.Can I still meet indoors with people in my support bubble?Yes. Where people from single adult households (people who live alone or single parents with dependent children aged under 18) have formed a support bubble with another household, they can continue to visit each other, stay overnight, and visit other public places as if they were one household.Can I still meet people outdoors?In line with the national guidance, you can continue to meet in public outdoor spaces in groups of no more than six people, unless the group includes only people from two households. You cannot meet people you do not live within a private garden.At all times, you should socially distance from people you do not live with – unless they are in your support bubble.I live in this area. Can I still meet with my family and friends to celebrate Eid?Due to higher rates of infection, if you live in this area you should not host or visit friends and family in each other\u0027s homes or gardens. It will shortly be illegal to do so, unless specific exemptions apply. You also should not meet friends and family in other venues – including restaurants or cafes.Up to two households, or six people from any number of households may meet outdoors (excluding people\u0027s gardens) where there is a lower risk of infection. If you do so, you should still socially distance from those you do not live with, and avoid physical contact.You may attend a mosque or other place or worship, where Covid-19 Secure guidance applies, but you must socially distance from people outside of your household. This means maintaining a distance of 2 metres, or 1 metre with mitigations (such as wearing face coverings). We recommend at this time that, if possible, prayerreligious services take place outdoors.Can I still go to work in this area?Yes. People living inside and outside of this area can continue to travel in and out for work. Workplaces must implement Covid-19 Secure guidance.I live in this area. Can I still go to cafes, restaurants, the gym and other public places?Yes. But you should only go with members of your own household – even if you are going outside of the restricted area.I live in the area. Can people from outside of the lockdown area visit me at my house?No. This will be illegal.Do I still have to shield if I live in this area?Clinically extremely vulnerable people will no longer have to follow the shielding guidance from the 1 August, unless they live in Blackburn with Darwen in the North West and other local affected areas across England where shielding continues.Can I visit a care home?You should not visit friends or family in care homes, other than in exceptional circumstances. Care homes should restrict visits to these circumstances.Can I still have my wedding if it\u0027s in the lockdown area?Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies in these areas can still go ahead. No more than 30 people should attend a marriage or civil partnership, where this can be safely accommodated with social distancing in a COVID-19 secure venue. Further guidance can be found here.Large wedding receptions or parties should not currently be taking place and any celebration after the ceremony should follow the broader social distancing guidance of involving no more than two households in any location or, if outdoors, up to six people from different households.Can I travel outside of the lockdown area to attend a wedding ceremony?Yes.Can I travel into the lockdown area to attend a wedding ceremony?Yes. Weddings should be limited to no more than 30 people and subject to COVID-19 Secure guidelines.People living outside the lockdown areas may travel into the areas to attend a wedding, but should not go into a private home or garden.Can I still visit a place of worship in the lockdown area?Yes, but you must socially distance from people outside of your household. This means maintaining a distance of 2 metres, or 1 metre with mitigations (e.g. face coverings). We recommend at this time that if possible prayerreligious services take place outdoors.Can funerals still take place in the lockdown areas?Yes. Funerals should be limited to no more than 30 people and subject to COVID-19 Secure guidelines.People living outside the lockdown areas may travel into the areas to attend a funeral.Can I holiday in the lockdown area, or visit shops, leisure facilities, or cafes in it?Yes. However, you must avoid socialising with people indoors when doing so.Can I travel in a car with someone I do not live with?You should try not to share a vehicle with those outside your household or social bubble. If you need to, try to:share the transport with the same people each timekeep to small groups of people at any one timeopen windows for ventilationtravel side by side or behind other people, rather than facing them, where seating arrangements allow face away from each otherconsider seating arrangements to maximise distance between people in the vehicleclean your car between journeys using standard cleaning products – make sure you clean door handles and other areas that people may touchask the driver and passengers to wear a face coveringWhen will the lockdown be reviewed?Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said the measures would be reviewed on a weekly basis. Muslim families urged to celebrate Eid at home amid fears of coronavirus spikeNorth West of England: local restrictions - what you can and cannot do - GOV.UK"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/09/0C068B1800000578-5548741-Kate_and_Gerry_McCann_mark_the_fourth_anniversary_of_the_disappe-m-2_1524816157149.jpg","title":"Madeleine McCann suspect launches SECOND bid walk free","story":"Share this articleFall Maddie: Polizei setzt Spurensuche in Garten bei Hannover fortFall Maddie in Hannover: Ermittler finden Keller auf Gartengelände - News Inland - Bild.deMadeleine McCann cops may swoop on 2nd allotment owned by Christian B as neighbours say it’s hiding ANOTHER cellarVerdächtiger will aus dem Knast | So stehen die Chancen auf Haftentlassung - News - Bild.deMadeleine McCann suspect\u0027s neighbours fear \u0027German Maddie\u0027 is buried in cellar - Mirror Online"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80ec36a439b4199517e687be8858518ed70a1844/0_66_6328_3797/master/6328.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a11434b023d1aaf78a05a35657e080e","title":"ten years of photo reportage from libyan traffickers to mugabes zimbabwe","story":"On the French island of Porquerolles, 10 photojournalists backed by Fondation Carmignac exhibit their studies of hidden and intractable issuesTake the ferry from Hyères, on the French Riviera, to Porquerolles island, walk past the beach where Jean-Luc Godard shot the film Pierrot le Fou, wander through the government-protected, sculpture-dotted pine forest, remove your shoes and then descend to a subterranean gallery illuminated by sunbeams shimmering through a transparent swimming pool.Here, in Fondation Carmignac’s newly opened private museum, you will find a portrait of Rita. Rita was 17 when the photojournalist Lizzie Sadin photographed her. A year before, she was living with her family near the foothills of the Himalayas. A friend told her of a life of opportunity lying in wait in India, just a few hundred miles away. After crossing the border from Nepal, Rita was captured, imprisoned and forced into a life of sex work for visiting tourists. Rita’s eyes blaze into the airy calm of Porquerolles island.In 2017, Sadin, a former social worker in Paris’s périphérique, was the Carmignac photojournalism awards’ eighth winning laureate. On the basis of a two-page pitch, she received a €50,000 (£45,000) grant. She used the money to embed herself, with her camera hidden beneath her coat, in the shady dance bars of the Nepalese borderlands, capturing stories of modern-day slavery.Sadin is one of 10 photojournalists to receive such backing over the course of the last decade. To mark this milestone, Fondation Carmignac is exhibiting each laureate’s work in a retrospective titled 10 Years of Reportage, on show until 1 November 2020.With Rita’s eyes at its centre, the show is curated to urgently explore some of the biggest existential questions we face – the hidden truths of modern slavery, the cost of endless conflict, the consequences of habitat loss and the quest of freedom for those living under authoritarianism.“I came to Libya to document the humanitarian crisis of migrants trying to reach Europe through Libyan territory,” says Narciso Contreras. “But, actually, what I found is a market.”From February to June 2016, the Mexican photographer travelled through Libya after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi.He captured how Libya has become a human marketplace in which destitute migrants are bought and sold as they attempt to make their way to Europe.Contreras uses the exhibition to show the first images – taken on his iPhone – of a transaction taking place between traffickers, which helped NGO groups affiliated with Carmignac prove modern slavery was taking place in Libya.Contreras concluded that, far from trying to resolve the situation, “Libyan authorities were running, and profiting from”, the trafficking of people.Arctic: New Frontier – Yuri Kozyrev and Kadir van Lohuizen, 2018If you’re planning to visit the north pole, it might be a good idea to get a move on. On the basis of all authoritative forecasts, the ice of the Arctic will be gone by 2030, to be replaced by a water world created by anthropogenic global warming.Never before have two photojournalists simultaneously covered the irreversible changes that are taking place in the Arctic. That is until Yuri Kozyrev and Kadir van Lohuizen, working in coordination, created Arctic: New Frontier in 2018.Kozyrev followed the routes of the Russian Arctic ports, from the city of Murmansk to the Taymyr peninsula and the islands of the Russian Arctic. Van Lohuizen, meanwhile, started in the Svalbard Archipelago and followed the northern Arctic route through Greenland, Canada and the northern tip of Alaska. Each captured the expansion of the region’s ports, industrial forces and military sites – “a process that will change the map of the world forever”, Kozyrev says.The New Zealand-born photographer Robin Hammond calls Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe “a garden of Eden that became a hell to many of its inhabitants”. In the processing of taking portraits of Zimbabwe’s pro-democracy activists, Hammond was imprisoned twice. “They wanted to show me the terrible living conditions they have to endure,” he says. “But some were afraid for me, and warned me of the danger.”His portraits include the face of the activist Masvingo, staring out from a pool of darkness. Hammond hides his body, severely burnt after soldiers threw a can of lit petrol into a campaign office for Zimbabwe’s Movement for Democratic Change.Iran: Blank Pages of an Iranian Photo Album – Newsha Tavakolian, 2014In 2015, Tavakolian became the first female photographer from the Middle East to join Magnum, the photography collective. The year before, she was the Carmignac laureate for a body of work that explored, via moving and still image, the personal stories of her own generation – the Iranian millennials who have grown up in Tehran after the 1979 revolution and the country’s bloody war with Iraq.As a self-taught photographer, and when still a teenager, she took to the streets to photograph the 1999 student uprising in Iran, “spending a week scaling trees with a zoom lens” while militia marched through the streets.Her series here captures nine men and women, shot in and around Tehran, as they communicate the tension of “being marginalised by those speaking in their name”, Tavakolian says. In Iran, “they try to fit into a landscape they regard as not being their own. They, like many of the others they represent, adapt.”Seen together, the Carmignac Foundation’s retrospective is a stark reminder, in the midst of the bucolic beauty of the French Riviera, of the first world’s increasing responsibility to the poverty, oppression and vulnerability that is the daily reality for most people in this world.Carmignac Photojournalism Award: 10 Years of Reportage is on show until 1 November 2020 at Villa Carmignac, Porquerolles"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94a609aea440a248512a7b5309886c72674b2a1e/2_0_5902_3543/master/5902.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a128a16e4689d3ad7d51e7b7723f4041","title":"being inbetween girls of our time in pictures","story":"A series documenting and exploring the lives of girls aged between 10 and 12 a time of transition between girlhood and young adulthood.

But this year’s Edinburgh international book festival is offering something far more intimate: the chance of a one to one signing with a famous writer from the comfort of your armchair.After the cancellation of all the city’s summer festivals due to the coronavirus pandemic, the book festival has moved entirely online, hosting 140 book readings and, for the first time, online book signings.It has arranged signings with 22 authors based in the UK, where fans who buy the first 50 of their books will be given access to short, private signing sessions lasting about a minute, with the possibility of recording the moment.It was “an opportunity to have your online selfie with the author”, said Nick Barley, the festival’s director. “That will be a brief but fascinating interaction, we hope.” Fans will still have to queue, but in a virtual waiting room while they sit at home.The authors involved include the crime novelists Ian Rankin and Val McDermid, the novelists Ali Smith and Maggie O’Farrell, the  journalist Amelia Gentleman, the lawyer Philippe Sands and the historian Hallie Rubenhold.Barley said this may become a permanent fixture for future festivals. He said hybrid festivals, combining smaller-scale book readings held in tents in central Edinburgh with events streamed online, were likely to become the norm as audiences adapted to a post-Covid-19 world.The book festival is streaming readings online by 140 authors such as Hilary Mantel, Arundhati Roy, the 2019 Booker prize winner Bernardine Evaristo, and the former US ambassador to the UN Samantha Power.“One of the reasons we’re investing quite heavily in making this possible is because we know next year the chances of getting 800 people sitting cheek by jowl in a small theatre space in central Edinburgh are almost nil,” he said. “So the future is hybrid the future has got to be online-plus.”The readings include live events with Roy, the Indian novelist and environment campaigner, streamed via the festival’s website from Delhi, and the democracy activist Joshua Wong in Hong Kong and the Zimbabwean author Tsitsi Dangarembga.Last year’s festival involved a tented city in Charlotte Square gardens in the Georgian New Town, which along with a handful of satellite venues hosted 950 events involving nearly 900 authors.There were 250,000 visitors to Charlotte Square last year. Barley said the best comparative example for the numbers they could expect online was the 500,000 people who watched livestreamed events from the Hay book festival in May.“We do have to prepare for an almost infinite number of people watching, so we have been pretty careful to ensure the bandwidth is sufficient to cope with that. This is an experiment for us, so anything is possible,” he said.“Maybe it will produce unexpected excitements and things we don’t know we would love, but we know we will be missing what we really believe in, which is the live theatre event.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3274d612ddc62dec6edc2b854d6aff35c725f43/0_141_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81efd8dcd1bb97330036b025b3e8d8f5","title":"shuggie bain by douglas stuart review a rare and gritty debut","story":"This Booker-longlisted tale of poverty and addiction in 1980s Scotland offers deep insight into the relationship between a child and a substance-abusing parentWe first meet Shuggie Bain as a 16-year-old in 1992, living alone in a dirty bedsit on the Southside of Glasgow and working on a supermarket deli counter where his boss overlooks lapses in hygiene because underage labour is cheap. This debut novel tells us how he got here.Back to 1981 and Agnes Bain is leaning from the window of the high-rise council block where she, her second husband and her three children live “all crammed together in her mammy’s flat”. Agnes is drinking, smoking, playing cards and betting the housekeeping money with three friends, “their respite from ironing in front of the telly and heating tins of beans for ungrateful weans”. The evening degenerates until “Big Shug Bain” returns from driving his taxi and takes the other women home, returning hours later she knows what he has been doing because that’s how her own relationship with him began. Alone, Agnes remembers an early holiday together in Blackpool, Shug dragging her up the stairs of a cheap B\u0026ampB by her hair when she was too drunk to walk, raping her and then offering to take her dancing the next night.This is a story about poverty, addiction and abuse. Agnes descends through the degrading stages of alcoholism, ever more vulnerable to ever more predatory men, her only constant relationships with her children, whose knowledge of her disintegration is therefore intimate. The oldest, Catherine, marries in her late teens to get away from her mother and moves to South Africa. Alexander, “Leek”, a gifted artist who carries around with him a two-year-old letter offering him a university place, stays to try to teach Shuggie how to “act normal” – ie, appear to conform to the norms of working-class Glaswegian masculinity, which does not come naturally. He also stays in faltering hope of saving Agnes, until one day she throws him out, leaving young teenage Shuggie as her sole carer and witness.Shug senior moves the family from the urban flat to the post-industrial wasteland of a pit village, a vague and hopeless gesture towards removing Agnes from her suppliers and companions, but the landscapes of despair left by mine closures promote nothing but sickness. “The land had been turned inside out,” Stuart writes. “The black slag hills stretched for miles like the waves of a petrified sea.” Shuggie attends school in Pithead just enough to be bullied – not because of his mother’s drinking, which is common enough, but because he doesn’t move like a boy, doesn’t like football, can’t hide his fascination for hairdressing, dolls and My Little Ponies.Reading Shuggie Bain cannot but be a grim experience. Shuggie and Leek learn to undress Agnes after a night out, to look away from her bruised thighs and gouged breasts, to catch vomit and wipe bile. This is a world with no vocabulary for sexual consent men do what they do and women and boys like it or lump it. Agency flickers and goes out Catherine gets away, but Stuart signals that this offstage escape to 1980s South Africa is only participation in another form of oppression. There’s heroism in Agnes’s commitment to self-presentation and domestic order, holding on to her lipstick and tights as her liver packs up, making sure the house is immaculate before the next rapist stops by and something sadder than heroism in Shuggie’s passion for his disintegrating mother, which is not a choice but a fact. Children love their carers – that’s how abuse works.Shuggie Bain comes from a deep understanding of the relationship between a child and a substance-abusing parent, showing a world rarely portrayed in literary fiction, and to that extent it’s admirable and important. I had qualms, about Shuggie’s precocity and particularly about the depiction of women, who are all scrawny or flabby, wearing too much makeup or not enough, and whose clothes are always wrong – “tight leggings” suggest loose morals while “baggy leggings” show slovenliness. Stuart’s prose is baroque, rich in adjectives with a habit of pointing out what he’s just shown. These things are partly a matter of taste and training, but sometimes impatience with the heavy-handed prose interrupted my interest in Shuggie and Agnes.• Shuggie Bain is published by Picador (£14.99).

In fact, in her imaginary future, there would be more than one. There would also be a dog, an Aga, a pretty farmhouse surrounded by verdant hills, and, of course, a man. But there’s a saying about a goal without a plan – ultimately, it’s just a wish.Living a life of carefree chaos in a one-bed apartment off Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, and writing celebrity interviews for British magazines back home, Heawood had never been much of a planner. She definitely didn’t plan to get pregnant. Nor did she plan on moving back to London to be nearer her parents, on whom she would learn to rely all over again, or for the child’s father – whom she calls “the Musician” – to take fright and leave her to bring up their baby alone.The Hungover Games documents a six-year period in Heawood’s life where everything – her career, her body, her imagined future – turned upside down. Readers of her columns will be familiar with her adventures as a single mother adapting to her strange new existence. Here, she writes about pregnancy, childbirth and the early years of motherhood primarily as a comedy in which she is the hapless goofball, crashing from one indignity to the next. But woven into the sprightly prose and self-mocking humour are moments of painful truth and profundity.We meet her as she accompanies a friend to a wellness ranch in Mexico, where rich Californians go to have massages, do yoga and say “namaste” a lot. After a week of classes, Heawood was in physical pain, which she imagined was par for the course, but then the pain continued all the way to hospital where she was told a vertebra had come loose from her spinal column. She also learned that the polycystic ovary syndrome she had in her 20s meant that she would now be unable to conceive without fertility treatment.She spent a week crying, furious with herself for “thinking that I could go back and make a family later, that I could work out how to make a relationship with a nice man later, just because I thought I was supposed to mess everything up a few times first”. But then, over lunch, her friend Mal pointed out that she could still get pregnant, just not by accident, and told her to go out and celebrate by “fucking like it’s the 1970s”. And that, writes Heawood, “is the story of how I didn’t use a condom the next time I had sex, which would turn out to be, as it happened, the very next day”.Heawood knew something was up a few weeks later when she didn’t want to go out. Then the actor Amy Adams said something to her during an interview about how her mind and body had been “united in ambition for once” during pregnancy, allowing her to push through her to-do list. As Heawood noticed she was “sober and ploughing through my to-do lists like never before”, the penny finally dropped. Awkward conversations ensued, with friends, family and, most grimly, with the Musician. She moved back to east London and built her new life in a small rented house nestled behind a kebab shop, a jerk chicken takeaway, a McDonald’s and a Greggs (“the four main food groups”), and downwind of a tiny street known locally as Piss Alley.Publishing is awash with accounts of pregnancy and parenting, though few are seen through the lens of single motherhood and fewer still are as sharply observed and funny. She recalls the antenatal classes in which husbands and boyfriends are taught how to give their pregnant partners back rubs, and which leave her “feeling like the extra prick at the wedding. Except that the two things I demonstrably lacked were a) a prick and b) a wedding.” Early in her second trimester, Heawood spends an evening at a restaurant discussing her pregnancy with friends and allowing them to stroke her suddenly visible bump. In the toilets, she lets out a fart that “must have been audible in the underground caves the Taliban were using in the Peshawar mountain range”, and realises that everyone was rubbing a bulge caused by trapped wind.Elsewhere, there are indecently entertaining tales of meeting Osama bin Laden’s niece in a basement bar giving a Hare Krishna escapee his first blowjob and a first date with a kind man who ends up smothered in baby sick. Eye-watering candour is Heawood’s default setting. Not for nothing does she simultaneously dedicate the book to her mother and daughter, while gently entreating them never to read it.Outrageous anecdotes frequently make way for poignancy and reflection, however. Most affecting is the tenderness with which she writes about her daughter who becomes her “diminutive partner in crime, and in beauty, and in fart jokes”. Life may not have turned out the way the author imagined, but her book is far from a chronicle of regret. The Hungover Games is about embracing the chaos and finding love where you didn’t know it existed. And the love depicted here is beautiful. “I want to be the safe place my daughter turns to at night, and wakes up to in the morning,” Heawood writes. “The safe harbour. Unconditional. Not everyone gets one of those.”• The Hungover Games is published by Jonathan Cape (£14.99). To order a copy go to bookshop.

And it is important to note that no decisions or commitments have been made at this stage.”Horta-Osório said the staff survey would influence an existing plan to consolidate its office footprint into six strategic hubs across the UK, focusing on London, Scotland, West Yorkshire, and the north-west, West Midlands and the south-west.“We will be working to understand what the future of work and the office looks like which will also help to inform our decision,” he added.Horta-Osório’s comments come a day after Jes Staley, the chief executive of rival Barclays, said his bank was also reviewing its property footprint after seeing how 30,000 of its 50,000 UK staff have been able to work from home effectively during the coronavirus crisis.“We’ve all learned a lot in the last couple of months about the dynamic work environment and it’s extraordinary that we’re running a bank of the complexity of Barclays with over 60,000 people working from their kitchen tables,” Staley said. “We are going to think about our real estate mix, given the lessons that we’ve learned.”In April, Staley made headlines after declaring the days of putting 7,000 people into a single building “may be a thing of the past”.However, on Thursday, he stressed the importance of getting staff together physically to improve culture and promote collaboration. He said the bank would continue to operate in hubs including Manchester, Glasgow and London.“It will be fascinating to see how it evolves over the next couple of years … but we’ll still have a major presence in places like Canary Wharf and other locations,” Staley said.The bank refused to comment on reports it was considering terminating its lease for its building in North Colonnade, Canary Wharf, in an attempt to cut rent costs.The move would involve shifting its investment bankers to the lender’s Canary Wharf headquarters based in Churchill Place, which houses 7,000 staff. The Times, which first reported the potential move, said it would involve a shift to permanent homeworking for some staff."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01253534e20f84cd037fe2e8f2e7593ee2bf3fe0/157_468_5816_3490/master/5816.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c842ec4916738bf4f019dcc4caa3a358","title":"british airways owner iag record loss covid 19","story":"IAG, the owner of British Airways, is to raise €2.75bn (£2.49bn) to strengthen its balance sheet after reporting a record loss in the second quarter as the coronavirus pandemic continues to hammer the travel market.Willie Walsh, IAG’s chief executive, expects it to take until at least 2023 for passenger demand to reach the pre-coronavirus levels of 2019.“All IAG airlines made substantial losses,” Walsh said. “Each airline has taken actions to adjust their business and reduce their cost base to reflect forecast demand in their markets.”The group is asking investors to back a €2.75bn equity raising and has already secured the support of its largest shareholder, Qatar Airways.“This will enhance the group’s resilience, balance sheet and liquidity position,” Walsh said. Total operating losses for the group, including exceptional costs relating to the early retirement of British Airways’ Boeing 747s and Iberia’s Airbus A340s, came to €2.2bn.“We are nowhere close to where we had hoped to be as a result of the continuing restrictions that government has introduced,” said Walsh, speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.Walsh said he expected an increase in these numbers when restrictions were lifted.“Domestic markets recover much more quickly than international markets,” he said. “When restrictions are removed there is very clear evidence of pent-up demand and passengers do start flying again.”He added that the quarantine restrictions introduced for travellers flying to Spain had not discouraged customers flying to other parts of Europe.The group has so far refunded more than £1bn to customers but Walsh admitted it could have moved more quickly. “It is important for us to acknowledge that we have disappointed people and not been able to refund people as quickly as we would like,” he said. “The scale of this challenge goes beyond anything we have seen before and we just weren’t prepared for it.

Think of Alan Shearer’s Premier League goals, Wilt Chamberlain’s 100 point basketball game, Eddy Merckx’s victories in cycling. The second quarter eurozone GDP figure should probably go on that list as well it would be great if it were never to be beaten.Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, a consultancy, said: There are few silver linings in the data published today, which confirm that euro-zone GDP slumped just as much as feared in the second quarter and that inflation remained well below target. While parts of the economy have sprung back to life over the past couple of months, the damage already done combined with the current and potential future impact of the virus mean that the recovery will be painfully slow. Spain, which has suffered one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks worldwide, also saw the deepest contraction in the second quarter among eurozone nations.The deepest GDP fall since time series started in 1995 coincided with Covid-19-induced lockdowns that began to ease in many eurozone countries only from May.There are some more notes of caution on the house price rise from economists.It is easy to see why some expect prices to drop again, given the unemployment surge expected by many. Here is a measure of house price affordability for UK workers: the drop during the financial crisis is evident, but so far there is little sign of a much deeper recession.The UK housing market is a strange beast, with the added complication of foreign speculative flows - although this crisis might conceivably affect buyers from abroad.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said:Meanwhile, the supply of homes coming on to the market likely will increase in the winter, once mortgage payment holidays of up to six months for struggling households come to an end, pushing some into forced sales.Some striking data on UK house prices this morning: British house prices jumped the highest in 11 years this month, according to Nationwide’s house price index.The end of lockdown appears to have unleashed some pent-up demand, and stamp duty cuts are expected to add further support in the coming months.The bounce back in prices reflects the unexpectedly rapid recovery in housing market activity since the easing of lockdown restrictions. The rebound in activity reflects a number of factors. Pent up demand is coming through, where decisions taken to move before lockdown are progressing. Behavioural shifts may be boosting activity, as people reassess their housing needs and preferences as a result of life in lockdown. Moreover, social distancing does not appear to be having as much of a chilling effect as we might have feared, at least at this stage. These trends look set to continue in the near term, further boosted by the recently announced stamp duty holiday, which will serve to bring some activity forward. But also a warning:However, there is a risk this proves to be something of a false dawn. Most forecasters expect labour market conditions to weaken significantly in the quarters ahead as a result of the aftereffects of the pandemic and as government support schemes wind down. If this comes to pass, it would likely dampen housing activity once again in the quarters ahead.The FTSE 100 is trundling along, as might be expected in late July (even if we do have a fair few dramatic company results to contend with).Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said:Tobacco, banks and media have been the worst performing FTSE 350 sectors in July. Here are the full stories for two of the big issues this morning: NatWest’s massive loan impairment and British Airways owner IAG’s even bigger fundraising effort.Another eurozone GDP reading: Italy was already in recession, but now it is officially the worst since at least the second world war.But the quarterly slump in the eurozone’s third-largest economy was still “unprecedented”, national statistics bureau ISTAT said.Chief Executive Philip Jansen said BT delivered a strong operating performance in the quarter, when millions relied on its networks for home working and schooling, and produced “relatively resilient” financial results.He said the company, which pulled its idend in May to help weather the unfolding health crisis, had enough visibility to provide guidance for the year. “Despite our strong operational performance in the first three months of the year, it is clear that Covid-19 will continue to impact our business as the full economic consequences unfold,” he said.And more details from Jansen’s call with media:Another thing to add to the eurozone GDP pot that we missed from earlier: we have already had French growth (or should that be contraction?) figures this morning - but there is a silver lining.Consumer spending rose to pre-pandemic levels to ease some of the pain for the quarter. Losses at digital bank Monzo ballooned to £114m, as the bank warned that the financial strain of the Covid-19 crisis had put the company’s future at risk.The London-based bank said its revenues had been “significantly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic” and its economic impact. Along with stricter regulations meant to combat financial crime, it could result in lower customer numbers, higher costs and lower revenue.This increases the risk that the group will not be able to execute its business plan, which could adversely impact its ability to generate a profit or raise sufficient capital to meet future regulatory capital requirements.Due to these obstacles, the directors recognise there are material uncertainties that cast significant doubt upon the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.It came as the bank, known for its hot coral pink cards, reported an annual loss of £114m for the year to February 2020. That is more than double the £50m loss the bank logged a year earlier. British Airways owners IAG has said it plans to raise €2.75bn (£2.5bn) from shareholders as it tries to shore up its finances amid longer-than-expected disruption.The group said on Friday that it had made a second quarter loss of €2bn, compared to a 2019 profit of €806m.Willie Walsh, still IAG’s chief executive after delaying his retirement, said:Our industry is facing an unprecedented crisis and the outlook remains uncertain. However, we strongly believe that now is the time to look to the future and strengthen IAG’s financial and strategic position.While we have had to make tough decisions on both people and costs, these actions are the right ones to protect as many jobs and serve as many customers as feasible and put IAG in the strongest position possible. The industry will recover from this crisis, though we do not expect this to be before 2023, and there will be opportunities for IAG to capitalise on its strength and leadership positions.Aside from the GDP data, today marks another installment of the company earnings bonanza we have seen this week. We will run through some of those now.First up, NatWest, the artist formerly known as Royal Bank of Scotland, has matched its peers by putting aside billions of pounds to cover coronavirus loan losses, tipping it to a loss for the second quarter.NatWest tumbled into the red by £1.3bn in the second quarter, as it stashed away another £2.1bn to cover bad debts caused by the coronavirus crisis. Preparations for a further downturn wiped out profits at the taxpayer-owned lender, which reported a £1.7bn profit during the same period last year.Its earnings were stung by a £2.1bn loan loss provision to cover a jump in defaults in the coming months, as businesses and households struggle to repay their debts because of the economic slump triggered by the coronavirus outbreak. Analysts had expected a second-quarter charge of £943m.NatWest said the impairment charge – which brings total provisions so far this year to £2.9bn – “reflected the deterioration of the economic outlook”. Full-year loan loss charges are expected to total £3.5bn-£4.5bn.European stock markets have gained at the opening bell.Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics, the eurozone and financial markets on a fine summer’s day across much of the UK.Economists are not the only ones who could tell you that economic activity has stalled in most major economies because of the coronavirus pandemic, but today they will give a first view of exactly how bad the picture is for the eurozone economy, with the first estimate of GDP growth for the second quarter.US tech companies on Thursday evening revealed phenomenal financial results (a day after receiving blows from members of US Congress over antitrust concerns). Futures for Wall Street’s main stock market indices point to a positive open after Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google-owner Alphabet all benefited from the work-from-home orders to beat earnings estimates.Depending on movements over the course of today the US dollar could also record its worst month in a decade. Investors bought the greenback in droves early in the crisis, but they have since sold it off as the realisation has seeped through that the Federal Reserve will not be in a mood to tighten monetary policy (boosting the relative value fo the dollar) any time soon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5ac90447cf539e022c612ed87d313ac4aaca13a/0_193_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0940896d9b16f31138c616b726153dae","title":"algeria apology reparations france history emmanuel macron","story":"Emmanuel Macron has set a historian to investigate colonial brutality – but yet more evidence is no substitute for actionClarifying the past is a notoriously difficult task at the best of times, but exceptionally so in relation to the intensely bloody history of Algeria.France, its former coloniser, has a long record of covering up the atrocities it committed, so the facts are frequently disputed. This has prolonged anger and resentment among the victims of an imperial adventure that continues to ide the two nations.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, wants to change all this, and has appointed a renowned Paris university professor to shed light on “the memory of colonisation and the Algerian war” by the end of this year. Benjamin Stora’s ultimate objective will be to illuminate the horror of what went on during the 132 years of conquest that started in 1830, but also to help bring about “reconciliation between the French and Algerian peoples”, reads a particularly ambitious Élysée Palace statement.Macron is the first French head of state to address this scandalously neglected issue since the country’s defeat at the hands of Algerian nationalists in 1962, telling journalists on a trip back from Israel earlier this year: “The Algerian war is today absent from our political memory and the subject of a conflict of memories like the Holocaust was.” He added, “We don’t talk about this. We crush it.”However, Algerian communities in France, as well as in Algeria, are by no means convinced that rapprochement is so close at hand. This is because their collective memory is informed by the hardship that has persisted long after freedom.When victory was achieved after the nearly eight-year Algerian war of independence, the winning forces claimed some 1.5 million Algerians had been killed. The dead ranged from men, women and children obliterated by napalm or in caves used as improvised gas chambers to Algerian separatists drowned or clubbed to death by Paris police following round-ups in the French capital.Unlike British India, the jewel in the crown of the French empire was an actual part of France. Algeria had its own départements – the Gallic equivalent of counties – and its settler colonialists, the so-called Pieds-Noirs (“black feet”), returned MPs to the National Assembly in Paris.In turn, the Pieds-Noirs nostalgia remains strong in the Rassemblement National (National Rally) – the far-right party founded as the Front National by Jean-Marie Le Pen, the convicted racist and Holocaust denier, who has been linked to acts of torture while serving as a soldier in Algeria. He denies all allegations of involvement in torture. Profound antipathy towards north Africans, and indeed Islam, is still a huge part of the movement’s politics. Like so many others, they maintain a colonial view of dark-skinned Arab Muslims, who they do not consider as French.In this sense, the Algeria question is about so much more than the war – it has come to define the nature of modern France, and particularly its prejudices and inequalities.Macron is an astute politician, and it could be argued that his attempt to resolve outstanding grievances simply represents electioneering, with the head of state hoping to win over French-Algerian voters before he runs for a second term in 2022.Stora, his chosen historian, is a highly rated academic with an outstanding record of research into north African affairs, but he is based in France, and – just as significantly – is not an Algerian. On the contrary, he is from a Pieds-Noirs settler background. His birthplace is Constantine, near which some 45,000 Algerian civilians were massacred by the French during disturbances in May 1945.Having spoken to Macron about war and memory, I am convinced that he wants to make his mark on Franco-Algerian relations. Coming from the Somme region, he is acutely sensitive to how the world wars are constantly commemorated, but not colonial ones. Just before his election in 2017, Macron stated that there were “crimes and acts of barbarism” in Algeria that would nowadays be prosecuted as “crimes against humanity”.This in itself was a stark acknowledgment of the extent of the French savagery, suggesting that the next obvious step would be an apology and indeed reparations. Court convictions could certainly be achieved.France did not own up to its collaboration in the Holocaust until 1995, when then-president Jacques Chirac formally admitted and apologised for the role his countrymen had played in sending Jews to their deaths in Nazi concentration camps.Macron already has plenty of evidence highlighting the evil nature of l’Algérie française. Academically rehearsing what we know won’t achieve much. If anything, it could exacerbate grievances. What is needed are an apology, reparations and – yes – even prosecutions.• Nabila Ramdani is a Paris-born journalist and academic of Algerian descent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/817f0f2fa655ef5e2e6d227d67c000818c972483/0_73_5131_3079/master/5131.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=9e874818709f7f27ac68ef329e252053","title":"brave new worlds what can we learn from films utopian visions","story":"From eco fantasies to dystopian nightmares, cinema has long explored how life might be different. Our post-lockdown existence could look to them for pointers As we emerge blinking into the sunlight after lockdown, many of us will be daring to dream of a more harmonious, ecological future. It’s what the subjects of Spaceship Earth were hoping to create when they locked down voluntarily for two years as part of an experiment around communal, self-sufficient living. The new documentary tells the story of Biosphere 2, an Earth system science research facility located in the Arizona desert. Back in 1991, eight people moved into the huge vivarium as a dress rehearsal in case humans had to repopulate to Mars. Matt Wolf’s film is a fascinating watch that vividly recalls classic sci-fi cinema: the “biospherians” wear designer space suits and their mission references 1972’s Silent Running, in which a botanist astronaut tries to save a biosystem orbiting in space.It begs the question: what other lessons can we learn from sci-fi movies, post lockdown? In the past, many films have depicted a post-apocalyptic world where artificial communities have been created in an attempt to save at least some of the planet. But these are rarely truly happy places. In the family animation WALL-E (2008), lazy humans live on starliners, having trashed the Earth. A seemingly harmonious world conceals hidden horrors in Logan’s Run, the 1973 film with an upcoming remake.Utopias that turn dystopian are common in cinema, as noted by the novelist and critic Kim Newman: “The first act shows you everyone having a good time, but you notice the cracks. Then you learn how terrible things really are.” Many fictional future worlds are ided between rich and poor, such as polis (1927) and Soylent Green (1973). Others can be threatened by one bad egg. Comic-book adaptations are full of these, from Loki in the Thor series to Killmonger in Black Panther. Wonder Woman’s Themyscira is disrupted by the arrival of men.More recently, the young adult genre has been dominated by pure dystopias: children were forced to hunt and kill each other in the Hunger Games series (2012-2015). The 2015 Disney film Tomorrowland struck a more optimistic note, depicting a secret world built by “all the geniuses, the artists, the scientists, the smartest, most creative people … in a place free from politics and bureaucracy, distractions, greed”. Brad Bird’s film directly addressed the subject of how we respond to dystopian images: inventor David Nix (Hugh Laurie) tried to warn humanity by broadcasting images of impending doom. “They didn’t fear their demise, they repackaged it!” he laments. “It can be enjoyed as video games, as TV shows, books, movies – the entire world wholeheartedly embraced the apocalypse, and sprinted towards it with gleeful abandon.” But hopeful heroine Casey (Britt Robertson) still went in search of “dreamers” to build a better future.Such optimism is reminiscent of Spaceship Earth. Far from being stereotypical hippies, the members of this commune built a huge houseboat to travel the world, forging partnerships with likeminded financiers. They formed a theatre company and performed avant-garde shows. They wanted to see if self-sufficient life was possible on Mars, so they tried it – or at least, as close as they could get. Not everything in the garden was rosy, but at least it grew.The idea of a contained, peaceful community is prevalent in onscreen utopias. Newman describes these as being, “collectivist, contemplative … with tamed natural spaces”. Biospherian Mark Nelson, however, finds few of them are believable. “I and other biospherians would laugh, because in almost all science fiction movies, there are hardly any green plants or other lifeforms around – yet no one asks: ‘How are they getting their oxygen, water regeneration, clean food?’”Silent Running does emphasise the difference between fresh, locally grown food and bland, artificial meals, while Soylent Green takes the idea to a more sinister extreme. Meanwhile veganism – on the rise in real life – features in several onscreen utopias. Simon Amstell’s pointed TV mockumentary, Carnage, painted a picture of a harmonious, sustainable future where the only pain was the memory of their elders murdering animals.A plant-based diet also features in the cult French comedy La Belle Verte (The Green Beautiful, 1996). Writer-director Coline Serreau plays Mila, an alien from a utopian community who comes to 90s Paris and is comically horrified by the pollution, smoking, meat eating and overcrowding. La Belle Verte’s farcical humour eases into a strong message about a self-sufficient community with no leaders, where the days consist of strengthening acrobatic play and exercises in telepathy. All inhabitants work the land and agree on population control (“After the harvest, we decide how many babies to make”). It turns out that their lives used to look much like ours on Earth.I asked Jennifer Wells, a professor at the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco, and member-at-large of the Society of Utopian Studies, what she thought of La Grande Verte. “Serreau evokes a foreign utopian planet with ecological lifestyles, spiritual harmony, zero carbon technologies and equality,” she says. “This ideal society on a far-off planet may not be realisable – unless we are getting close to switching out cell phones for telepathy, and football for group ballet.”She adds: “What is realisable is the deeper questioning that comes up when Mila visits Earth. Through Mila’s hilarious escapades, we get a fresh view on how some of the things we accept as most normal are, in fact, in need of transformation.”This “fresh view” chimes with the lockdown experience: not only have more people started growing their own vegetables, but they have had the space to take a long look at their lives and the world – much like biospherians. Nelson says: “Since we experienced the metabolic connection we had to our mini-world so bodily and viscerally, when we came out, we were eager to share that insight – every human’s very life depends on Earth’s biosphere!” He sees clear parallels with the current crisis. “This pandemic lockdown can be a shock point for people to realise how vital a healthy biosphere is for them. Help make your city greener and less polluted connect with your neighbours, your community, the trees, birds and natural elements around you.”Spaceship Earth’s director agrees. “In light of Covid-19, we have all been living like biospherians, and we are now re-entering a different world,” says Wolf. “The question is: how will we be transformed, and how might that compel us to reimagine our world?”Perhaps film-makers can inspire us. Jude Law has been cast as an architect building a utopia in Francis Ford Coppola’s long-planned Megalopolis, while screenwriter Caitlin Moran (How to Build a Girl) recently revealed she is writing “a cheerful utopian sci fi movie”. That’s something I’d welcome: La Belle Verte is the only sci-fi movie I have watched recently that didn’t give me nightmares. In fact, I woke energised and inspired. After the darkness, maybe a positive vision is what tomorrow’s dreamers need.• Anna Smith is a film critic and host of the Girls on Film podcast.

Spiegel’s source, Rui Pinto, who is charged with computer hacking in his native Portugal, which he denies, has denied that he obtained the emails by criminal means.City have vehemently denied that the Etihad sponsorship was subsidised by the club’s owner, Sheikh Mansour of the Abu Dhabi ruling family, or any other Abu Dhabi entity, since Spiegel first published the emails, and throughout the subsequent investigation and ultimate guilty finding by Uefa’s Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) adjudicatory chamber (AC). Pearce and senior Etihad executives gave evidence at the Cas hearing, categorically denying the finding, largely based on the published emails, that the airline did not pay the sponsorships in full.The emails considered by the CFCB and Cas included three from City’s then financial officers to Pearce, a City board member and senior adviser on the Executive Affairs Authority (EAA), a strategic Abu Dhabi government authority. The finance officers set out that in 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2015-16 Etihad paid only £8m of sponsorship deals City stated to be £35m, £65m and £67.5m respectively. The rest, they wrote, was being paid by Mansour’s company ownership vehicle, the Abu Dhabi United Group (ADUG).City had refused requests from the CFCB for Pearce and other senior people to give evidence, and Cas severely criticised the club and imposed a €10m (£9m) fine for their failure to cooperate and obstruction of the investigation. Pearce did appear before Cas, as did James Hogan, the former Etihad chief executive, and other senior figures, and based largely on their evidence, the Cas panel overturned by a 2-1 majority the CFCB conclusion that Mansour “disguised” his own funding as Etihad sponsorship.Spiegel published the new emails two days after Cas released the full 93-page judgment that detailed its reasons.One of the new emails was sent by Pearce in December 2013, from his Executive Affairs Authority address to Peter Baumgartner, then Etihad’s chief commercial officer, with the subject “payments”. Pearce set out that under its sponsorship agreement Etihad had owed City £31.5m for the 2012-13 season, and £67.5m for the £2013-14 season, a total of £99m.“So we should be receiving a total of £99m – of which you will provide £8m,” he wrote to Baumgartner. ”I therefore should have forwarded £91m and instead have sent you only £88.5m. I effectively owe you £2.5m.”Pearce offered Baumgartner two options to reconcile the missing £2.5m. The first was for Etihad to pay only £65m of the £67.5m sponsorship for 2013-14 and pay the £2.5m the following year. The second option, Pearce wrote, was: “You pay the £65m now and I will forward the £2.5m in a couple of months – at which point you can forward it on.”Pearce apologised to Baumgartner for the missing £2.5m he had not sent, writing: “As I am sure you knew, embarrassingly it would seem that rather than overpaying you I have underpaid you!”The figure of £88.5m Pearce apparently sent to Etihad for forwarding to City tallies with the same figure, £88.5m, set out to Pearce in one of the previously published emails. That was sent five days earlier by Jorge Chumillas, City’s then chief financial officer, who said the breakdown of Etihad’s sponsorship of City was £88.5m from ADUG, while Etihad was paying £8m.Pearce’s evidence to Cas about the City’s finance officers writing in their emails that only £8m was coming from Etihad, was that the arrangements had caused “some confusion among iniduals at the club” and “a misunderstanding that ADUG was making funds available to Etihad”.City declined to provide a response to the contents of the new emails, as they did publicly in 2018, so they did not explain why or in what capacity Pearce was apparently sending £91m to the chief commercial officer of Etihad for its sponsorship of City.The club said in a statement: “The questions and matters raised by Der Spiegel appear to be a cynical attempt to publicly re-litigate and undermine a case that has been fully adjudicated, after detailed proceedings and due process, by the court of arbitration for sport.“Manchester City’s policy remains not to comment on out of context materials purported to have been criminally obtained from City Football Group and Manchester City personnel.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/891d0a67418d6c94ae3673cf0071b1c999b11657/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83bafa3e8f2714e57f1ac19b3eb87300","title":"kale to kimchi 12 foods that are good for gut health","story":"The contents of your shopping basket can have a huge impact on your wellbeing, so stock up on the items which can help to promote digestion and a healthy gutWe’ve probably never been more aware of how the groceries we choose impact on our health. Who among us hasn’t tried to resist the lure of the cake aisle? The connection between food and wellbeing seems particularly salient when it comes to gut health. And, it turns out, by making simple changes to our diet, we can start to take care of our tummies. Try popping some of the items listed below into your shopping basket and see if you notice a difference.Potatoes Pile plenty of potatoes into your shopping bag, but resist peeling them because their skins contain fibre. Fibre helps to maintain a healthy digestive system, passing through our small intestine without being broken down. The UK government recommends we aim for 30g of fibre a day although British adults manage to eat only around 19g on average. Potatoes are also a source of resistant starch, a form of starch that can’t be digested in the small intestine and so is classified as a type of fibre. This, too, may aid gut health.WholegrainsChoosing wholegrain varieties of bread and pasta is an easy way of boosting your fibre intake. Unlike the refined grains used in white bread and pasta, whole grains include the bran, the fibre-rich outer layer that gets stripped when grain is refined. Remember to check the label on any packets you buy so you can be sure about the ingredients, fibre content and nutritional values. European regulations state that a product claiming to be a source of fibre should contain at least 3g of fibre per 100g or at least 1.5g of fibre per 100 kcal, while a product claiming to be high fibre should contain double those figures.Wheat bran A daily intake of 10g of wheat-bran fibre is known to support your gut health by helping to accelerate the transit of food through your intestines. An easy way to boost your intake is by eating breakfast cereals high in wheat-bran fibre, such as the Kellogg’s high fibre range, which includes Bran Flakes, All-Bran Original and Fruit \u0026amp Fibre.Oats These are another handy breakfast option. Oats are known to provide a type of fibre often referred to as soluble fibre. This fibre dissolves in water and forms a gel in the gut, which can beneficially impact digestion and metabolism. Remember oats aren’t just used to make porridge but are the basis of muesli, oatcakes and oat bread.Leafy vegetables Parents down the generations have told children to “eat up your greens”, and it turns out they were right. For example, broccoli and kale can provide a source of fibre.Probiotics and fermented foods We can enrich the ersity of our gut microbiome by eating probiotics – technically defined as live bacteria that, when consumed in a viable form and adequate amounts, are beneficial to health. Kefir, a fermented milk drink, is an example of a food providing a probiotic source. Such foods may complement a fibre-rich diet, in the context of gut health. Other fermented foods such as certain yoghurts, sauerkraut, miso and kimchi are examples of probiotic sources.Bulgur wheatIf you’re bored of potatoes but need something on the side, this wholewheat grain is your friend. It comes in four sizes, from fine to very coarse, and is great as a basis for salads. Mix it with anything from tomatoes and cucumber to parsley and lettuce, for a tasty side dish.PulsesThese come in all sorts of varieties, with some of the most familiar being lentils, chickpeas and kidney beans. All three contain fibre, as well as resistant starch, and can be added to soups, stews, curries or salads.Nuts and seedsPumpkin, sunflower and flax seeds are handy if you’re looking for a fibre snack while on the go. Nuts and seeds can be sprinkled on stir fries, blitzed into curries, stirred into homemade cereal bars, or added to breakfast cereals. And don’t forget nut butters, which come in varieties such as cashew and almond as well as peanut.Assorted fruitsIf you fancy something sweeter, remember that plenty of fruits contain fibre, such as strawberries, blackberries and pomegranates. Avocados might be savoury but they are a fruit, and another good option.BananasWhen green, these are a good source of resistant starch. As a rule of thumb, the greener the banana, the more resistant starch it contains, so try to eat them before they turn completely yellow.PrebioticsFibre reaches the large intestine undigested. Once there, some types of fibre become “food” for the good bacteria in our gut. These types of fibre are referred to as prebiotics. Small amounts can be found in foods such as chicory root, onions, garlic and artichokes. But you can also opt for foods with added prebiotic fibre."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b473ddf12486a48df79edc79336b9da1ddb50475/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c64d254b4a65ad0ee81b15a92a6965c","title":"we realised we were a necessity how a high street baker used google to keep serving his community","story":"For Sam Mensah of London bakery Uncle John’s, the right digital ingredients equipped his business to rise to the challenge during lockdownThe bright yellow signage of Uncle John’s Bakery stands out like a beacon on West Green Road, in the north London suburb of Tottenham. Famed for its lovingly made Ghanaian sweet bread and other regional specialties such as drop doughnuts and meat pies, the bakery has served London’s African-Caribbean and wider community for 25 years.Sam Mensah took over the family business in 2015. “When my parents came to Britain in 1982, they had nothing behind them education-wise, but they were ready to seize the opportunities life in the UK could provide,” he recounts.“They longed for the comfort of Ghanaian sweet bread, but the available imports were stale on arrival. So they started baking their own, to a family recipe, using somebody else’s bakery after midnight. Soon they started selling it by word of mouth. Then they had it packaged, placing it in Ghanaian shops. Eventually they built up enough momentum to open a shop of their own.“It wasn’t always easy, but whenever things looked bleak, my mum reminded my dad of a Ghanaian motto: obeyeyie – things will get better. I think – and especially now, when people might feel like they need to give up on things – you have to have resilience.”Resilience and persistence is clearly baked into the family DNA, as Mensah too proved when he set aside a successful music career to take over running Uncle John’s from his ageing parents. Tackling a steep learning curve, he not only added two new production units and gained the certifications needed to be able to supply supermarkets, but also comprehensively rebranded the store and built up a digital and social media presence.And as the UK went into lockdown in March, it was this spirit of resilience that made all the difference. Mensah says he did have a moment of panic: “We closed the store for a couple of days. Then we realised the wholesale side was moving fast and that we were a necessity – that people will buy our bread. So we reopened, putting measures in place to protect our staff, and publicised our new opening times on social channels, and above all, on Google My Business.”Using Google My Business – a free tool for businesses to manage their online presence across Google, including updating opening times on Search and Maps - meant customers could not only see the bakery’s new hours of business, but also that online ordering was available, either for pickup, or for delivery within an eight-mile radius. Uncle John’s also delivered flour – a hot commodity at the peak of the lockdown.If luck is when preparedness and opportunity meet, Mensah had the perfect package at just the right time: an optimised website with Google Maps integration, a strong social media presence, and an informative Google My Business profile. Positive Google reviews further buttressed his credibility, reassuring first-time customers. With all the pieces coming together, what could have been a crisis became a springboard for further growth.Mensah is clear what a lifeline it has proved to be: “With Google My Business, we have been able to communicate our business’ adaptations during this current pandemic, and helped bridge the gap between our business and consumers by keeping customers informed. And in turn, through reviews, we are able to understand what the customer wants and adjust accordingly.”And the effects go well beyond his premises Mensah was also able to publicise his NHS initiative – priority service and free loaves for NHS staff. “Serving our community at this time is more important than ever,” he says. “We’ve given out more than 2,000 loaves so far.”In fact, this community ethos was what drove Mensah to take over the family business in the first place: “What really helped me make that decision was having a daughter of my own. I wanted her to see what legacy is about. I felt that this business was something very important within the community, and for the generation that comes after me.”For Mensah, the way forward is now clearer than ever. “Our goal is to stand our ground among all British companies, not just black businesses,” he says. “And it’s no longer just for us. It’s for all the people who are placing their trust in us.”To find out how Google can help your business adapt, visit: g.cosmallbusiness"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ee80b9b2eb8b3ccf489dec2d1ac1816bf1e9bc5/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=eb017ae02bcb9a0ad7c70773797801b5","title":"dominic fike what could possibly go wrong review","story":"(Columbia)Fike’s star is in the ascendant, thanks to a guileless, summery blend of rap, rock and popFew young artists can boast of sparking a label bidding war after releasing their debut EP through Soundcloud, or list the likes of Brockhampton, Billie Eilish and DJ Khaled as fans. Yet Dominic Fike’s beachy, lo-fi blend of rap and soft rock made him an instant star, with his debut single, 3 Nights, going platinum in the US and the UK.Partially that’s because his genre-fluid ethos taps into a sound established by Post Malone and the late Juice WRLD. He’s not yet at their level: What Could Possibly Go Wrong whiplashes between genres in a way that is sometimes messy and mismatched. Yet Fike’s versatility deserves credit – it’s hard not to enjoy the grungy, knotted production of Come Here, as well as the California pop rock of Double Negative (Skeleton Milkshake). Despite the blend of genres, Fike does have a clear signature sound. Muffled vocals, gritty guitar riffs and heavy percussion ring through What’s for Dinner? and Joe Blazey, overlaid by Fike’s high-pitched singing and melodic rap. His lyricism and song content might occasionally come off as banal and vapid (Cancel Me is weakly antagonistic), but it’s lifted by his often vibrant flow and instrumentation that harness a sense of sunny, youthful optimism.That guilelessness is key: What Could Possibly Go Wrong will be a summer soundtrack for the 24-year-old’s Gen Z fanbase who, like Fike, feel carefree in the moment yet nihilistic about their future. It offers insight into the untrammelled spirit of an artist on the rise, one reassuringly unencumbered by expectations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f7fa25ad9c04b582ba8bb43d1cbb2ad28ddfb0d/0_0_6944_4167/master/6944.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12dc1f3930ba48bd8251a3520af77a92","title":"iamddbs fantasy festival rihannas got to be there shes a buff ting","story":"The Manchester rapper imagines 48 hours in Ibiza surrounded by Black Coffee, Megan Thee Stallion and her own octopus recipeDefinitely Ibiza. The beaches, weather, vibe and people are just so correct. People need to experience a hot country that has the energy that Ibiza has. It’s my favourite place in the world – I’ve spent holidays there raving, and it’s beautiful. I’d make it a 48-hour festival that doesn’t stop I feel like people don’t really rave like that any more. Just imagine: 48 hours of it just being dirty and people catching a vibe, acts just one after the other. It would be crazy!I’d have a tropical artist such as Black Coffee. You need someone from South Africa, the music and the energy there is just different. The sound from that country makes you feel warm, free and sensual. Black Coffee can bring that sound to a festival. I’d go for a DJ more than an artist to headline, to be honest, because every great live music experience I’ve had has been with DJs. I don’t know what it is about the connection that you have with the instrumentation of the music at DJ sets, it just hits different. I want to give DJs a space where they can shine.I’d want it to be all females here. I haven’t actually seen any of these artists live, I’m picking them based off their vibes, the quality of their work, and how they carry themselves. I’d have Blond:ish, she’s super dope – if I’m doing something in Ibiza she’s got to be there, her DJ sets are just insane. I’d have to have Megan thee Stallion – she’s a bad bitch. I love everything she represents I love how in her power she is. She’s unapologetic, she’s sassy and she shows it. I really rate it, and the vibe she creates. I know she’ll create the best mood, and I fuck with that heavy, she’s just a beautiful black woman.Ace Tee is another artist I’d have perform. She’s hot! So sexy it’s mad. She is one of the hardest rappers I’ve ever heard. Her tone moves me a lot. She’s also a really sweet person, and I don’t think she’s been exposed to the opportunities that she deserves yet. I’d have her on at 1am, everyone would be lit!Esperanza Spalding is just the crème de la crème. Jazz artists like her are necessary in every festival. It’s important to have a high moment in the festival, but it’s also important to mellow down. Rihanna has got to be there, performing her smash hits to remind everyone how much of a bad bitch she is. She’s a buff ting. I’d want her to do songs from around the Good Girl Gone Bad era. Or imagine hearing Rude Boy at a festival?So, there’d have to be stuff surrounding wellness and healing, that’s needed at a festival. Maybe something like a crystal room or a room with trippy drawings. I’d make it spiritual. I would also ide the festival into different areas, with each area having a specific theme. I’d get actors to walk around and make the festival-goers believe in the theme going on around them. Like an immersive experience.This is going to sound so biased, but I love my own food. I’m a really good cook. I make lit food but don’t have a specific cuisine. It goes from lamb chops, to chicken wings, to sea bass, to octopus, to pasta. I cook anything – but it’s all tasty food! Maybe I’ll be in charge of the catering at my festival? My boy Diego also makes the best jerk chicken and banana cake in Manchester, it’s crazy. He can cook for us too.IAMDDB’s new single End of the World is released 5 August"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b19d8e31d91efcaf484d023e31e8957d9b04947c/0_90_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ab36af472711eba69ff54732c1b498c","title":"how did britain get so overweight podcast","story":"As the government launches a newly interventionist strategy to tackle obesity, the ’s Felicity Lawrence looks at whether it goes far enough to take on the might of the food industryBoris Johnson once scoffed at what he saw as the “nanny state” instincts of politicians who sought to tackle the growing waistlines of the British public.

It said that if it paid staff the pre-lockdown package of three weeks’ pay for every year of service, it could put it at risk of insolvency.A spokesperson said: “Put simply, we do not have sufficient funds to pay our current policy terms and still have funds to pay our remaining obligations.”On Wednesday, the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, told Radio 4’s Today programme it was likely to be November “at the earliest” before theatres were given a date when they could reopen without social distancing.The announcement means that for many theatres the possibility of putting on a Christmas show or pantomime, which can account for a quarter of some theatre’s annual takings, is now very unlikely.The West End producer Cameron Mackintosh said the government’s proposal to announce the date when theatres could reopen fully only in November would be “devastating” to the sector. He said he would need to open box offices in November at the latest to be able to get his theatres and productions back up and running by Easter 2021.In a column in the Evening Standard, he wrote: “If the government is unable to support this, we’re likely to have to push back our reopening to next summer, causing further devastating losses to both the theatre industry and London’s economy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9f2191029e5033edacd0e10f21cc1f48d654563/1386_1800_3526_2116/master/3526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcd005d88e378c8b805305f897f38f6b","title":"quiet as a deserted chapel test driving a hybrid car","story":" Mike Pattenden and his wife Andrea Walker take the Honda CR-V hybrid out for a spin. Here’s what they discover …Despite being the self-conscious subjects of a photoshoot in the busy car park in Bedfordshire’s Dunstable Downs, no one paid a blind bit of notice to us. Clearly, as a couple, my wife and I were as commonplace to the families, walkers and kite flyers up there on a breezy Sunday morning before lockdown as the Honda CR-V hybrid that was actually the quietly unassuming star of every shot.There were plenty of SUVs in view, even a few other Honda CR-Vs – hardly surprising, given it’s the world’s most popular SUV. More than 9m have been sold since it was launched back in 1995.When it comes to cars, “popular” is a good thing. It means dependable, safe and cheap to run and, consequently, as eye-catching as denim. And yet, this fifth-generation model of the CR-V is remarkable in its own way. It’s a hybrid with an engine that combines the best aspects of petrol combustion and electric to power it.Our CR-V is powered via a combination of a 2.0-litre Atkinson-cycle engine and two electric motors via Honda’s integrated motor assist (IMA) system, meaning it runs in three modes: EV, hybrid and petrol, constantly defaulting to electric at speeds below 30mph. In this mode, the electric motors are used to drive the wheels, using energy from the battery that was previously harvested from the petrol engine while driving at higher speeds. This means the petrol engine is generally used at lower revs, making it more fuel efficient and quieter.And, golly, is it quiet. Honda’s noise-cancelling system makes it feel like a deserted chapel as we drive around this Sunday morning, albeit one with heated pews.“You’d hear a squirrel squeak if you ran over one,” observes my wife as we drive stealthily over to Ivinghoe Beacon, where we like to walk at weekends. Luckily, no such tragedy occurs. Honda’s cross-traffic sensor warns me of a jogger as I begin to reverse (I spot him a moment later in the handy rear camera), and the CR-V hybrid has a collision detection system that prevents a rear-end shunt by slamming on the anchors for you. Having recently endured a trip to Bristol in horrendous stop-start motorway traffic, aggravated by a succession of these infuriating incidents, I’d make this feature mandatory in every car.As for efficiency, the car shifts modes seamlessly, meaning it’s incredibly thrifty, capable of 56mpg in town. You can have fun stretching its electric running, too, through regenerative braking via two paddles behind the steering wheel that slow it like changing down gears in a manual, although, given its powertrain, the CR-V hybrid is an automatic. And because of the way it tops up the batteries, there’s no recharging, so no “powernoia” on long journeys.“You don’t really have to do much, do you?” says my wife approvingly, when she takes the wheel. “I could get used to this.”On the motorway, the car switches to petrol mode at high speed and proves adept at eating up the miles in comfort. There’s a suite of driver-assist features including adaptive cruise control that will adjust distance to the car ahead, lane-keep assistance, in case you wander, and a speed limiter that will automatically maintain a specified speed – handy for the inevitable 50mph surveillance sections. For someone who views a future of driverless cars as dystopian, this level of autonomy feels perfectly acceptable to me.Inside, it’s roomy and well supplied with storage points. The centre console swallows my wife’s chunky handbag whole. There are cup holders for coffee addicts and bottle racks in the door pockets, along with charge points for phones.The boot is roomy enough for a dog. Put the rear seats down and you could probably fit a Shetland pony in. Shell out for the top-of-the-range EX model and it’s also automated, meaning you can open it by waggling your foot underneath, handy for the big shop. All but the most basic models boast a centre console with a 7in touchscreen. I had the radio set to 6 Music within a couple of minutes and the sound from the nine speakers was impressive. You can use its Garmin navigation system or set up a smartphone instead, if you wish.CR-V stands for “compact recreational vehicle”, but perhaps “considerately reinvented vehicle” is a better fit?Honda has raised the ambition of its Electric Vision strategy to ensure that all European mainstream models feature electrified powertrains by 2022, three years earlier than originally planned. On the path to this goal, they’ve released their first hybrid SUV, the CR-V, which features Intelligent Multi-Mode Drive (i-MMD) technology, enabling it to shuffle seamlessly between power sources.

First, they have to kill Lee Harvey Oswald before he can assassinate John F Kennedy and then, even more pressingly, they have to stop nuclear apocalypse. The clock is ticking. Or maybe two clocks are ticking.Typically, our bumbling heroes are doing a terrible job at saving the president and the world. Diego gets an antipsychotic sedative shot in the neck, a nightstick to the nuts and and face time with a padded cell for trying to escape to kill Oswald. Luther, whose biceps can be seen from space, is wasting his talents as a bare-knuckle prize-fighter for nightclub owner Jack Ruby, the man who, in reality, did kill, albeit too late, the president’s murderer.And Klaus who, like Marty McFly when he time travels from 1985 to 1955 in Back to the Future, gets sidetracked from his manifest destiny by sartorial minutiae. “Are hats back?” he asks, spotting two blokes accessorising trilbies with – there is no easy way to say this – short-sleeved shirts.Hold on, you might well interrupt. Apocalypse again. Really? Didn’t the Umbrella Academy avert an apocalypse in series one? Yes, it did. And now it is averting another, in series two? Don’t the writers realise there is a diminishing marginal utility rate to apocalypses as dramatic devices?Excellent questions. Let me explain what is going on. The Umbrella Academy’s superheroes are followed wherever they go by apocalypses. They arrive at some point on the space-time continuum and their first order of business is to stop the world ending. But to do so they have to battle three white-haired, leather-coated, tooled-up nihilists from The Division who are bent on ensuring Armageddon goes down as planned. The result? Lots of overlong slo-mo scenes of decorous Keanu-Reeves-circa-The-Matrix silhouettes walking down endless corridors unloading ordnance at scarpering superheroes, heedless of the mess that minimum-wage cleaners will have to sort out, not to mention the body count.The premise of this adaptation of Gerard Way and Gabriel Bá’s comic book is shaky. If the kids from the Umbrella Academy are, as we learned, followed through space-time by apocalyptic scenarios, surely the right thing to do would be for them to kill themselves for the greater good, rather than repeatedly recreate circumstances in which they have to thwart apocalypses that imperil humanity. There are economic reasons for ignoring this modest proposal. The Umbrella Academy was the third biggest hit on Netflix last year, following Stranger Things and The Witcher, so giving the punters more of the same makes business sense. But why is this risible guff so popular? Because it grafts on to the superhero format another genre – the dysfunctional family drama. It may come on like Avengers: Age of Ultron, all fatuous fisticuffs and inscrutable nonsense, plus a nice line in mock-heroic subversion of the MarvelDC franchise à la The Tick, but The Umbrella Academy’s real appeal is like that of The Royal Tennenbaums, The Sopranos or Tracy from Coronation Street.The sibling superheroes are all orphans, born to different women who gave birth on the same day they became mysteriously pregnant (because that could definitely happen) and taken up by an eccentric billionaire with a talking chimp butler who tasked them with using their superpowers to battle crime while wearing school uniforms (no one, incredibly, called social services). One can see the future, another is good with knives and yet another is super strong.But now, like Haley Joel Osment or Emma Watson, these child stars are grown and have issues. Not least Vanya (the sad-eyed Ellen Page), who wrote a book about being raised in a superhero family while having no special powers of her own.If you were raised in a troubled family (and if you say you weren’t, you definitely were), this stuff will resonate. Even more so if you were raised by a talking chimp butler and have trouble fitting into society because of your special powers and weird clothes. Which is certainly my back story and, judging from your profile, yours too.• The Umbrella Academy starts on Netflix on 31 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb6f9ec5fb4270d0217bfc7812d786980124e26e/0_430_2588_1553/master/2588.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=093c8e6778a4e9f20b601ca25ebfdb55","title":"i can see the despair on their faces lebanons economy unravels","story":"Prices of most goods have nearly tripled and the value of the national currency is plummetingby  Martin Chulov Middle East correspondent. Photography by  Achilleas ZavallisFrom her wedding dress shop in the impoverished northern Lebanese town of Akkar, Suzanne Hammoud has been selling bridal gowns for more than 15 years. She has revelled in her customers’ excitement as their weddings approached, and often stayed in touch as their lives progressed, sometimes making outfits for their children.But this year, Hammoud has become more of a buyer than a seller of dresses. Sales racks are full of gowns she has bought back from families who have no other means of income left, except for selling their memories.“I’m buying their used dresses at cost,” she said. “I can see the despair on their faces, and I don’t have the heart to say no. Even the few brides who are still coming in have hopelessness in their eyes. When they used to come to us, I saw them happy and hopeful.”On the dusty high street of one of Lebanon’s poorest corners, and across all pockets of a country conditioned to hardship over decades of war and tumult, the effects of a catastrophic economic implosion are straining its social fabric. The resilient Lebanon that somehow always made it through is fast becoming a fable, and ghosts of a recent past are stirring again.The country has defaulted on one bond payment and a second is due soon. A fire sale of state assets is being mooted as a fallback. After that, there is little left to trade, except human capital, which is leaving Lebanon en masse.All the while, the political system blamed for much of the chaos remains at a standstill and reforms demanded of Lebanese leaders by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in order to unlock aid, are being stonewalled because of the very threat they pose to a system built on patronage networks.To many who lived through the country’s civil war, it seemed things could never be as bad again. “But they are,” said Ibrahim Haddad, a commando officer in a Christian militia throughout the 15-year conflict, which was declared over in 1990. “The politicians now have learned nothing. They don’t know how to protect the country, or the martyrs. They have not earned respect.”Since 2004, Haddad has built and maintained a memorial garden for Christian fighters who died during Lebanon’s worst conflict. On a mountain top owned by the church, he has seeded the state’s emblematic cedar trees across manicured lawns, adorned with iconography and plaques commemorating each military unit. A chapel dug out of a giant rockface stands as a centrepiece.Dressed in military fatigues, the 63-year-old has devoted nearly every day of the past 16 years to tending the gardens, which appear as a statement of the status of Christians within Lebanon, as much as they are a tribute to their fallen.“This is our Arlington cemetery,” said Naji Khairallah, another veteran of the Lebanese Forces militia. “You won’t see anything like this elsewhere in Lebanon. It means a lot to us.”In his office, made of stone and iron doors wrought from a ship’s hull, Haddad added: “The Christians of Lebanon are not the Christians of Iraq, or Egypt. We know how to protect ourselves. We know how to fight.”Nearby, the two military leaders of the militia turned political bloc, which now holds a whip hand in Lebanese affairs, were buried under cutouts of their likenesses. Casualties from more distant battles with Israel were scattered around the still, silent room. Outside, the hustle of the new economic reality was being conducted in hushed phone calls in which the latest dollar rate was disclosed like a bookmaking racket. “It’s 9,200 to the dollar now,” said one exchange shop owner, of the dollar rate, which was pegged at 1,500 Lebanese lira before the crisis. “It will be lower tomorrow.”As controls on Lebanon’s financial system continue to weaken, the black market is eclipsing the formal economy. The government has been powerless, or unwilling, to stop the fall of the lira, and stymie a huge outflow of capital. Prices of food and clothes – almost all imported – are increasing daily, a trend amplified by the transfer of dollars to Syria to try to stabilise a similarly plunging currency.Up to $21bn (£16bn) has been drained from the country in the past year, financial experts say, by a political and commercial elite who oppose reforms that would replace patronage networks as pillars of political and economic life with merit-based appointments, a reined-in banking system, and a robust private sector.Alain Bifani, the director general of Lebanon’s finance ministry for 20 years until he quit in June in protest at flatlining negotiations with the IMF over terms of an international bailout, said: “We were very close to having those who benefit so much from the system having to contribute. And this would have undermined the system of power and privilege they had put in place and allowed a modern state to emerge.“But they got scared and they weren’t strong enough to take this step. They would not touch the happy few. Those who had benefited most wanted to throw the losses on the 5 million Lebanese, by taking over public infrastructure.“If you want to rebuild a state, you have to rebuild its assets. How do you do that if you dispose of everything?”In West Beirut’s Hamra Street, director of al-Madina theatre, Nidal Al Achkar, is sitting in a room surrounded by framed photos of actors. Power cuts have cast an eerie darkness over the normally bustling boulevard outside. The arc of chaos from the end of the civil war, to the beginning of what many see as an even greater existential crisis, troubles her. She has just reopened for business after closing down for six months.“When the war finished, they didn’t sit around a table and ask themselves questions,” she said. “So, all these people started ruling the country again, and nobody stopped them. And this time they started stealing.“Money, power and religion, they have worked together for hundreds of years. If one falls, the other will pick them up. It’s a world built on sectarianism and family traditions, not ideas that look to the future, but those that tie them to the past.“This city of Beirut has no hope any more. There is no trust. They have nothing to dream about. What are we going to dream, what are we going to eat, when is the electricity going to come, how much is a kilo of tomatoes?”How Lebanon got to this point seems less important to many than where it is inexorably heading. Throughout 77 years of nominal independence, the country’s regional political alliances have been even more central to its fate than its internal rivalries. That dynamic has become increasingly potent, with Lebanese officials having lost credibility among key backers, who would had delivered bailout dollars during earlier crises, but are in no mood to do so now.The 2016 election by MPs of the Maronite Christian and Iran ally Michel Aoun as president, allowing the Iran-backed Hezbollah to join the government – making the group the country’s strongest political presence – soured ties with Saudi Arabia, particularly with the then Lebanese prime minister, Saad Hariri.“The causes have added up,” said Michel Moawad, a prominent MP. “It was a big geopolitical position for the country to take to isolate itself and become part of the Iranian axis, while the economy is dollarised and our partners are the Arab world and the west. We lost our main investors and economic partners. The business model of the country was broken.”When anti-government demonstrations erupted last October, communal and confessional differences that had been often seen as faultlines in Lebanon were subsumed by a soaring patriotism.Suha Barakat, 26, a protester in central Beirut for the six weeks of demonstrations, said it was the most important time of her life. “I believed,” she said. “And I still want to believe. But I came back to Lebanon from Dubai for this, and now I’m stuck. I hope we’re not just tribal after all.”Last Saturday, at his palace in the Chouf mountains, Walid Jumblatt, the Druze leader and a civil war figure who remains a lynchpin of the ruling elite, was addressing Druze sheikhs about the crises facing the community and country.Jumblatt paused, then responded: “We’re at the end of world war one, a time of looming famine and dreadful Spanish flu. We were buying grain from Syria, and locusts were plaguing the land.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/846237f9bcb7099921d7a69bc1c68482c45cec33/0_150_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05321618090a1090534b17c382c39020","title":"justin trudeau charity family parliament committee","story":"Justin Trudeau has told parliament he did not intervene to make sure a charity his family did paid work for would win a government contract.The Canadian prime minister has previously apologized and in an appearance before a parliamentary committee on Thursday, he said again that he should have recused himself from a cabinet decision to award a contract to administer money to students having trouble finding work due to the pandemic.The almost billion-dollar program came under scrutiny after it was revealed that We Charity, an organization Trudeau’s family has worked for, was chosen to administer it. Trudeau’s wife, brother and mother have been paid a combined C$300,000 (US$221,000) for speaking at a number of WE events.“We Charity received no preferential treatment, not from me, not from anyone else,” said Trudeau, who noted it was the government public service that recommended the government award the contract to We Charity. “I did absolutely nothing to influence that recommendation.”Trudeau said when he learned that We Charity was recommended he “pushed back”.“When the issue of We came forward my concern was to push back on it, to delay it from cabinet so that more due diligence could happen. Looking back on it, it would have been better for perception’s sake that I had simply stepped away and not been involved at all,” Trudeau said. “None of this program was going to benefit any members of my family.”Canada’s ethics commissioner is investigating Trudeau over the matter. It is the third ethics investigation Trudeau has faced.Under pressure, the government and the charity terminated their deal on 3 July. Students could volunteer up to 500 hours of work with community organizations to earn the maximum C$5,000 (US$3,668) toward their postsecondary education costs.Canada’s federal ethics commissioner said Trudeau violated conflict of interest rules in 2016 when he vacationed over Christmas at the private Bahamian island owned by the Aga Khan.

Therefore, this change of advice from the CMOs, aimed to reduce coronavirus transmission, is particularly timely and welcome.”He warned, though, that families would need extra help if they would set to lose income or have difficulties shopping for food and essentials for longer.Dr Julian Tang, honorary associate professor in respiratory sciences at the University of Leicester, said: “The evidence for this 10-day rather than seven-day cut-off has been around for some months already – and more and more studies confirm this.“There have been concerns about the former seven-day isolation cut-off for sometime now – because it just didn’t tally with the evidence. Finally, now it does.”Prof Peter Openshaw from Imperial College London and the British Society for Immunology welcomed the extension to 10 days, “given some hints of resurgence”.It is clear people are most infectious just before and a couple of days after they show symptoms, he said, but recent work has shown they may have infectious virus up to nine days after the onset.“We are now in a critical stage of controlling the disease. Keeping infection rates low is vital and extending the period of isolation to 10 days brings us in line with some other European countries. It seems to be a sensible precaution to keep pressure on the virus while other measures to control the spread of Sars-CoV-2 are developed,” he said.In a statement, the four chief medical officers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, said: “In symptomatic people Covid-19 is most infectious just before, and for the first few days after symptoms begin. It is very important people with symptoms self-isolate and get a test, which will allow contact tracing.“Evidence, although still limited, has strengthened and shows that people with Covid-19 who are mildly ill and are recovering have a low but real possibility of infectiousness between seven and nine days after illness onset.“We have considered how best to target interventions to reduce risk to the general population and consider that at this point in the epidemic, with widespread and rapid testing available and considering the relaxation of other measures, it is now the correct balance of risk to extend the self-isolation period from seven to 10 days for those in the community who have symptoms or a positive test result.“This will help provide additional protection to others in the community. This is particularly important to protect those who have been shielding and in advance of the autumn and winter when we may see increased community transmission.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1b2409f29ce1b9eb7cd4c3030ba7c93d0644dfd/63_172_3548_2128/master/3548.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ff271fd8504f797e07192801f52d4f9","title":"arderns labour party has the numbers to govern alone latest poll suggests","story":"Jacinda Ardern’s Labour party is on track to govern alone after New Zealand’s election in September, a second public poll in a week has suggested.However, the result is the same an endorsement of Ardern’s leadership and the opportunity for Labour to run a majority government for the first time since New Zealand’s electoral system switch in 1996.Ardern said: “It is pleasing to see that there’s ongoing support from New Zealanders for the government’s response to Covid-19 and our recovery.”While Labour has shone in the poll, the same cannot be said for their government partners, New Zealand First and the Greens.Collins, a conservative veteran, took the top job after Todd Muller’s surprise resignation earlier this month.

It’s a controversial subject but that didn’t stop scores of you weighing in, suggesting everything from fiscal tweaks and the repudiation of growth to an outright no-child policy.A random selection appears below, but before we get to them, a quick roundup of the week in Upside news.• The return of the great European sleeper train.

One-minute read• The startling collapse of plastic bag usage. One-minute read writers have latched on to the population issue (Sian Cain on the child-free debate is particularly good). But Upside readers have been more prolific still. Here’s a flavour of what you said when asked about the impact of a levelling off of global population.Sju Thorup in Gentofte, Denmark, wants to be far from the madding crowdNobody benefits from a world of 8 billion or 11 billion people, except for large capital interests that need cheap labour and mindless consumers. Children in smaller families receive more of their parents’ time, efforts, money, living space. Parents in smaller families enjoy more time to themselves and better opportunities for each child.No inidual person enjoys being surrounded by other people at all times, competing for space and resources. Personally, I think that ideally the Earth could carry about 1 billion people who could all enjoy sufficient space, sufficient contact with nature, sufficient work and sufficient leisure, sufficient food and clean water. Such number of humans would enable us to leave enough room for ecosystems to recover and to remain fertile and robust, and to provide “ecosystem services” for a content humanity. But I know I am dreaming, for now. Such a scenario would require our decision-makers to think long-term and holistically, to decide restrictions on our activities, and enforce those restrictions all around. Too few people in power feel this need yet.Stella Dixon in Chester, England, says the debate should be about consumption, not absolute numbers of peopleI don’t understand what is so terrifying about the population reaching 11 billion people. There is nothing inherently threatening about more people existing, it is the conditions of their existence that count. I think it is more useful to focus on preventing the terror of human suffering, not caused by population but other factors. The world’s population is immense and almost impossible to change, while these other factors are much more actionable without signalling to eugenics.If the concern is overconsumption causing climate change, then people with the means to do so can make a difference by reducing the impact of their consumption – buying less, buying locally, and buying items sustainable both in environmental and human rights terms.Duncan Orr in Edinburgh worries about what population decline would mean for 200 years of steadily growing prosperityThe problems of a decreasing population are much more extreme than most people realise. While everyone talks about the cost of caring for an ageing population, the economic effects go far beyond that… growth becomes not simply more difficult but impossible at the global level. For years the environmental movement has talked about the need for a zero-growth world and logically they are right: infinite growth is not possible on a finite planet. But all of the economics and ideologies of the last two centuries… have been built on the idea that economic growth is what leads to the prosperity and wellbeing of a country.Policymakers around the globe are going to have to come to terms with the fact that a zero-growth world is being thrust upon them, and a whole new way of operating is going to have to be devised if we are to maintain living standards into the next century.Clint Koble in the US said fiscal policy should encourage people to have fewer childrenFewer people on the planet would put less stress on wildlife and the environment. It would stop the growth of large urban areas and hopefully, stop the burning of the Amazon forest. Fewer people would ensure that in the future, people would have a job. We wouldn’t have to fear automization, robotics etc.Instead of offering tax deductions for additional family members, we should penalize additional family members above 2 children as a possible way to control the population.

So it’d be great if it would fall, but what this estimate presents would be far too little, far too late. The only way to offer everyone a decent standard of living and a large amount of freedom in all other aspects of life, … and also, eventually, have a healthy ecosystem, is to not only fully embrace and encourage far fewer births but, considering how bad things are, even find ways to completely stop births for a time.Nils Wetterlind sent a postcard from the future – a rapidly depopulating province in JapanThe sober view of all this is of course that Japan’s population more than doubled in the last 100 years, so it shouldn’t be a disaster if it shrank back to 50-60 million living souls. That is still a huge amount of people compared to my own homeland, Sweden, which is more or less exactly the same size as Japan, and of a very similar shape, but only has 10 million inhabitants.And of course it would have a gigantic positive impact on the planet if these islands had half, or a quarter, of the people they have today.There are only benefits to having a smaller, more technologically reliant society.

People “not abiding to social distancing” has led to a surge of coronavirus cases, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said. The measure applies in Greater Manchester, Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle, Rossendale, Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees and the city of Leicester. The government announced the full local lockdown in Leicester would be partially lifted, allowing restaurants, bars, cinemas, museums and hairdressers to reopen from Monday and for religious ceremonies to take place. Leisure centres, gyms and pools will remain closed in the city.A slew of England’s biggest businesses are set to defy the government’s push to get workers back into offices in August, a  analysis shows, with many sticking to home working arrangements or delaying a partial return until September at the earliest. Here we take a sector-by-sector look at some major employers and their working plans. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) said it would be “heartless and reckless” for bosses to demand the immediate return of shielding workers on 1 August, when the government will no longer pay them statutory sick pay. The TUC is asking employers to instead continue using the government’s job retention scheme for shielding workers, which runs until October.Labour is to launch a “Jobs, Jobs, Jobs” campaign today over mass job losses caused by coronavirus, saying the gradual removal of the employment furlough scheme from the start of August is a “historic mistake”. Keir Starmer will argue the furlough scheme should continue to support the worst-hit industries.

Infamously, this includes Gucci’s blackface jumper, Prada’s golliwog trinket and Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana’s pizza advert. And yet there is a reluctance to discuss the underlying issues openly.Speaking to  in June, Buchanan said there was “extreme fatigue” around the admission of racism in the country. “But that doesn’t justify the constant denial,” he said.The incidents continue to occur. Earlier this week, label Marni was criticised online for the demeaning and colonialistic imagery used for their SS20 collection. Instagram account and self-appointed industry watchdog Diet Prada reported that the images featured a black model with chains lying suggestively close to his feet, and another which featured the phrase “jungle mood” juxtaposed next to a black model. The visual allusions had some commenting: “This is the worst example presenting black bodies through the white gaze.” Marni later deleted the images and apologised saying: “As we endeavor to create a more equitable world … we sincerely regret that our efforts cause further pain.”The letter from Jean and Buchanan suggests there would be less moments of gross cultural insensitivity if there were black people in senior decision-making roles. “Many of the mishaps and racially insensitive conversations that have happened in Italy are clearly due to companies not including black people internally from entry-level to executive positions,” it says. “The oversights are clear every time a major gaffe is made.”Jean said racism in Italian fashion continues to be the elephant in the room. “(I am) well aware that racism is one of the most uncomfortable topics in Italy,” she said. “But trust me, the topic is not less uncomfortable than being the first and only black-owned brand in the history of a white-only fashion council (the current ratio is 1 out of 113) . We can all agree that the only way to dismantle the issue is to acknowledge it.” She added she hoped some changes would be in effect by the next Milan fashion week, which begins on 22 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/118eebefa76291893fc338aca184350b76cb7bec/0_0_4893_2937/master/4893.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8c48a609c8f984e984c088e16ed20e2","title":"scaled down hajj begins in coronavirus era in pictures","story":"Attendance limited to 10,000 people already residing in Saudi Arabia, rather than the usual 2 million including from abroad, amid Covid-19 restrictions"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0918023002a1d9e15b7aa1c96f7a3d8bcb504d54/0_361_5417_3250/master/5417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abb0adf8fead8b047ef7730e21286d8e","title":"coronavirus live news england tightens restrictions who says young people behind some spikes","story":"Vietnam reports biggest jump in cases Brazil’s Bolsonaro treated for infection WHO says ‘young people’ behind some spikesSpain must focus on recovery after after registering an “unprecedented” collapse in second-quarter GDP, prime minister Pedro Sanchez said on Friday ahead of a meeting with regional leaders, Reuters reports.Reducing inequality between Spain’s regions must be a part of any eventual recovery, he said, adding that the worst moments of the crisis had now passed.The Philippine health ministry on Friday confirmed 4,063 novel coronavirus infections, reporting the highest daily case increase in south-east Asia for a second straight day, Reuters reports.In a bulletin, the ministry said the total number of confirmed infections have risen to 93,354, while deaths increased by 40 to 2,023.Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte on Friday maintained coronavirus restrictions in the capital and some provinces for a further two weeks to try to control the spread of the virus.Meanwhile, Indonesia reported2,040 new coronavirus infections on Friday and 73 additional deaths, according to data published on the country’s Covid-19 taskforce website.This brought Indonesia’s total number of confirmed infections to 108,376 and deaths to 5,131.Poland reported its highest number of new daily coronavirus cases since the global pandemic started for the second day in a row on Friday, with 657 new cases, Reuters reports, citing the health ministry.The ministry reported seven new deaths, with a total of 45,688 reported coronavirus cases and 1,716 deaths.Of the new cases, 227 were in the Silesia region, which has been grappling with an outbreak amongst miners.

Those that comply will be eligible for a subsidy of ¥200,000 ($1,900).“As we look to the long fight against the coronavirus, asking for complete business shutdowns is not realistic,” Koike said, according to the Nikkei business paper. The central and local governments do not have the legal power to enforce business closures or limit their opening hours, and have relied on bars, restaurants, clubs and other establishments to take action voluntarily.Friday’s record number of new infections comes a day after Tokyo announced 367 new cases – another record. Infections have been rising in several parts of Japan since a nationwide state of emergency was lifted at the end of May, with a large number of cases traced to the city’s nightlife districts.The number of infections in Tokyo now exceeds 12,000, more than half of which were reported this month. Japan’s total rose to 35,461 on Thursday, including 700 people from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined in Yokohama in February. The country’s death toll stands at 1,020.Here’s a summary of the latest coronavirus developments:In the US, Donald Trump has said closing schools across the country was causing death. “Keeping them out of school and keeping work closed is causing death also,” he said. “Economic harm, but it’s causing death for different reasons, but death. Probably more death.”After 150,000 coronavirus deaths in the country, Trump added the country “understands what it is dealing with now”, before pointing out leaders in countries like Australia and Japan were praised before a resurgence in Covid-19 cases.

Biarritz will also ban access to its beaches at night to prevent parties being held there.The mayor of Saint-Malo, whose walled city has drawn tens of thousands of French tourists who opted to stay in the country for the summer holidays, said masks were now mandatory inside the old city and on the ramparts for everyone aged 11 and over. The UK’s health secretary, Matt Hancock, said “households gathering and not abiding by the social-distancing rules” was a reason for the stricter rules, announced late on Thursday evening, and that the move was in order to “keep the country safe”.He said: “We take this action with a heavy heart but unfortunately it’s necessary because we’ve seen that households meeting up and a lack of social distancing is one of the causes of this rising rate of coronavirus and we’ll do whatever is necessary to keep the country safe.”Press Association writes that the move comes as celebrations take place for the Muslim festival of Eid al Adha, which started on Thursday evening and continues over the weekend, and after the government reimposed quarantine measures for those arriving in the UK from Spain and Luxembourg.The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, welcomed the measures, which he said would be reviewed on a weekly basis.But the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, criticised the handling of the changes. He tweeted:“No one would argue with putting in place local action to reduce the transmission of coronavirus.”“But announcing measures affecting potentially millions of people late at night on Twitter is a new low for the government’s communications during this crisis,” he said.The household mixing restrictions will also apply in Leicester, which has seen the first so-called local lockdown since June, but other measures in the city will be eased. From Monday restaurants, cafes, bars and hairdressers can reopen - but leisure centres, gyms and pools will remain closed.On Saturday, Luton will be brought in line with the rest of the country after “significant progress”.

Photograph:iStockModifying 12 risk factors over the course of one’s life could delay or prevent 40 per cent of dementia cases, according to the latest verdict of The Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention and care.The commission has added three new “key modifiable risks factors” that make people more vulnerable to dementia excessive alcohol consumption in mid-life, suffering head injuries in mid-life and exposure to air pollution in later life. Led by 28 world-leading dementia experts, the report builds on the nine risk factors from childhood to later life identified in 2017, and provides an up-to-date analysis of the best evidence on the prevention of dementia. “The potential to prevent cases of dementia is high,” it adds.Its latest report presented at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference on Thursday calls of states and iniduals to be ambitious about preventing dementia and lays out a set of policies and lifestyle changes to help prevent dementia. Worldwide around 50 million people live with dementia, a figure projected to increase to 152 million by 2050, rising particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) where around two-thirds of people with dementia live. Dementia affects iniduals, their families, and the economy - with global costs estimated at about €1 trillion annually.Combined, the three new risk factors are associated with 6 per cent of all dementia cases – with an estimated 3 per cent of cases attributable to head injuries in mid-life 1 per cent of cases to excessive alcohol consumption (more than 21 units per week) in mid-life, and 2 per cent to exposure to air pollution in later life. The remaining risk factors are associated with 34 per cent of all dementia cases. The factors associated with the greatest proportion of dementia cases in the population are less education in early life hearing loss in mid-life, and smoking in later life (7 per cent, 8 per cent, and 5 per cent, respectively).In certain countries, however, the proportion of older people with dementia has fallen, probably due to improvements in education, nutrition, healthcare, and lifestyle changes – demonstrating the possibility of reducing dementia through preventative measures, it concludes.“Our report shows it is within the power of policy-makers and iniduals to prevent and delay a significant proportion of dementia, with opportunities to make an impact at each stage of a person’s life,” says lead author Prof Gill Livingston of University College London, UK. “Interventions are likely to have the biggest impact on those who are disproportionately affected by dementia risk factors, like those in low- and middle-income countries and vulnerable populations, including Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic communities,” he added. Prof Livingston added: “As societies, we need to think beyond promoting good health to prevent dementia, and begin tackling inequalities to improve the circumstances in which people live their lives.” Risks could be reduced by creating active and healthy environments for communities, “where physical activity is the norm, better diet is accessible for all, and exposure to excessive alcohol is minimised”. The authors call for nine ambitious actions to be undertaken by policymakers and iniduals: – Aim to maintain systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury) or less in midlife from around age 40 years– Encourage use of hearing aids for hearing loss reduce hearing loss by protecting ears from high noise levels– Reduce exposure to air pollution and second-hand tobacco smoke– Prevent head injury (particularly by targeting high-risk occupations and transport)– Prevent alcohol misuse and limit drinking to less than 21 units per week– Stop smoking uptake and support iniduals to stop smoking (which the authors stress is beneficial at any age)– Provide all children with primary and secondary education– Lead an active life into mid, and possibly later life – Reduce obesity and diabetes. These actions, they say, are especially important in LMICs such as China, India and Latin America, where dementia rates are rising more rapidly than in high-income countries. This is due to increasing life expectancy, and a higher frequency of dementia risk factors such as lower rates of education high rates of hypertension, obesity, hearing loss and rapidly growing rates of diabetes. The authors note they were careful to only include risk factors with strong evidence for a causal link. Their report calls for holistic and inidualised evidence-based care that addresses physical and mental health, social care, and support that can accommodate complex needs of those with dementia. “Keeping people with dementia physically healthy is important for their cognition but they often have other illnesses which they may struggle to manage on their own, resulting in potentially harmful preventable hospitalisations,” it notes.

Photograph Nick BradshawThe Nineteenth century documentation proves conclusively that the statues taken down by the Shelbourne Hotel do not depict slave girls, an art historian has said.Kyle Leyden, who is a lecturer in the history of art and architecture at the University of London, says the original catalogue from which the four statues were ordered clearly label them not as slaves, but Egyptian and African women.Hotel management said on Tuesday they took the decision to remove the pieces, which have been in place for 153 years, in light of world events and the Black Lives Matter movement calling attention to the legacy of slavery around the world.In a statement on Wednesday Dublin City Council said it was “not aware of permission being granted to remove the statues concerned. “The matter is under investigation by the planning enforcement section and therefore no further comment can be made on the matter at this time.”The catalogue of the Val d’Orsne foundary in Paris, where the statues were cast, has been digitised and is available online.The statues were originally designed and sculpted by Mathirin Moreau (1822-1912) son of another famous French sculptor, Jean-Baptiste-Louis-Joseph Moreau.In 1849 he entered into an association with the Val d’Orsne foundry and became one of its directors.Under the arrangement, he supplied models to be cast and mass produced by the foundry which could thus sell them on to architects under his name (as appears in the catalogue) on the basis of his fame as a sculptor. They were sold to those who could not afford an original work.Mr Leyden said the architect of the Shelbourne Hotel who designed the current facade, John McCurdy, would have ordered the four statues from the catalogue which was published in the late 1850s.It was clear the from the catalogue that McCurdy ordered two “Égyptienne” female statues to stand astride the front doors of the hotels with the other two statues entitled “Négresse” at either end of the front facade.The word “Négresse”, as used by the French in the mid-19th century, meant the female figure was of African origin, but not from North Africa.Mr Leyden explained that, if the statues were intended to depict Nubian slaves, they would have been classified as such because they were in vogue in the mid-1860s when the four statues were commissioned for the Shelbourne Hotel.However, Nubian slave statues were usually male nudes and were depicted in poses of servitude. The Shelbourne Hotel statues are of well-dressed females in an enlightened pose, he stressed.“’Nubian slave’ was a well-known and much fetishised nineteenth-century visual trope and to some buyers of statues would no doubt have been an attractive and very fashionable visual reference which was distinctly au courrant,” he said.“Verdi was writing Aida about a Nubian slave at precisely the time the Shelbourne was being built. If Moreau, the Val d’Orsne company or McCurdy had wanted a statue of a Nubbin slave, they would have had no qualms about calling it precisely that.”Mr Leyden said the blame for categorising the statues as slave girls may lie with the novelist Elizabeth Bowen who described them as “Nubian in aspect holding a torch-shaped lamp. Two of the four are princesses two are slave-girls. I like to image that Mr McCurdy and Mrs Jury (wife of one of the co-owners) chose the statues together”. That description was published in her 1951 book on the Shelbourne Hotel.“As anyone who has read it can attest, it was never intended to be an academic history of the hotel but rather a novelesque evocation of the place and its people,” Mr Leyden explained.“ It is not based on what we would today deem to be sound academic research. Her reference to the statues is as baseless and romanticised as her imagined scene of Mrs Jury personally choosing the statues because of their clothed respectability.“Yet this reference has been repeated ad nauseam ever since. There is no source for the slave assertion save Bowen’s own romantic imagination coloured by her knowledge of nineteenth-century Orientalist literary tropes.“Indeed, several other statues in the catalogue (mainly male) are specifically labelled as Nubian, but not the two chosen at the Shelbourne. They are not slaves. They are not shackled. All four wear golden anklets as symbols of their aristocratic rank. They are all aristocratic women of Egypt and Africa.“Thus it seems likely McCurdy chose these statues firstly because their proportion suited his building. Secondly, their symbolic message was one of luxury, hinting at the deliciously licentious opulence of the new hotel. Choosing statues from the best art foundry in the world would also have had much currency in promoting the opulence of the hotel.” Mr Leyden said the Shelbourne Hotel had made a wrong decision in getting rid of the statues from their plinths and had clearly misrepresented the statues as the depiction of slaves.He suggested the issue could have been easily resolved by placing leaflets at the front door describing the provenance of the statues.“ In this the statues could become commercial incentives to visits rather than an embarrassment and, should any problems arise, the leaflet will easily explain why they are there,” he added.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 cases in several green list states rise at higher rate than in ireland","story":"Some countries on the Government’s travel green list have seen significant increases in Covid-19 cases since the list was announced last week.The latest figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) confirm the extent of sharp rises in infection rates in Gibraltar, Monaco and Malta since July 21st, based on the number of new cases per 100,000 inhabitants over the previous 14 days.As of Wednesday, cases in Malta have increased to 6.9 new cases per 100,000 people, compared with the State, which is currently at 5.3.Monaco has seen an 800 per cent increase to 27 such cases per 100,000 people, while Gibraltar’s figure has increased from 2.9 to 17.8.Other countries on the green list, announced late on July 21st, which have seen an increase include Cyprus from 3.9 to 5.1, Italy from 4.6 to 5.2, Lithuania from 3.8 to 5.4 and Slovakia from 3.9 to 5.4.People arriving into the State from countries on the green list do not need to spend 14 days in self-isolation or to restrict their movements.Countries on the list which have seen an increase in cases but whose new cases per 100,000 people are still less than three include\u0026nbspFinland, Greenland, Hungary and Norway.Estonia, Greece, Latvia and San Marino, which are also on the green list, have seen new cases per 100,000 people decrease since July 21st.It was confirmed on Wednesday that the Government is unlikely to undertake an immediate review of the countries on its green list despite some states experiencing big increases in cases.The Government is to stick to a fortnightly review of countries considered safe to travel to.Health adviceThe list was drawn up at a Cabinet meeting on July 21st based on advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and it will be August 4th at the earliest before the list will be re-examined.A Government spokesperson said the locations on the green list have a “similar or lower incidence of the virus to Ireland”.“A number of factors are taken into account – such as the number of new cases over the past 14 days per 100,000 of inhabitants, overall response to Covid-19 etc.“Data from the European centre of disease control which benchmarks countries based on the number of positive tests per 100,000 in the last 14 days is being used,” the spokesperson said.Meanwhile, the latest data shows that the number of new cases in Spain stands at 51.1 per 100,000 people, while Portugal is at 32.7, France is at 17.1, and the UK is at 14. The US’s figure for new cases per 100,000 inhabitants currently stands at 279.7."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4318184.1596153027!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"d%C3%A1il suspended twice after tds roar at each other over speaking rights","story":"The Dáil was suspended twice in the final hours before the summer recess as TDs argued furiously over speaking slots for Dáil debates. Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett was accused of ‘histrionics’ when he again refused to sit down. Image: Oireachtas TVThe final hours of the Dáil sitting before the summer recess ended in vitriolic exchanges with the House being suspended twice in a tumultuous row over speaking slots for Dáil debates.Small political parties and Independent groups expressed fury at a deal they claimed would allow the Government to remove them from the early stages of debates and effectively “muzzle” them.The Government sought the changes to give their backbench TDs better speaking slots.In chaotic scenes, Government and Opposition TDs roared at each other across the Dáil auditorium in the Dublin Convention Centre.Leas Cheann Comhairle Catherine Connolly struggled to maintain order and was forced to suspend proceedings for 10 minutes when TDs refused to take their seats.And Tánaiste Leo Varadkar hit out at the “arrogance, nastiness and abusiveness of the smaller parties and far left parties” who tried to dominate the chamber.In a major broadside he said he was “embarrassed to be a member of this chamber tonight frankly because of the behaviour of some of the parties”.He said the new procedures would still give Opposition parties 74 per cent of the speaking time, “even though they’ve less than half the seats”.Mr Varadkar claimed that any time a Government Minister or backbencher tries to make a point “you shout us down in the same way you bully people online”.He said they repeatedly tried to “bully people in here because they are from a larger party”.The row erupted when People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett and Rise TD Paul Murphy refused to resume their seats.Mr Murphy claimed the Government was attempting to marginalise left-wing parties and groups.Ms Connolly described TDs’ behaviour as “disgraceful” before suspending the House.Ceann Comhairle Sean Ó Fearghaíl later was forced to suspend the House a second time and accused Mr Boyd Barrett of “histrionics” when he again refused to sit down.Earlier, Social Democrats TD Catherine Murphy said the Dáil would restart in September with “an outrageous proposal to change the rota of speakers in a way that had not been changed since the 1920s”.Fine Gael TD Brendan Griffin told Opposition deputies they were a “national disgrace and we’re entitled to our speaking time and we won’t be denied our right to speak”.People Before Profit TD Bríd Smith said it was like a “dictatorship” of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.Sinn Féin TD Pádraig Mac Lochlainn said what had happened was deeply regrettable and his party had put forward a compromise proposal to strike a balance for all but the proposal was rejected.When a vote was taken in the Dáil the Government proposal was accepted by 86 to 63 votes.The uproar followed a row earlier in the day on the issue when it was first raised.Under the new proposal, the Government parties, Sinn Féin and Labour will speak in the first slots.Then Government and Sinn Féin will speak again followed by the next largest party (Social Democrats) and so on.It means the Coalition and main Opposition parties will get to speak before each smaller party or grouping gets a chance to be heard.While the amount of speaking time does not change, speakers from the smaller parties will not be heard until much later in the proceedings, when usually there is less interest in the debate.Mr Varadkar said it “wasn’t fair” that in the previous Dáil “Independent TDs and people from micro parties got more speaking time than Government backbenchers”.Social Democrats TD Jennifer Whitmore said “it beggars belief” that the Government and Sinn Féin have come together “to exclude voices of the Social Democrats, Solidarity-People Before Profit and Independent groupings from the speaking times”.But Mr Varadkar insisted “we are going to re-establish democracy in this House” and the Opposition “can try to shout us down as much as they like”.The row in the chamber on Thursday followed a stormy meeting on Wednesday of the Dáil Reform Committee where the Government parties and Sinn Féin agreed to change the current arrangement where a representative from each party and grouping gets to speak in rotation at the start of debates.Ms Whitmore said “it is undemocratic and unfair. It is very disappointing that Sinn Féin has joined the Government on this front.”Rise TD Paul Murphy claimed “the Government is trying to muzzle the Opposition” and it was not about the amount of speaking time.But Mr Varadkar said every TD’s mandate “is equal” and “we had a situation in the previous Dáil where Government backbenchers could not get speaking time”.He said “Independent deputies and people from micro parties got more speaking time than Government backbenchers did and that wasn’t fair.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4318512.1596178075!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"green party removes speaking rights from two tds for not voting with government","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen TD Neasa Hourigan  voted against the Government.

File photograph: Oireachtas TV screenshotEach of the three Government parties has had an eventful time since the election on February 8th, and arguably none more than the Greens.In the wake of the election two ideological camps emerged in the party and they conducted an intensive – and at times bitter – debate about going into Government with the two parties that epitomise the establishment.It played out in the vote on Government, in allegations of bullying on social media, and in a leadership contest that was decided by a hair’s breadth. In the way these things are given shorthand, party leader Eamon Ryan and deputy leader Catherine Martin came to personify both sides. And then there was a breakaway, with the formation of a new ginger group called Just Transition that is kind of semi-detached from the party.There were hopes that after all that things would settle down for a while and the Government could go about its business.Going overboardHowever, the tranquillity was strictly temporary and was shattered by two of the 12 Green Party TDs going overboard on Thursday on a Bill designed to extend the protections for tenants who have lost their jobs or income during the Covid-19 pandemic.But there was a sting in the tail. One of the Dublin Central TD’s colleagues, Joe O’Brien, abstained in the vote on the substantive Bill.Although he did not vote against it, O’Brien’s decision was seen as the more serious. He is Minister of State for Community Development and Charities and a member of the Government.This was not a private member’s Bill, but a Government Bill, and while not a member of Cabinet, there would be an expectation that O’Brien would have signed up to collective Cabinet responsibility. There was an issue in the last Dáil with Independent Alliance ministers abstaining on Bills, but such abstentions were on private member’s Bills, not on legislation being sponsored by the Government.A Minister from one of the other parties said that this was a relatively benign Bill in the context of some of the really difficult decisions that will have to be taken in the autumn. The Minister said it did not give much confidence on the longevity of the Government, if its TDs were peeling off at such an early stage.Disciplinary processSo what happens now? Nobody in the Greens was in a position to say if the party has a formal disciplinary process, or sanction regime. In New Zealand, members of the Green Party there have an agreement in relation to voting against the government on non-programme issues. But no such arrangement exists here. There is an expectation that TDs support the Government in votes on every occasion.Green Party people were at sixes and sevens on Thursday night. There was no official response from the party. Some were not aware of what was going to happen. The party has a “conscience clause” that allows representatives to abstain, but there was uncertainty about whether it applied in this case. Besides, such concerns have to be flagged with the party’s executive council. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael said the matter is up to the Greens. There will probably be a meeting of the three governing party leaders to discuss the issue and what to do.“What’s going to happen when the really hard stuff arrives, the stuff none of us want to vote for?” said a Fine Gael TD. “If this is what it’s like so early, how can the Government survive its full term?”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4316073.1595964623!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"post brexit checks may deter firms like tesco from trading in northern ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConcerns that big British businesses such as Tesco will be deterred from trading in Northern Ireland after Brexit have been raised in the House of Lords. Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGettyConcerns that big British businesses such as Tesco will be deterred from trading in Northern Ireland after Brexit have been raised in the House of Lords.Lord Kerr, the architect of article 50 which enabled the UK to exit the EU, has warned that the special arrangements put in place to avoid a border on the island of Ireland may be a fatal trade barrier for some companies.Under the Northern Ireland protocol, all businesses sending goods to the region from Great Britain will have to make formal declarations for the first time, with food sellers such as supermarkets subject to separate checks on chilled and fresh food from January.“How confident are you that GB businesses are just not going to write off the Northern Ireland market?” he asked the Northern Ireland minister Robin Walker who was appearing before the Lords EU committee.Just three weeks ago the first details of the new trading conditions across the Irish Sea emerged, with businesses obliged to complete three rounds of customs, security and transit forms on all goods being transported to Northern Ireland.Mr Walker said the government intended the new system to be “light touch” and streamlined.However, he faced further questions about the government’s preparedness with Lord Teverson questioning whether the new IT system, the Goods Vehicle Movement System, would be tested in time.And the former Conservative chancellor Lord Lamont challenged Boris Johnson’s repeated assertion that Northern Ireland businesses would continue to enjoy “unfettered access” to Great British markets.Lord Lamont argued there was a clear conflict in the Brexit protocol between article 5, which demands Northern Ireland businesses complete exit summary declarations for all goods being transported to the rest of the UK, and article 6, which promises “unfettered access”.“That is a rather awkward thing,” he told Mr Walker as he defended the government position, saying it was within the UK’s gift to ensure unfettered access.Mr Walker conceded that some of the detail of the protocol had yet to be agreed by the joint committee chaired by Michael Gove and the vice-president of the European Commission, Maroš Šefcovic.He also said details on the Northern Ireland border operating model, expected yesterday, would be published in the “coming weeks”. - "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4317119.1596058117!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"second shock of brexit may be too much for ireland to cope with coveney told","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney  has been warned that Ireland is ‘facing into Brexit from a fundamentally different economic starting point than for a no-deal Brexit in 2019’. Photograph:  Niall CarsonPA Households and businesses may not have the capacity to withstand a second economic shock as a result of a hard Brexit at the end of the year, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has been warned, as the Government intensifies its planning for the UK’s departure from the EU.Given the economic damage already wrought by Covid-19, Mr Coveney has been warned that Ireland is “facing into Brexit from a fundamentally different economic starting point than for a no-deal Brexit in 2019”. In official briefing documents given to the Minister as he resumed office following the formation of Government, officials also told him that protecting the €85 billion trade link with Britain will be “vital to our overall economic recovery” and that Ireland needs to build a new relationship with the UK and with British cabinet ministers. Officials warned that “the capacity of households and businesses to manage a second economic shock will be more limited” in light of the pandemic. The Government is also hoping that a “landing zone” for major outstanding issues in Brexit talks can be found in September or October but, at present, the gap between the UK and the European Union remains “wide”. Contingency plansAll Government departments are intensifying Brexit contingency plans and a new Brexit Omnibus Bill will be brought to the Oireachtas after the summer recess. “The gap between the EU and UK positions remains wide, including on key issues such as the level playing field, fisheries, police and judicial co-operation and governance. “For progress to be achieved, it will be necessary for the UK position to move considerably in the direction of what they had agreed to under the political declaration. “The political declaration sets out the parameters for ‘an ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership’. However, in negotiations, the UK has adopted a significantly less ambitious approach,” the briefing says. The October European Council and discussions held in advance will be “crucial in identifying the landing zone for a possible agreement and on implementation of the protocol”. Officials have said that despite the continuing uncertainty on the future relationship between the UK and EU, the Irish Government should now work to develop a new relationship with the UK. “Driving a renewal of the relationship is a priority task, given its importance in terms of our joint stewardship of the Good Friday Agreement, our people-to-people relations, and the Ireland-Great Britain economic and trading relationship worth €85 billion per annum, the protection of which will be vital to our overall economic recovery.” It says, as part of that, “identifying how best to build relationships across the new British cabinet and wider political system will be important”. “In terms of immediate contacts, there has been good East-West communication on Covid responses, which could usefully continue. “Engagement to protect Irish interests will also continue to be necessary, as the final picture of the UK’s future relationship with the EU emerges.” Officials have recommended the establishment of a new consulate in the north of England.In terms of Ireland’s relationship with the US, officials said that “developing our bilateral relationship with the US will take place against the backdrop of difficult policy issues relating to immigration, trade and transatlantic relations”. It said EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan was “committed to progressing an EU-US trade deal and Ireland is well placed to play a role in this”. The Minister was also asked to focus on “close engagement with the Trump and Biden election campaigns in the lead-up to the November US presidential election”. On the relationship between Ireland and Canada, Mr Coveney was told that “ramping up the relationship with Canada will be a key component of our economic response to the disruption caused by the pandemic”.

Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer US president Barack Obama speaking during the funeral of late civil rights leader John Lewis in Atlanta on Thursday. Photograph:  Alyssa PointerPoolAFP via Getty ImagesBarack Obama called for sweeping reform to US voting laws during his eulogy at the funeral of civil rights activist and veteran congressman John Lewis, in one of his biggest political interventions since leaving the White House.“I know this is a celebration of John’s life. There are some who might say we shouldn’t dwell on such things. But that is why I’m talking about them,” Mr Obama, the former Democratic president, said at Lewis’s funeral service in Atlanta on Thursday.He demanded national laws to expand early voting, automatic voter register for all Americans, and making election day a national holiday.Mr Obama’s comments came just hours after President Donald Trump suggested November’s US presidential election should be delayed, repeating unsubstantiated claims that the vote would be marred by fraud due to more mail-in ballots. Republican lawmakers have swiftly rejected the idea.Mr Trump did not attend Lewis’s funeral. Mr Obama was joined at the event by former presidents George W Bush, a Republican, and Democrat Bill Clinton. The only other living former US president, Democrat Jimmy Carter, who is 95, sent a letter that was read at the service.Lewis first rose to national prominence more than half a century ago, in August 1963 during the March on Washington to advocate for the civil and economic rights of African Americans. He died earlier this month at the age of 80.Lewis was arrested some 40 times while protesting against segregation, and subjected to several life-threatening beatings, including notably on “Bloody Sunday” in March 1965 in Selma, Alabama. He later served as a Democrat in the US House of Representatives for more than 30 years, until his death.His body lay in state at the US Capitol in Washington earlier this week before Thursday’s funeral at the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where Martin Luther King Jr was a pastor in the 1960s.On Thursday morning, The New York Times published an essay written by Lewis shortly before his death. The civil rights activist said he was “inspired” by protests following the killing of George Floyd, writing: “You filled me with hope about the next chapter of the great American story when you used your power to make a difference in our society.”Mr Obama was the final speaker at a lengthy service that included eulogies from Lewis’s family, friends and colleagues, including Mr Bush and Mr Clinton, as well as Nancy Pelosi, Democratic speaker of the House.The former president has largely shied away from political statements since leaving office, though he has returned to the public eye in recent months in support of Joe Biden, his former vice-president, who will be Mr Trump’s Democratic opponent at the ballot box.Pointed criticismsMr Obama offered some of his most pointed criticisms of the incumbent to date on Thursday, lashing out at the Trump administration even if he did not directly name the president.“Bull Connor may be gone, but today we witness with our own eyes police officers kneeling on the necks of black Americans. George Wallace may be gone, but we can witness our federal government sending agents to use tear gas and batons against peaceful demonstrators,” Mr Obama said, referencing both staunch segregationists of the past and recent government actions following Floyd’s killing.The former president added: “We may no longer have to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar in order to cast a ballot, but even as we sit here, there are those in power who are darnedest to discourage people from voting by closing polling locations, and targeting minorities and students with restrictive ID laws, and attacking our voting rights with surgical precision, even undermining the postal service in the run-up to an election that is going to be dependent on mail-in ballots so people don’t get sick.”Mr Obama called for a new “John Lewis Voting Rights Act” that he said should include a provision “making sure every American is automatically registered to vote, including former inmates, who have earned their second chance”.Voting access for former felons has proved highly contentious. Earlier this month, the US supreme court declined to restore voting rights for ex-convicts in Florida, a key battleground state that is often decisive in presidential elections.National holidayMr Obama also called for more polling places and early voting, as well as a law making election day a national holiday “so if you are somebody who is working in a factory, or you are a single mom who has got to go to her job, and doesn’t get time off, you can still cast your ballot”.The former president endorsed statehood for Washington DC and Puerto Rico, called for an end to partisan gerrymandering – the drawing of congressional districts to favour specific political parties – and endorsed scrapping the filibuster, an arcane Senate rule that can delay or block laws from being passed.“If all of this takes eliminating the filibuster, another Jim Crow relic, in order to secure the God-given rights of every American, then that is what we should do,” Mr Obama said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"uk facing second coronavirus wave no sign one yet scientists","story":"Put simply, if you test more people, you\u0027ll see more cases.Professor Karol Sikora, the dean of medicine at the University of Buckingham, said: We\u0027re processing 10 times as many tests a day now. The average ticked up today, and cases certainly aren\u0027t falling, but we do need some context.An increase in localised outbreaks is also entirely expected at the end of a pandemic, and experts say cases are now so low that, if these levels were happening without knowledge of coronavirus, nobody would have spotted the new disease.Professor Carl Henegehan, director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University, said: Across the board, normal life is not resuming because we\u0027re still instilling a sense of fear in the community when cases are very low.If we didn\u0027t have testing now we wouldn\u0027t even be considering it a problem, because it\u0027s so low. If this was an influenza outbreak, we would have called it finished by now and said we were through this wave, and we would have started to get back to normal.  That\u0027s very pertinent to the \u0027second wave\u0027 talk from the Government now.  You cannot scare people to death and expect there to be no repercussions.Before lockdown was eased, experts warned that an ongoing endemic level of disease was a price we may have to pay for getting the economy and health service back on track.

even when an appointment was available.Meanwhile, researchers said depression and anxiety levels, life satisfaction and happiness have all shown improvements across every socio-demographic group.Loneliness levels have also decreased further, but there is little change in people reporting major or minor stress due to catching Covid-19, unemployment, finance, or getting food, according to the study.Cheryl Lloyd, education programme head at the Nuffield Foundation, said: With concerns growing over a second wave of Covid-19 it is concerning that many people in England report not understanding the current Government guidance.As another Nuffield-funded study by the Reuters Institute has shown, people are less likely to access news about Covid-19 on a daily basis now that lockdown has eased.With the rules changing regularly, this may be a factor in the public not understanding the Government guidance.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 31st july 2020","story":"People enjoy the hot weather on Perranporth Beach, Cornwall, UK, on a very hot day in the southwest.Politics latest news: Matt Hancock denies Northern lockdown aimed at EidCoronavirus latest news: Government will not \u0026#39shy away\u0026#39 from more lockdown measures if needed Travel updates: Portugal reopens nightclubs yet country remains on quarantine listUS election 2020: Barack Obama calls for end to voter suppression in John Lewis eulogyComment: The luxury living I saw migrants getting on arrival shows the scale of the scandalGovernment to ask for permission to appeal against Shamima Begum rulingPrince Andrew lobbied US government for \u0026#39favourable\u0026#39 Epstein plea deal, court documents claim Is the UK tracking the same trajectory as Spain\u0026#39s \u0026#39second wave\u0026#39?Ghislane Maxwell had sex with girls as young as 15, court documents claimSecond wave fears: How concerned should we be about a coronavirus resurgence?\u0026#39The NHS is not fit for purpose\u0026#39 -

I don’t know how much he’d be able to help you with, but seeing as he’s in a lot of trouble himself these days I think he might, so I think he might be valuable.Ms Giuffre, now 36, claims that she was forced to have sex with Epstein, who in turn forced her to have sex with a number of his associates. Epstein instructed Jane Doe to give Prince Andrew whatever he demanded and required her to report back to him on the details of the sexual abuse, the lawyers said. Maxwell faciliatated Epstein’s acts of sexual abuse by acting as a madam.Ms Giuffre in other parts of the testimony says the now famous photo of Prince Andrew with his arm around her waist in a London mansion was taken by Epstein on her Kodak camera. She says she gave the picture to the FBI during their investigations in 2011.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel updates portugal reopens nightclubs yet country remains","story":"Tui will not be flying any customers to Mallorca until at least August 10The face mask rules in your favourite European holiday destinations Holiday quarantine: Which country will be next?

I\u0027m one of these people that\u0027s always working, even if I\u0027m on holiday I keep in touch by email. I manage a team so I have responsibility but because I\u0027ve been on furlough I\u0027ve had to be completely cut off. “They turned off my emails overnight. I felt like I\u0027d had a limb chopped off. I went from being busy getting up in the morning to nothing. Not going out at all.”What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safely“Now I\u0027m back on Monday and it\u0027s quite a strange sensation. The only buildings I\u0027ve been in in the last four months are my house, the hospital and the dentist. I\u0027ve not even been in a shop.”Keane is far from alone. Among all of the 2.2 million people who have been shielding, 43 per cent have not left their home and garden, according to figures compiled by a coalition of charities including Diabetes UK and Age UK.The charities wrote to the chancellor on Friday calling for protections for 595,000 clinically vulnerable people who normally work, to ensure they are not pressured to go back to unsafe workplaces.Keane thinks the government should encourage a more staged reintroduction to workplaces for people who have been shielding.Constant changes to government guidance have given mixed messages which have served to undermine the confidence of many people who are shielding, he says.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That hasn\u0027t helped the shielding community at all.“We had the changes from 2-metre to 1-metre social distancing, then people were allowed to travel and we see Bournemouth beach packed, there was the face mask fiasco and now they\u0027ve said this week people coming back from Spain have to quarantine, having said a few days before that they didn’t.”“It’s a big step. I’ve got a real mixture of emotions.He says he feels his employer has done what it can to implement social distancing measures, increase cleaning, introduced hand sanitiser stations hygiene and help people stay safe at work.“Until I go back, I just don\u0027t know. It\u0027s going to be suck it and see. But the shipping industry is pretty good on health and safety. Many others are not so fortunate. Cancer patients ‘forced to choose between health or finances’One in seven workers with a lung condition feel so unsafe that they say they will refuse to return to their workplace, even if this means they lose their job, according to a survey by Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation.One third of the 8,500 people polled do not believe their workplace is or will be “Covid-secure”. Almost seven in 10 of those who said they were concerned about going back to work said they believe they will have to do so anyway.The government has published guidelines for employers to follow, but Keane believes the messages on what “Covid-secure” actually means have been unclear and contradictory.Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation are urging employers to be understanding with their employees who have a lung condition and engage with their inidual needs. This could include an ongoing option to work at home or redeployment to a lower risk role.The charities are among a growing chorus of voices calling on government to do more.Chris Askew, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: “No one should be faced with the impossible task of choosing between their health, by returning to work in an unsafe environment, and their financial security.“The government must ensure that employers are supported to take all the necessary measures to keep all employees safe if they are expected to attend work outside their home. “In addition, the government should introduce a new support scheme for those clinically vulnerable people who are unable to return to a safe work environment.”Sarah MacFadyen, head of policy at Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, wants the government to consider extending the furlough scheme for people who have been shielding, but so far the government has ignored that call.“This group of people have already made huge sacrifices and need to be to be supported to make their own personal decision about whether to return to the workplace.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez was meeting later Friday with the leaders of Spain\u0027s regions to discuss how to rebuild the economy and where to deploy billions of euros in European Union aid for recovery.Spain in mid-March went into a more than three-month lockdown, bringing much economic activity to a halt, as Covid-19 cases and deaths surged. The lockdown ended 21 June.France also reported a precipitous 14 per cent contraction in the second quarter when the country was in lockdown.In France, the startling plunge of 13.8 per cent in April-June from the previous three-month period also starkly illustrated the punishing economic cost of its two-month lockdown. It was the third consecutive quarter of economic contraction in France\u0027s worsening recession. The pain has been so damaging to jobs and industries that the government is talking down the possibility of another nationwide lockdown as infections tick upward again.The latest official figures for the UK showed a 25 per cent plunge in GDP during March and April but there are signs that a partial recovery has begun.The chief economist of the Bank of England, Andy Haldane, said earlier this month that the UK’s economy has recovered around half of its massive fall in output during the coronavirus lockdown.Andy Haldane said Britain has seen a V-shaped recovery, telling parliament’s Treasury Committee: “Roughly half of the roughly 25 per cent fall in activity during March and April has been clawed back over the period since.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Potential uses of the helicopter could include scouting ahead of human explorers and  investigating caves and craters. It could also be used to carry small payloads across the planet.Life could exist beneath the surface of Mars, study claimsBy the way, we just had an earthquake in this room, MiMi Aung said. Although objects were rattled, but there has been no significant effects on the launch of the rocket.On Nasa\u0027s livestream, Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine noted it was lucky that the rocket was not launching from Vandenberg Air Force Base, which is also in California and has seen Nasa launches before.Many viewers commented on Twitter that the earthquake was a benefit, as it woke them up in time to watch the Perseverance mission launch.Nasa can only go to Mars once every 26 months, so missing this launch window would mean a cost of half a billion dollars to maintain the rover before it could launch again.The trip to Mars had already been delayed twice before, because of contamination problems and issues with a crane at the pad.More news can be found on The Independent\u0027s liveblog of the launch.The Nasa mission will send the rover Perseverence to search for traces of potential alien life.The car-sized six-wheeled robotic rover, ]will launch atop an Atlas 5 rocket from the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance.Officials indicated that all systems appeared ready to go ahead of the launch, with weather forecasts from the Air Force\u0027s 45th Weather Squadron remaining at an 80 percent probability of launch and fuelling preparations underway for the rocket.Perseverance is due to land at the base of an 820-foot-deep (250 meters) crater called Jezero, a former lake from 3.5 billion years ago that scientists suspect could bear evidence of potential past microbial life on Mars. Scientists have long debated whether Mars - once a much more hospitable place than it is today - ever harboured life.Why Nasa\u0027s new Mars rover will be its best yetWater is considered a key ingredient for life, and the Martian surface billions of years ago had lots of it on the surface before the planet became a harsh and desolate outpost.However, scientists are unsure whether alien life could have survived in the water. Although the waters in Martian lakes appear to have a similar pH to that in Earth\u0027s oceans, other scientists have argued that it would be far too cold for life to survive.One of the most complex manoeuvres in Perseverance\u0027s journey will be what mission engineers call the “seven minutes of terror,” when the robot endures extreme heat and speeds during its descent through the Martian atmosphere, deploying a set of supersonic parachutes before igniting mini rocket engines to gently touch down on the planet\u0027s surface.It is the latest launch from Earth to Mars during a busy month of July, following probes sent by the United Arab Emirates and China.Aboard Perseverance is a four-pound (1.8 kg) autonomous helicopter named Ingenuity that is due to test powered flight on Mars for the first time.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Matt Hancock has claimed his last-minute imposition of new coronavirus restrictions in northern England was “crystal clear”, after his late-evening tweets sparked confusion among regional leaders. “It is absolutely crystal clear ... what the new rules are and we’ve brought them in to target specifically the problems we’ve been able to see through the data,” he said.But Sir Keir Starmer called the manner of the announcement – a Twitter thread at 9.30pm yesterday – a “new low” for government communications.Labour also criticised Boris Johnson’s claim that the UK had had “massive success” in reducing coronavirus deaths, which he made on the day statistics showed England had Europe’s worst excess mortality rate for the first half of the year. The PM was “delusional”, the opposition said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPM\u0027s claim of \u0027massive success\u0027 is delusional, says LabourShielded population in NI told they can now venture outThe shielding period for some 80,000 vulnerable people in Northern Ireland has ended.People with serious medical conditions like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis can go out for the first time since March as coronavirus restrictions ease.Ministers are encouraging shoppers to wear face masks to limit virus spread and the measure could be enforced by law later next month if not enough people comply voluntarily.Robin Swann, the Stormont health minister, said: Many of those who have been shielding will understandably be nervous about leaving their homes for sometimes what will be the last time so we can all play our part in assuring them by showing kindness and consideration.Tui extends holiday suspensionTour operator Tui has extended the suspension of holidays for UK customers to mainland Spain until 17 August, and the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands until 10 August.The company said it would\u0026nbspinstead add more flights to Greece and Turkey following the overwhelming demand from customers to still get away this summer.Indonesia updateIndonesia reported\u0026nbsp2,040 new coronavirus infections and 73 additional deaths, on Friday. This brought its total number of confirmed infections to 108,376 and deaths to 5,131.French authorities can mandate mask-wearingLocal government officials in France will now be able to make wearing face masks in outdoor public spaces mandatory to curb the spread of Covid-19.This decision can be taken locally, depending on the situation of the epidemic in each region, Olivier Veran, the health minister, said on Twitter.French authorities reported 1,377 additional confirmed cases of the new coronavirus on Thursday, bringing the total to 186,573.Dutch airline cuts 5,000 jobs despite bailoutDutch airline\u0026nbspKLM is to cut up to 5,000 jobs because of coronavirus , it said on Friday.The move comes after\u0026nbspthe European Commission approved a bailout package of €3.4bn (£3bn) in loans offered by the Dutch government to help the company navigate the crisis.The company said in a statement that in addition to cutting 1,500 roles, it would decline to review some 1,500 temporary contracts\u0026nbspand that 2,000 further jobs would go via a voluntary redundancy scheme.The group also expects natural attrition through retirement to help cut an extra 500 jobs.KLM said it does not expect demand to fully recover before 2023 or 2024 and said further staff reductions are possible given the high level of uncertainty.Hong Kong elections may be delayed, reports sayHong Kong may postpone\u0026nbsplegislative elections scheduled for 6 September due to a worsening Covid-19 outbreak, according to local media reports.An announcement could come as soon as Friday evening, multiple Hong Kong newspapers and TV stations said. They all cited unnamed sources.It would be a blow to\u0026nbspthe pro-democracy opposition, which hopes to capitalise on disenchantment with the current pro-Beijing majority to make gains.A group of 22 politicians issued a statement accusing the government of using the outbreak as an excuse to delay the vote.The city of 7.5 million people has seen a surge in coronavirus infections since the beginning of July. There were more than\u0026nbsp3,100 infections as of Thursday, more than double the tally at the start of the month.Vietnam records first death after virus surgeVietnam has confirmed its first death from coronavirus, state media reported on friday.A 70-year-old man died after testing positive in Danang, the city where the virus re-emerged last week after 100 days of quiescence.Vietnam is battling a new outbreak of the virus following months of successful countermeasures which saw the country keep its coronavirus tally to just a few hundred cases.Authorities\u0026nbspreported 45 new infections on Friday, marking Vietnam\u0027s biggest one-day increase and\u0026nbspbringing the total to 509.Households can travel to meet up, Hancock admitsA household in an area affected by his new rules\u0026nbspcould travel to another household outside of the affected areas as long as social distancing guidelines are followed, Matt Hancock has said.The health secretary told the BBC: The law is that two households cannot meet in the affected area but obviously this is about having social distancing in place.Strictly, the law we\u0027re bringing in is that two households cannot meet in the area defined but obviously any two households that are meeting should follow social distancing guidelines.Manchester MP \u0027inundated\u0027 with questions on new rulesLucy Powell, the Manchester Central MP, has told Times Radio her constituents are baffled by Matt Hancock\u0027s last-minute new rules.She said they included people questioning whether they are able to visit elderly relatives they are looking after who live outside of the restricted area, and whether they can go on holiday with another household elsewhere.I\u0027ve been inundated with questions that I don\u0027t know the answers to them, she said.Hancock gives more detailTwo households can still meet at a social distance in a public place outdoors such as a park where there is lots of space, Matt Hancock has said, but meeting another household in pub gardens or outdoor restaurant space is not allowed under his new rules for the northwest.Asked about the prospect of crowds gathering together too closely in Friday\u0027s heat, the health secretary told the BBC: It\u0027s so important that people follow social distancing rules. My message is people need to keep doing that.We\u0027ve shown we\u0027re prepared to take action if that\u0027s necessary.Having just announced this action last night I don\u0027t this morning want to talk about what more we might do, but we have shown we\u0027re prepared to take action.Germany infections risingGermany reported 870 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Friday, according to a tally from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases.It brought the total number to 208,698. Some 9,141 deaths have been recorded.The new figure was well up on daily tallies from earlier this week - there were 340 on Monday and 633 on Tuesday.The average number of daily infections is rising, compared to last month.More from HancockWe\u0027re not seeing as much transmission in terms of people in their place of work or going to retail or other areas, and so we are able to put in place this specific action.We\u0027re not restricting travel, so people can still go on holiday from the area affected. We\u0027re not putting in any restrictions to work.Hancock claims new rules \u0027crystal clear\u0027Matt Hancock has defended his late-night Twitter announcement of the new lockdown rules in northern England by saying we are moving quickly in some circumstances to react to Covid-19\u0027s spread.When you face a pandemic like this it is important sometimes to move quickly, the health secretary told Sky News when challenged on the wisdom of his communications strategy.I understand the impact of decisions like these, he added. I understand that this is not the sort of decision anybody would want to take.Mr Hancock was challenged on the allegedly confusing nature of the restrictions, given that although households cannot meet indoors, pubs and hairdressers can remain open.He said: It is absolutely crystal clear ... what the new rules are and we\u0027ve brought them in to target specifically the problems that we\u0027ve been able to see through the data.We want to do it with minimum impact. The evidence shows that the biggest risk in terms of the spread of the virus across this area is household transmission, where people are going to see each other in each other\u0027s homes when they\u0027re not in a household together, and also visiting friends and relatives.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I can tell you that if I made any of my films, I don’t think I’d last. I’d be vilified. I’d be attacked. Shamed.

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots. Keep these four points in mind when preparing for your next staycation…CHECK THE GUIDELINES: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all have different rules in place check their respective tourism sites before you travelBOOK IN ADVANCE: If you’re visiting an attraction, book slots in advance where possibleGO OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: Try to visit less popular places and to avoid overcrowded areasPACK YOUR BAGS: Bring a card for contactless payments and always keep hand sanitiser on youTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You GoPlease keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I literally got the message at his memorial so it was a double crappy day\u0027\u0026nbsp“I have lost five kilos in the last three or four weeks because of stress and because work has been so hostile,” Lottie Pope tells The Independent. “I feel like it is bullying. I go to bed at 11pm and wake up at 3am and can’t go back to sleep because my brain is frantic. It is exploding with stress.”Ms Pope, a former social media manager for an insurance firm, was recently laid off from her job during the public health emergency and believes she was discriminated against for being a mother.A spate of recent studies have suggested the coronavirus crisis is exacerbating gender inequality - with a report by the University of Exeter finding women are almost twice as likely as men to have lost their job during the pandemic. Researchers found seven per cent of women have been made redundant during the lockdown in comparison to four per cent of men.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile a report by PwC, published in May, found 78 per cent of those who had already lost their jobs as a result of the Covid-19 emergency were women.“At the beginning of the lockdown, we were asked to take a 20 per cent pay cut,” Ms Pope, who lives in Tunbridge Wells, says. “I said: \u0027I can’t afford that because I’ve got childcare to pay for\u0027. And then they said: \u0027You have a choice to be put on furlough or be made redundant\u0027. It was a punishment. I also asked them if could I reduce my hours by 20 per cent because I was homeschooling but they expected me to still be full-time.”The women facing lockdown burnout as they juggle jobs with childcareThe 30-year-old, who is a single parent, said hours earlier she had been told she was “critical” to the company and would be working throughout the crisis. But her bosses attitude changed dramatically when she did not agree to take the pay cut, she added.“Social media is a critical, vital thing which can definitely be done from home,“ the mother-of-one adds. ”I had a junior person below me and they kept the junior person. She doesn’t have kids. I feel like it was a case of them discriminating against me because I have a child. I was homeschooling and working full time from home at the beginning of the lockdown. It was so stressful. Now I’m not sleeping at all. I feel really highly strung and I’m very worried about money. I’ve filed a grievance. I can’t take them to an employment tribunal because I worked there for under two years.”A recent London School of Economics study found women are more likely than men to lose their jobs in the forthcoming recession because a greater proportion work in sectors that are forecast to be most badly affected. More women work in hospitality, leisure, tourism and the arts — industries where thousands of workers have already been furloughed or made redundant.Jamie Bird, who lives in West London and previously worked in the education sector, was furloughed in March before being laid off in June.  “I was laid off on the anniversary of my best friend\u0027s death,” the 38-year-old adds. I literally got the message at his memorial so it was a double crappy day. I\u0027ve been feeling pretty down since losing the job. I don\u0027t have any kids but it\u0027s affected my mental health a lot. I\u0027ve lost a job and a relationship so it\u0027s been hard dealing with both. I don\u0027t sleep as well because obviously I\u0027m worried about finding another job and how I\u0027m going to pay for bills and other expenses.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe gender bias revealed by coronavirus needs fixingMs Bird said the current job market is “awful” and she fears she is being discriminated against due to her age - adding that it feels like employers are taking on apprentices due to them being cheaper than someone who has more experience.“I applied for universal credit but was denied any for reasons they haven\u0027t explained so I\u0027m out of a job with no income and no help and that\u0027s tough,” she adds. “I think that it\u0027s atrocious that women are more likely to lose their job in the pandemic than men, we work equally as hard and sometimes even harder and yet we still don\u0027t seem to have bridged that gap between being treated as equally in the workplace environment.” Gemma Hirst, who lives in Newcastle, has been forced to start claiming universal credit since losing her job in retail during the coronavirus crisis.“I worked for the clothes company for five years and got promoted,” the 25-year-old says. “During lockdown, I got furloughed. A couple of months down the line, the shop I was at was closing down but they said I could be moved to another store. But they cut my hours and demoted me so I was no longer a supervisor. I didn’t want that so they made me redundant”.Ms Hirst said she had never lost a job before or been without work but she lucky enough to live with her parents - adding that if she was living alone, the universal credit would not be enough to live on.“It would be a tough existence,” she says. “It is scary because there are hardly any jobs out there. When I apply for jobs I get emails saying that the application is on pause due to the pandemic. I have no idea what would happen if I didn\u0027t have family. It doesn’t bear thinking about. I think I would be homeless. I have good days and bad days. There are some days where I think ‘what am I going to do?’ and I am anxious about the future and worried about what is to come.”She said her best friend, who has three children, had been catapulted into a state of panic since being laid off from her job in a care home for the elderly.  “She was struggling to get childcare and her employer said we don’t want you,” Ms Hirst adds. “She was crying. She is a wreck because she has three children to look after on her own.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s hard to imagine what could be more significant than this.”Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy, whose Wigan seat is affected by the measures, said: “We were told more information would be published ‘as fast as possible’. It is deeply frustrating and I appreciate it is really hard to follow rules that aren’t clear. “What we were told is that Covid rates are rising so please do what you can and we will keep pressing for clarity.”Ahead of Eid celebrations Manchester Gorton MP Afzal Khan said he understood that communal prayers in mosques can go ahead to mark the day, but there must be no visitors to people’s homes.“I urge you to follow the restrictions – they are there to keep us all safe and secure,” he said in a message to constituents. “Eid mubarak.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That allows researchers to build up a picture of all matter in the universe, of which some 90 per cent is invisible, made up of dark matter and tenuous gas.That in turn allows astronomers to watch the processes that gradually make the universe less homogenous, or evenly distributed: parts of the universe that have more than the usual mass attract matter from their areas around them, which makes them less similar to those other parts. The expansion of the universe counteracts that growth.Scientists find they don’t know how fast the universe is expandingSince both of those processes are driven by gravity, they can be used to test the standard model of cosmology and the assumptions underlying our physics. Since that allows us to predict the way that the variations in density would change as the universe aged, those predictions can be put to the test by examining how homogenous or differently clumped the universe really is.The new study found, however, that those predictions were wrong. The universe is almost 10 per cent more homogenous than our current understanding of physics suggests.Like other recent findings, such as the mysterious discrepancy in the expansion rate of the universe or Hubble constant, the data could be yet another crack in the standard model of physics, and could require us to rethink our picture of the universe.“The question is whether these can be solved with a small adjustment, for example with a somewhat more complex behavior of dark matter than the simple hypothesis of totally inert ‘cold dark matter\u0027, said Tilman Tröster, from the University of Edinburgh, in a statement.But the change could be far more fundamental, suggesting for instance that Einstein’s general theory of relativity could need replacing.The researchers behind the new observations were keen to stress that their focus was on accurately taking the measurements, rather than making any leaps about what they could tell us about the universe – or what they could tell us about what we have got wrong about it.As an observing cosmologist, you try to remain impartial and make the measurements as accurate as possible without theoretical prejudices, said Hendrik Hildebrandt from Ruhr University Bochum.One thing is clear: we live in exciting times!”Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Former IMF chief Christine Lagarde has praised female leaders around the world for their “stunning” response to the coronavirus pandemic, especially when compared to their male counterparts.Ms Lagarde, who now heads the European Central Bank, said the policies adopted by female heads of state were proactive and their communication style was clear.“I would say that for myself I’ve learned that women tend to do a better job,” she said. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe added: “This is my woman’s bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias.”The top 10 worst affected countries are all led by men, both in terms of total number of cases and cases per million people.It is difficult to make a like-for-like comparison without considering factors like health expenditure, tourism and population density. There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders are risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

July  is the start of Eid al-Adha. It will last until August , .Eid al-Adha is celebrated on the th day of Dhū al-Hijjah, the twelfth and final month of the Islamic calendar.It lasts for four days. The first day of Eid al-Adha marks the end of the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Makkah.Due to Islam traditionally using the lunar calendar the date does sht and its not officially on until theres a clear enough sky showing the crescent of a new moon.This means that there is also a day-long iation between countries depending on where they are in the world.Eid usually starts with Muslims going to the Mosque for prayers in new finery.As the name would suggest, over the weekend there is usually the sacrice of a sheep, goat, camel or cow. The act is called Qurbani.In the period around Eid al-Adha, many Muslims travel to Mecca and the surrounding area in Saudi Arabia to perform the Hajj pilgrimage, which is one of the five pillars of Islam.It is a public holiday in traditionally or majority Muslim countries like Indonesia or the United Arab Emirates, but it isnt in more historically Christian countries like the UK.In the UK the animal is slaughtered in a slaughterhouse, but in other countries it is often done as part of a public ritual.It is a time that is spent visiting family and friends, usually involving a big meal and some partying. Kids often get presents too.The meat is shared equally between family, friends and the poor and unlike Eid al-Fitr, the meals made are predominantly savoury. It is a time when they visit family and friends. Muslims will also give money to charity so the less fortunate are also able to celebrate.There are two Eids, which makes things a bit confusing for those not brought up in Islam.Firstly, Eid means feast, so theyre both family gatherings and a good excuse for a party.Eid al-Fitr is celebrated at the end of Ramadan, this year it was in late May, to celebrate the end of fasting.Eid al-Fitr is often referred to as the sweet feast as Muslims will tend to put a greater emphasis on puddings. Eid al-Adha is the one thats coming up this Thursday and is the holier of the two feasts.It coincides with the end of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and is around two months after Eid al-Fitr.It is deemed the savoury or salty feast as there is a surplus of meat from the sacrice of the cattle that gets shared around everyone.Eid al-Adha sees the sacrices made as a symbolic act to mimic the near-sacrice of Ibrahimwho agreed to sacrice his son Ishmael when Allah God asked him to in repeated dreams.Ibrahim leads Ishmael to Mount Arafat, tied up his son and stuck a blindfold on so he wouldnt have to watch him suffer. The story goes that Allah replaced Ibrahim with a sheep as Ibrahim blindly flung the kne at his son. Other iations include an angel stepping in at the last moment and giving him a sheep or goat.This is the same story from the Old Testament of Abraham and Isaac.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She said to me ‘I’m worried I am sleeping on a dead body’.”A neighbour, who did not wish to be named, told the Mirror: “She is convinced Inga is under there. That cellar was built by a previous tenant.#Christian B removed the floorboards and jumped into it.#There was loads of rubbish inside and he added to it. The new tenant is in such a panic.#She has spent a week sleeping outside.#British cops have questioned the owner of a garage where Christian B worked as a car mechanic.Met Police officers investigating Madeleine McCann’s disappearance left with all paperwork relating to the German paedophile earlier this year.Christian B rented a garage at Euro Hobbywerkstatt in Hanover, a few miles from the allotment currently being excavated.The owner said yesterday detectives “took away everything” to do with him.The suspect modied his VW camper van to be able to hide a child, it is feared.The paedophile lived in the vehicle above a basement at an allotment in Hanover around the time three-year-old Madeleine disappeared.He once boasted he could have used his VW campervan to transport children.Dein Ghafou, who owned a garage complex Hanover used by Christian B, told police: “I told them he had been working on a ­Volkswagen Camper here and he would lt the roof up and then make it smaller again,# he told the Mirror.“He was always cutting the roof, raising it and then lowering it. He came and went here.#Neighbours of Christian B at the allotment said he lived in the VW LT camper van in  and .There has been speculation that police will soon launch a search of another allotment kept by Christian B in the city of Braunschweig, around  miles east of Hanover.Christian B rented the land for around three years until , and for a time is thought to have lived in a single-storey building on the plot.The site is rumoured to have a cellar beneath it similar to the one found beneath the allotment in Hanover.Forensic officers and snfer dog have spent three days hunting through the first known allotment owned by the convicted paedophile in Hanover, Germany.The main suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann buried USB sticks filled with child abuse images alongside his dead dog, reports say.The stash was reportedly found when police searched the site of an abandoned box factory where the alleged killer is known to have stayed in his caravan.The spot is only  miles away from the remote village of Neuwegersleben, where the abandoned box factory is situated.In February , more than  officers took part in a search of the site in search of Gehrickes body, German tabloid Bild reported.No body was uncovered, but police did dig up , pieces of potential evidence relating to other crimes and thought to have been buried by Christian B.Among that evidence is reported to a cache of child abuse images stored on a number of USB sticks which had been buried under a pile of animal bones.Christian B was prosecuted in relation to the images.Christian B has submitted another request for parole just days after withdrawing his application claiming he had lost confidence in the judicial system.The convicted rapist and paedophile was eligible for release in June after serving two thirds of a  month sentence for drugs trafficking.But his lawyer Friedrich Fulscher pulled that application saying he had no faith in the court that would consider the request as it was the same one that had convicted his client of rape.Last night Mr Fulscher, who has refused to speak with British media, told German news outlets he had resubmitted the request but at the court in Kiel where Brueckner is currently jailed.The U turn came just days after he definitely announced no charges would be brought against Brueckner and that prosecutors were chasing up a blind alley.An allotment being searched in Germanys Hanover is an hours drive from the town of Braunschweig, the last fixed home of Christian B.The public prosecutors office in Braunschweig told The Sun

working in a car repair shop before being convicted of forgery of documents that same year.Hanover’s district court sentenced Christian B for falsying documents in , and then three years later he was sentenced for a joint theft.Christian B is a lelong paedo who chased a fantasy playboy lestyle to cover up his warped sex crimes, The Sun reported last month.The German criminal was first convicted of abusing children aged  back in  – a year before he is believed to have moved to Portugal.He moved to Braunschweig in  and opened a kiosk in the city, which is around  miles from Hanover.Staff at the kiosk recalled his bizarre and chilling behaviour.A former neighbour of the career criminal said he was “often very aggressive”.The woman who uses a second plot linked to Christian B, Sabine Sellig, has urged police to come and search the site.Her friend Thomas Tager told The Sun: “She is terried.“She has begged police to come with search dogs.“She said to me ‘I’m worried I am sleeping on a dead body’.”Its been reported by Bild that Christian B. leased a second garden plot, in Braunschweig.He is said to have rented it from the Kennelblick Allotment Garden Association from October  until April

cross word” with him.Recalling he owned a Mercedes sprinter van and had two dogs, Mr Kruimstoh told The Sun: “His departure from here in  was strange.“He gave me notice in the afternoon, got into his packed, small car, and after that I never heard from him again.“Naturally there is a good deal of speculation about whether the police want to dig here like they have been doing in Hanover.”This

The -year-old child sex fiend, who is the prime suspect in the search for Madeleine McCann, lived at the isolated garden house for three years after quitting the kiosk he ran.Locals are now urging police to come and dig at the site after they uncovered a cellar at his other garden in Hanover last night, some  miles away.The single storey building is at the end of a track close to a railway line in Braunschweig.Christian B lived on site there between  and  and was often seen with girlfriend Nakscije Mtari.He occupied the land at the same time when five-year-old Inga Gehricke, dubbed the ‘German Maddie’, vanished from a nearby forest during a family barbecue.The site is rumoured to have a cellar beneath it # just like the one dramatically discovered in Hanover yesterday.The Sun uncovered what appears to be a boarded up well at the property this morning. German police who searched a garden on the outskirts of Hannover, northern Germany, used excavators, snfer dogs, shovels and rakes to investigate the plot.Investigators put up two tents and continued to dig even further into the ground after they had cut down trees and bushes earlier this week, the German news agency dpa reported.Prosecutors did not say what the investigators were looking for.At the garden plot, investigators even removed parts of the foundation of a former cabin from the ground that once stood there, dpa reported.A man on a neighbouring plot told the news agency that the garden, where blackberry bushes and a cheery tree grow, had not been used for the last two years.The site was previously home to a German suspect linked to Madeleines disappearance.A hidden cellar that was discovered during a search for clues in relation to missing Madeleine McCann has been completely filled in with sand.Updated site pics show the garden has been cleared of vegetation, and covered in sand.The abandoned German allotment has this week been the scene of an intense search by about  cops and forensic experts, which started on Monday night and has now ended.A picture taken on July  shows a sign on one tree reading “No entry to the property. Parents are liable for their children” after the police finished a three-day search in the northern German city of Hanover.Cops in Germany could swoop on a second allotment plot rented by twisted Christian B after the new owner admitted: “I’m worried I’m sleeping over a dead body.”Neighbours said the woman who now owns the plot, Sabine Sellig, recently urged police to come and dig her land.Her friend Thomas Tager told The Sun: “She is terried.“She has begged police to come with search dogs.

Soon after, Portuguese prosecutors ordered the case to be reopened by local police.The new inquiry led Portuguese police to interview four suspects, but they were later cleared of any involvement, and a search by British detectives of wasteland near Praia da Luz also failed to provide a breakthrough.In June , British and German police said they had identied a new suspect in the case, a -year-old German man. Prime suspect Christian B lived in the Algarve between  and  and burgled hotels and holiday flats as well as trading drugs.The underground cellar found by a -strong team of cops and forensic officers in a Hanover, Germany, allotment had a reinforced concrete foundation, reports TV channel RTL.A local journalist told the broadcaster they assumed it was an old cold cellar # an underground pit to store the likes of fruit and veg in a cooler environment.Excavators, drones and snfer dogs helped the three-search, which began on Monday and ended last night as the hunt for clues in relation to the abduction of Madeleine McCann continues.German sex offender Christian B, who is currently serving time for drug offences, is being investigated following Madeleine McCann’s disappearance during her family holiday in Praia da Luz, Portugal in .He is a prolic burglar, who has previous convictions for sex crimes against young girls.The prime suspect was already known to British and Portuguese police.Christian B has  child sex convictions and is known to have videoed victims.Yet recent information came from a witness who stepped forward following the appeal by the Met Police on the tenth anniversary in .He is in jail in Kiel on drugs charges and is appealing a conviction for the rape of a -year-old.The Madeleine McCann suspect has dropped his bid to be freed from prison early, claiming he is #losing faith# in the justice system.Convicted rapist and paedo Christian B, , applied for early release from a -month drugs trafficking sentence eight weeks ago, and was eligible after serving two-thirds of his sentence.His lawyer Friedrich Fulscher had filed the request but told a German press agency on Tuesday evening: My client had withdrawn his request.#He has lost faith in the judicial system.Christians dropping of his freedom bid was revealed in the same week evidence bags were removed from a garden in Hanover, Germany.Cops investigating the Brit youngsters disappearance dug up an allotment just four miles from Christian Bs former home.German TV channel RTL reports that television teams and photographers from the UK, France, Belgium and the Netherlands #among others” flocked to Hanover to cover the search for clues in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.But, the station added, not much is known as yet about the three-day probe of an abandoned allotment.

Teenagers, it turns out, are a bit of an ordeal.Studies show that mums and dads of teens are  per cent more stressed than  years ago.There’s not just the financial pressures from teens, the constant keepie-uppie with phones, computers and fashion, but the added pleasure of social media.Then throw into the mix hormones, curfews, risky behaviours, smoking, drinking and sex and you have a ­wonderful pottage of purgatory.When your children reach their teens they need to question your authority in order to find the impetus to break away and become independent adults. And they don’t do this lightly. No, they make sure they also judge and question your parenting and basically suck the le out of you.For most of us women it also often coincides with the menopause and ­possibly mid-le crises. I mean, could there be a more perfect storm  Unsurprisingly, girls are more antagonistic towards the female parent. And research shows the task of setting limits for their teenagers falls more to mothers than it does to fathers.I have four childrenand they are all very dferent. One no longer lives at home. He’s  and is my Goldenballs, as his teenage years really lulled me into a  sense of security, being largely painless.I also have two girls, aged  and , plus a boy of . So far . . . and I do love you, girls, BUT . . . the boys are proving simpler, less complicated. Unconscious bias, possibly.Lockdown with these hoodlums forced me to question my sanity, made me feel like I was in freefall and wonder what the hell I had been thinking all those times in the past when my ­Fallopian tubes would jump for joy as soon as I saw a man.I’m a liberal parent. I haven’t sought to make my children my “friends” but I ­certainly wasn’t prepared for the ­contempt, defiance, audacity and ­confrontation that has arrived. About everything, from changing the toilet rollto rudeness , politenessand lack of empathy . I’m not allowed to utter the words, “Well, when I was a teenager”, because allegedly I’ve never been one.I can’t offer advice because I “don’t understand”. I’m not allowed to discipline because that’s “damaging”.I’ve been reprimanded for calling one of the Ungratefuls “lazy”. In modern times, this is “injurious and prejudicial”, I was told. Yes, she used those words. I did once try to explain that she’s intelligent and could go far. “Intelligent” is also detrimental to her mental wellbeing, I was informed.Give me strength.At the beginning of lockdown, I would cry out loud and scream from time to time — just to let off steam because I felt utterly trapped.And because I was parenting on my own, I guess there is no need for orce or separation or marriage breakdown now.But I felt utterly blindsided by the scale of the task because teens nowadays are savvy buggers who are well versed in conversations about ious “conditions” everyone seems to be struggling with — mental health, eating disorders, anxiety.Which is great. But not so great when you’re trying to run through a minefield to get to the other side before they ­criticise your parenting abilities and make you feel like a complete sham.Things have improved slightly. It was that or murder. But it has sapped me of all my energy and made me question what I was thinking when I thought that having kids was a great idea.I joke, of course. They can bring me enormous pleasure when they actually do change the toilet roll. Butyou think weaning and sleep-training is tough, wait until you join the Bewildered Mum Of Teens Club.A very close friend of mine always used to say: “Small children, small problems. Big children, big problems.” So enjoy your little eight-pounder while you can.I exaggerate not when I say I’m sometimes scared to open my mouth at home because one of the Ungratefuls has been a ­passionate advocate of social justice since she first strung a sentence together. Often, I am jokingly and harmlessly inappropriate and un-PC, only succeeding in pushing my middle-age boundaries in a woke world of righteous fundamentalists. But it was when my -year-old Ungrateful sat at the table with a look of absolute panic on his face that I realised things have gone too far. All he had asked his ­sister was: “Can you pass the black pepper  Or is that racist ”I WAS disturbed to learn that the puppy Katie Price bought for her -year-old daughter Princess died in an accident at home. There’s more than one lesson there for a young girl, I would have thought.I was equally disturbed to learn there has been an increase in people buying puppies during lockdown – because apparently, what  is there to do  Except puppies require a lot of work and attention, demand constant ­surveillance and are sentient beings with needs that require a long-term emotional and financial commitment.I worry about how many of these pets will be surrendered or neglected once “normal le” resumes.And why people won’t consider ­adopting rescue dogs when shelters and rescue centres are brimming with ownerless animals.A dog is for le. Not just for lockdown.LOVELY newsreader George Alagiah said that when he first came to England from Ghana at the age of  and headed to boarding school, he made damn sure he had a cut-glass English accent in order to avoid racist and classist bullies.As a foreigner who arrived from Sweden at the same age, I had the same ambition – I wanted to sound like the locals and did not want to stand out.I became all the more determined after slipping up when getting “soup” and “soap” confused, mistaking a sofa “suite” for a sofa “suit” and always referring to spiders’ “cod webs”.It burned like hell to be laughed at because you couldn’t speak properly.Now, I’m pleased to say, my grammar and English is often better than my peers’ because I had to learn everything from scratch and I didn’t want to attract attention.Until I decided on a job in TV, that is.HANDSOME Viking eye-candy Dolph Lundgren has just got engaged. He turns  in November and his fiancée Emma Krokdal is .We shrug this off because a he’s a bloke, b age is just a number and c what is  years between two lovers Except when I was questioned ahead of my appearance on Celeb First Dates Hotel last year about what age range I would consider for a partner, without a pause I said: “Twenty-five to .” My daughters were HORRIFIED.I’m nearly  and the idea of an older woman with a far younger man is deemed unthinkable and distasteful. Yet a handsome man marrying an adolescent girl is much more palatable.Well, I’m not having it. Don’t you dare give me the side eye when I walk with my future -year-old beau! OK, a girl’s gotta dream.A ROBUST, toned, muscled, strapping, athletic, sturdy, brawny, vigorous, rippedman has been parading up and down Oxford Street in London in his birthday suit with his plumbing shielded only by a feeble face mask. He’s making a point.I was wonderinghe’d like to come and make that point in my town.Because I also think I need to adjust his mask a little.Just want to be helpful.FIRST Dates TV maitre d’ Fred Sirieix is hopelessly in love with his fiancée and has revealed he is having the best sex of his le at . He puts it all down to the fact he has a greater overall wisdom at his age and that he likes himself more than when he was in his twenties.As a mature woman who recently had to kickstart her sex engine after some barren years, I agree there is much truth to feeling a bit wiser with age.Butwe’re really honest, it probably has nothing to do with our maturity and all to do with the connection you make and the person you’re with.It’s nothing you can find on an app, on paper or via social media.It’s just there when you meet. And it takes your breath away.SWEDEN didn’t go into lockdown, preferring instead to keep the economy going with its obedient citizens.The Swedes have been pleased by the way their government have tackled the pandemic, so much so that a solid minority has decided to get tattoos of the chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell.

Leicester was also included in the ban, but previous more severe restrictions there will be lted so pubs and restaurants can open.The Department of Health confirmed it applies to all indoor settings - so it means although pubs and restaurants will remain open, two households cannot meet there.The hotspots were slapped with the special measure as part of the government’s strategy to use rolling localised lockdowns to try avoid a wider national second lockdown.Guidelines state that you can only socialise outside in groups of six people or less.Gatherings larger than six should only take placeeveryone is exclusively from two households or support bubbles, the guidelines state.You should also not interact socially with anyone outside the group you are spending time with - evenyou know them.The rules state that you should still not hold parties or large gatherings where it is dficult to maintain social distancing.The government said that gatherings of over  are still now allowed.The government pointed out that you should still not attendit is organised by a business or organisation that has implemented strict Covid- rules.You cannot stay overnight away from your home with members who are not part of your household.You are allowed to stay overnight with the person you have allocated to be in your support bubble.If you are unsure of the rules and regulations in your area then the government lists all localised restrictions here.You should always check before you travel as you may arrive at a city or town where residents from outside the area not allowed to enter.In most parts of the country shops, restaurants, bars and hair salons are open but in some places that have seen high case numbers, restrictions are still in place.On July  millions of Brits across Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and West Yorkshire were last night banned from meeting up indoors as ministers scrambled to stop Covid- “bubbling up”.The orders came as England was hit with  new positive cases - the highest number in  days - adding to fears the country is facing a second wave of the virus.When it comes to the things you can actually do the government has relaxed rules on grandparents seeing their grandchildren.Many families struggled with childcare at the beginning of lockdown and the introduction of social bubbles has allowed grandparents to spend quality time with their families.The use of a social bubble also means you dont have to adhere to social distancing and can hug the other person.The government guidance states: People from two dferent households can meet indoors, which enables you to spend time with your grandchildren. At this time, we still advise that people from dferent households avoid close contact so childcare should only be providedit is possible to socially distance from your grandchildren. If you have formed a support bubble with your grandchildren’s household, which is allowedeither you or they live in a ‘single adult household’, then there can be close contact and social distancing is not necessary.The guidance does however state that the social distancing policy is being kept under review.When it comes to older children parents are also now permitted to send their children to youth clubs but have been advised to make sure their children understand hand hygiene and do their best to implement social distancing.The use of face masks and coverings is also now mandatory in supermarkets, shops and on public transport.You may also be required to wear a mask in health care settings or in places like hairdressers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Whilst this agreement is very good news, we mustnt be complacent or over optimistic.The fact remains we may never get a vaccine andwe do get one, we have to be prepared that it may not be a vaccine which prevents getting the virus, but rather one that reduces symptoms.Last week the UK secured  million doses of a potential vaccine to make sure Brits are first in line for a jab.That deal is being developed by an alliance between BioNtech and Pfizer as well as the firm Valneva.It comes as Boris Johnson warned there are signs of a second wave sweeping Europe.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

From the start, Kate was horried at the way Meghan spoke to staff members at Kensington Palace and it was clear they would never click in the way Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson had once done.The now infamous tiara row, which I first revealed in November , was the culmination of many fallouts before the wedding.Afterwards, William and the Queen’s dresser and closest confidante, Angela Kelly, were united in their decision not to loan Meghan items from the Royal Collection, which included tiaras worn by Diana.As I began to report these stories, it is true to say Harry and Meghan became suspicious of their own staff, incorrectly believing they had been somehow hijacked by dark forces, the so-called “men in grey suits”, at Buckingham Palace.That categorisation is too simplistic.Who are these men  They may have existed in , but the senior figures in key roles behind the scenes within the Royal Family tend to be thoroughly modern members of the metropolitan elite these days.While it is correct to say they encouraged the couple to follow more conventional processes in terms of their dealings with other royal households and the Press, the real-le Sussex Squad was doggedly committed to the couple’s principles and goals.For example, their communications chief Sara Latham — blamed by Meghan for any negative stories in British newspapers — was a highly successful opera- tor who had worked for Hillary Clinton.She was prepared to pack up her le in London and move to Africa with the couple perman- ently to help achieve their humanitarian goals.Much official time and energy was put into the South African relocation planonly for the couple to eventually brand it too dficult.Instead, Harry and Meghan foolishly began to rely almost entirely on advice provided by a small team of fiercely loyal Hollywood advisers.I managed to unpick details of this secret cabal throughout the latter half of last year, but they had been causing major headaches for Buckingham Palace long before that.The group — attorney Rick Genow, business manager Andrew Meyer and talent agent Nick Collins — are typical Hollywood “Yes” people.Just as important were her PR advisers from the controversial crisis management firm Sunshine Sachs, specically Shawn Sachs and Keleigh Thomas Morgan.They had all become close with Meghan while she was a moderate star on the cable TV legal drama Suits, an era when she was so desperate for coverage in magazines she would even set up shots with paparazzi photog- raphers.She kept the Hollywood crew largely on the sidelines during the early days of her courtship with Harry. But as tensions with royal courtiers increased, so too did Meghan’s contact with them.It was this team who bunkered down with Meghan over Christmas and New Year in Canada, secretly drafting the content for the Sussex Royal website that, when published,like a Hollywood press release than a statement of intent by two senior members of the British Royal Family.Much has been written about how I broke the story of Megxit, with the finger incorrectly being pointed at both Clarence House and Kensington Palace.The couple like to promote the idea that they were somehow ambushed into revealing their plans after we published the world exclusive on January .However, they neglect to mention I had originally put the story to their office ten days earlier and had discussed every aspect of what we eventually published with their officials.It is not a coincidence my first story of the move included details of the Sussexes’ unhappiness about the release of photographs over Christmas featuring the Queen, Charles, William and George.The biography goes further by pointing to the absence of a picture of Harry, Meghan and Archie on the Queen’s table during her annual Christmas Day message.It is inconceivable to me that this wasn’t a purposeful slight by the institution, trying to make a point to Harry and Meghan: “Come back and join the party during events like Christmas or we’ll pretend you don’t exist.”It backfired spectacularly.So can such a toxic relationship be healed There is a growing acknowledgement from both sides that so long as Harry and Meghan’s romantic relationship remains strong, that is highly unlikely.But this book is a spectacular own goal by a couple who like to insist they are opposed to bitchy off-the-record briefings and royal revelations using source quotes slagging off other members of The Firm.Because fundamentally, that’s all Finding Freedom is.Unlike Andrew Morton’s game-changing Diana: Her True Story, there is no revelation that makes you think dferently about what went on.A couple desperate to blame others for their unwise decisions have allowed a fanboy “journalist” to confirm a whole load of newspaper exclusives, which they incidentally denied at the time, but spun with their own, often , narrative.Harry and Meghan are not victims of the media, the establishment or the British public.I will never forget that beautul spring day in May  when the entire country celebrated a royal wedding with the type of hope and joy not seen since July , when Charles and Diana tied the knot.It was one of those rare moments, like the London  Olympics, when we celebrated as one.This couple had the world at their feet — superstardom and influence any film actor or pop star would dream of, but without the cumbersome pressure of the throne hanging over them, like the Cambridges.They had a very real chance to help reinvent and modernise the monarchy from within.What a tragedy they have chosen to focus their energies on settling scores in tawdry tell-alls and unnecessary courtroom battles.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If you live in the affected areas, you should not visit someones home or garden regardless of whether this is in or outside of the restricted area.The mixup came as England was hit with  new positive cases – the highest number in  days – adding to fears the country is facing a second wave of the virus.But the sudden new rules - which means that people can still go to work and even visit shops and cafes - have left Brits reeling after they were introduced about .pm, barely three hours before they were put into force.What the new rules mean:About .million people will be affected by the new lockdown rules - which are expected to be subject to a weekly review.The affected areas include all of the .million residents of Greater Manchester, as well as the Lancashire towns of Blackburn, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle and Rossendale.West Yorkshire, Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees were also hit.Leicester was also included in the households ban, but pubs, restaurants and hairdressers will reopen on Monday.However, leisure centres, gyms and pools will remain closed.Earlier Mr Hancock has admitted Muslims living in the area will have their Eid celebrations affected.He said: My heart goes out to the Muslim community.

But it does mean, for everybody, meetings between households wont be possible and of course that has a particular impact when theres a celebration like Eid coming up for the Muslim community. Baroness Sayeeda Warsi today slammed the lack of clarity over the message on Good Morning Britain, saying she had received calls up to am overnight by confused members of the community.She said: “There is still not clarity on whether that means you can meet outdoors, thankfully there is still some clarication that those mosques that had prepared for Covid Eid prayers with the proper procedures would be allowed to go ahead.“People have voluntarily been part of this response and I think it would have been better to do this with a little more understanding and clarity.”Labour leader Keir Starmer said he would not argue with local action to reduce the transmission of the virus but said: Announcing measures affecting potentially millions of people late at night on Twitter is a new low for the government’s communications during this crisis.He added: For all the bluster, government has failed to deliver a ing track and trace system that would spot local flare ups like these.Lucy Powell, the MP for Manchester Central, said she had been blindsided by the new rules.And Health Secretary Matt Hancock this morning was left trying to defend the move, saying the move had been absolutely necessary.Speaking to Sky News, he said the new rules were crystal clear, saying the test and trace data had shown most of the transmission is happening between households.He added: Everyone can see that the problem with this virus is it thrives on the social contact that makes le worth living.The Health Secretary had last night said he was introducing the new measures with a heavy heart - tweeting the announcement at .pm with details published two hours later before the full guidelines were released this morning.Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said there had been a “marked change” across his boroughs in recent days.Speaking on Good Morning Britain today, he said: The truth of the matter is the pub is a more regulated environment, as is public transport where people are supposed to wear face masks.The home is a less regulated.And he defended the sudden introduction of the new guidelines, saying the virus could move quickly.Lib Dem leader Ed Davey wrote: How this lockdown in Manchester, East Lancs  West Yorks has been introduced is worrying, confusing, frustrating and damaging.No-one doubts these are dficult decisions - but when lives of millions of people are involved, Ministers have a duty to communicate professionally.Others took issue with Wigan being included in the fresh lockdown rules, saying that it had been lumped in with Greater Manchesters rise without recording an increase itself.One local tweeted: Wigan has the lowest rate of cases in Greater Manchester... its not our fault other parts of Manchester are letting the side down.Another added: Wigan has  cases per , and is on lockdown. City of London has  cases per , and no lockdown.

However, the Govts handling of this lockdown has been totally shambolic and lessons must be learnt for the future to prevent others going through the same.Mr Hancocks shock measures came as England was hit with  new positive cases - the highest number in  days - adding to fears the country is facing a second wave of the virus.Leicester MP Jonathan Ashworth tweeted: Not yet seen guidance but as I understand it #LeicesterLockdown:Pubs, restaurants  hairdressers will reopen but not gyms, Leisure centres, swimming pools.But no household mixing other than bubbles.

It comes as government scientists say there is a “low but tangible possibility” sufferers are infectious for seven to nine days. Officials expect only a relatively small number to be affected.

It needs fixing.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work.

However, in its current form it fails to provide a dependable safety net. It has led to an unprecedented number of people relying on foodbanks and not being able to pay their rent.He said some features of the system were harming women, disabled people and the vulnerable.And he added: “Universal Credit needs more money to catch up after  years of cuts to the social security budget and substantial reform to its design.“The five-week wait for a first payment must be replaced by a non-repayable two-week grant to all claimants.The Lords report also recommends that the punitive taper rate should be reduced - another aim of The Suns campaign - to encourage more people into work.And it says all claimants should have a higher work allowance to allow them to keep more of their hard-earned cash too.The Lords also conclude that including childcare support in Universal Credit was a mistake and paying in arrears is a huge barrier to work - as we have repeatedly highlighted.In some cases it has been a disincentive to work, the report says.The Government should remove childcare support from Universal Credit and be made into a new standalone benefit paid, it added.Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labours Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, said of the report: “Sadly, this report confirms what many have known for a long time – Universal Credit is simply not working. There is clear consensus that the system is not delivering on its objectives and is instead pushing people further into poverty and debt.Ministers should listen to their Conservative colleagues’ calls for a reformed social security system.The DWP said in response to the report it would consider their recommendations in detail.Minister for Welfare Delivery Will Quince said of the report: “The case for Universal Credit has never been stronger. The system defied its critics in unprecedented and unforeseeable circumstances, processing more than .m new claims at pace since mid-March and paying more than a million advances worth hundreds of millions of pounds to those in urgent need within days.“We remain committed to supporting the most vulnerable in society, which is why we currently spend over £ billion a year on the benefits system. We’ve also increased the Universal Credit standard allowance by up to £, a year, as part of a package of welfare measures worth over £. billion.“We welcome the acknowledgement by the Committee that Universal Credit is here to stay and we will consider their recommendations in detail.”IF youre experiencing trouble applying for your Universal Credit, or the payments just dont cover costs, here are your options:Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And that means theres a responsibility, a responsibility we cannot avoid or dismiss, for us to reshape this industry in a way that benefits everyone and everything for decades to come.Harry launched Travalyst last autumn, co-founding it with leading brands Booking, Skyscanner, Tripadvisor, Trip and Visa, and it now operates as an independent non-profit organisation based in the UK.Speaking on video-link, the duke went on to say: Before the pandemic unfolded we witnessed more and more young people expressing an interest in authentic travel experiences and an ability to partake in trips that are greener, that allow them to support local communities, uphold heritage and protect destinations and cultures.This is the future of travel, and a future that Travalyst is here to support and catalyse.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The government has confirmed that new rules, banning indoor meetings between households in Greater Manchester and parts of East Lancashire and West Yorkshire, will also apply to bars and restaurants.

On Thursday evening, he announced that from midnight, people from dferent households in Greater Manchester, parts of East Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire are banned from meeting each other in homes or gardens. Yet again it means families and friends will be forced to stay apartthey do not live together - and Mr Hancock appeared to point the finger of blame at the public. But it immediately caused confusion about whether this just applies to meeting in homes, or whether shops, pubs and restaurants would be forced to close. Below is everything we know so far about tonightaposs announcement. Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog here What areas are affected  The areas that these changes apply to are:Greater Manchester:City of ManchesterTrafford Stockport Oldham Bury Wigan Bolton Tameside Rochdale SalfordLancashire:Blackburn with Darwen Burnley Hyndburn Pendle RossendaleWest Yorkshire:Bradford Calderdale Kirklees The new rules People in these areas will not be permitted to mix with other householdsin private homes or gardens.Households may go to hospitality, for instance bars and pubs, but new guidance will make clear that two households should not go to hospitality together. Some exemptions will be put in place, including for the vulnerable. If you live in one of the affected areas, in order to help prevent the spread of coronavirus, the government says you should not:Meet people you do not live with inside a private home or garden, except where you have formed a support bubble . Visit someone ’s home or garden eventhey live outside of the affected areas. Socialise with people you do not live with in other indoor public venues – such as pubs, restaurants, cafes, shops, places of worship, community centres, leisure and entertainment venues, or visitor attractions. You may attend these venues with people you live with , but should avoid interaction with others. What happensyou donapost follow the rules The government will pass new laws to enforce the changes to meeting people in private homes and gardens.The police will be able to take action against those that break these rules, including asking people to disperse and issuing fixed penalty notices . It will be illegal for people who do not live together to meet in a private home or garden, except for limited exceptions to be set out in law.The government says you should not host or visit people you do not live with, unless they are in your support bubble. If you live in the affected areas, you should not visit someone’s home or garden regardless of whether this is in or outside of the restricted area. Blackburn and Luton The restrictions currently in place in Blackburn, announced last Friday, which saw indoor swimming pools, indoor fitness and dance studios, indoor gyms and sports facilities remaining closed, will continue. From Saturday, these leisure facilities will open in Luton, bringing it in line with the rest of the country. Eid celebrations Mosques and other places of worship have reopened for prayer and communal worship, but in a dferent socially distanced and Covid- Secure way.This means that while mosques can remain open, many will not able to welcome as many worshippers as before. What is happening in Leicester  While social gathering restrictions remain in place in Leicester City, the area will benefit from the lting of restrictions that took place on  July in England, and all local restrictions currently in place in the neighbouring borough of Oadby and Wigston will end. It means from Monday  August restaurants, cafes, bars and hairdressers in Leicester City can get back to business but leisure centres, gyms and pools will remain closed. In addition, cinemas and museums will open and religious ceremonies will be able to take place. Liz Kendall, MP for Leicester West, tweeted: Just been on call with Minister about LeicesterLockdown.  The great news is our pubs, cafes, bars  restaurants can re-open and people can go on holiday with their own household. But leisure centres, gyms  pools still closed, and no meeting up with other households indoors. Ms Kendall has called the Governmentaposs handling of the local lockdown utterly shambolic. How have people reacted  Not well, it seems fair to say. The Manchester Evening News reports that many have been vocal in their frustration at the lack of clarity. Reader Rick Slatter said: It’s a farce given all the multiple mixing in pubs and restaurants. I doubt many will stick to this. And Daniel Jones posted: Telling people they can’t see their family but they can go Asda, McDonaldaposs, pub, restaurant or whatever. This government needs to get a grip.  Why is it happening  Mr Hancock said immediate action was needed to keep people safe. Mr Hancock wrote on Twitter : Weaposre constantly looking at the latest data on the spread of coronavirus, and unfortunately weaposve seen an increasing rate of transmission in parts of Northern England. Weaposve been working with local leaders across the region, and today I chaired a meeting of the Local Action Gold Committee. Based on the data, we decided that in Greater Manchester, parts of West Yorkshire  East Lancashire we need to take immediate action to keep people safe. The spread is largely due to households meeting and not abiding to social distancing. So from midnight tonight, people from dferent households will not be allowed to meet each other indoors in these areas.  We take this action with a heavy heart, but we can see increasing rates of covid across Europe and are determined to do whatever is neccessary to keep people safe. He said he had consulted with local leaders including mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham. Speaking to the media, the Health Secretary said: Weaposre constantly vigilant and weaposve been looking at the data and unfortunately weaposve seen across parts of Northern England an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus.

In their  manesto the Conservatives pledged that free TV licences for the over s would be retained. But on Saturday this much-loved benefit comes to an end. The Tories are trying to pin the blame on the BBC but the responsibility lies entirely with them. They made a promise and now they are refusing to abide by their word. No wonder so many people feel betrayed. Free TV licences are not a perk. They are a leline for millions of pensioners for whom the telly is a source of companionship and a window into the outside world. The decision is especially cruel when so many older people are having to shield because of coronavirus. A government with a conscience would find the money to enable the BBC to maintain the benefit. In failing to do so this Tory administration has shown it is shameless and heartless. Utter failure Boris Johnson is kidding nobody when he claims his handling of the coronavirus outbreak has been a ‘massive success’. The figures from the Office for National Statistics tell the real story – England has the highest number of excess deaths in Europe. An estimated , residents have died in care homes after patients were discharged from hospital without being tested.

Major factors include drinking more than ten pints or two bottles of wine a week, head bangs such as those suffered in sports, and pollution from living on a busy road. The Lancet Commission on dementia prevention has been compiled by  leading global experts and identied the ways % of the devastating diagnosis could be avoided. Lead author Prof Gill Livingston, of University College London, said there are opportunities to make an impact “at each stage of a person’s le.” She said: “Our report shows it is within the power of policy-makers and iniduals to prevent and delay a signicant proportion of dementia.” Hearing loss in mid-lewas followed by leaving school earlyand smoking .Then came loneliness and depression , high blood pressure and physical inactivityand obesity and diabetes .It estimated that % of cases were linked to exposure to pollution in our twilight years and % to downing more than  units of alcohol a week in middle age.

And she was sacked when bosses found out - bringing to a sudden end a -year career with the same company.Megan Metcalfe told NottinghamshireLive that she was given her marching orders as her actions were deemed to amount to gross misconduct. Popular Birds Bakery has not been accepting cash for hygiene reasons since reopening following the coronavirus lockdown.They say it is to minimise any risk to staff and customers.  Yesterday, we reported how a -year-old customer was shocked and embarrassed when a Birds branch refused to sell her bread because she only had cash.And today Megan told of how many of the customers at the Birds store where she worked, in Radclfe-on-Trent, are elderly and donapost have a debit card. To make sure they didnapost leave empty-handed, the -year-old of Ruddington decided to ask them to put the money straight into her purse. She would then put the payment through on her card before showing them the receipt. The bakery business said it was with regret that they had to dismiss Megan because of her actions. I realise what I was doing was against company policy. But they had picked up the items and already gotten to the till ready to buy them, Megan said. Thereaposs no way I could let an elderly man or woman walk away telling them they could not buy it because they didnapost have a card. They had also already handled the stock so that would have to be binned or cleaned. Megan says she took around £ of payments in cash and put them through on her card and has kept receipts of the transactions.  She said she was suspended from work for a week with full pay on June  and appeared before a disciplinary hearing the week after before being dismissed from the company. I was just trying to do the right thing. I am really upset by it of course, she added. I worked at Birds for  years and  of them as a manager. I was told I was endangering staff membersapos lives by doing what I did. At no point did money transfer hands. It was straight into my purse and then I put the payment through on card and showed them the receipt. I should not have done it but I donapost like to let people down and a lot of these customers depend on us, coming to us every day. Lesley Bird, chief operating officer at Birds Bakery, said: “At Birds, we take the safety of our staff and customers very seriously – and have very tight procedures in place during this pandemic. A lot of our customer base are the elderly – many of them vulnerable – and it is our responsibility to keep them, and our staff, safe.

Businesses in popular resorts slammed the Government’s “draconian” move, which came just weeks after Spain was put on the UK’s list of safe countries. At Malaga airport, the gateway to the Costa del Sol for millions of Brits each year, half-empty planes landed throughout the day from airports across the UK. Many of the passengers who did make the trip said they were only doing so as they had a business or holiday home in the area. One tourist from Belfast said their flight was “barely % full” while another said theirs was “virtually empty”. Barely any Brits could be seen entering through arrivals, though there was a steady stream from nations such as France, Germany and Holland. A Spanish tour rep said: “This should be full of British right now . It’s so sad.” At the taxi rank, one of the many waiting drivers said: “Everybody is very angry with the British Government, it was a stupid decision by them, not based on facts.” Up the coast on the Costa Blanca, hotels in Benidorm began to close including the four-star Rio Park Hotel. Usually packed at this time of year, with % of its customers British package holiday tourists, it began to close its doors just six days after reopening. About four in five hotels in the town’s Rincon de Loix area are closed. Mr Hancock denied he was stoking up panic after he warned there was a “real danger” of the UK being hit by a fresh spike in cases. He said: “I think you can see a second wave starting to roll across Europe. We’ve got to do everything we can to prevent it from reaching these shores and to tackle it.” Jet said it will evacuate Brits on holiday in Spain and the Balearic and Canary Islands “up to and including August ”. Holidaymakers were told to cut short their holidays and book alternative flights. A spokeswoman said: “We apologise for any inconvenience caused.” Tonight it was announced that people ing from Luxembourg will have to quarantine for  days after a rise in cases there. It came amid speculation that other European countries including Belgium could be added to the list today. Spain’s tourism sector could take £billion hit this summer as the fresh restrictions take another chunk out of balance sheets already battered after months of lockdown. Bosses are hoping an upcoming review of the quarantine order could lt the restriction within days. Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto said: “They have given us a period of  days for the review.” She insisted resorts popular with Brits are “at low risk” of coronavirus and even “better” than the UK. Spain is still fighting for destinations such as the Canary and Balearic Islands to be excluded from the quarantine rule. Ms Maroto said: “There has been talk of a second wave of the pandemic but we’re not at all at that point. “The new outbreaks are under control and are in very specic places, and Spanish tourist destinations at the moment have very low levels of contagion. “That means people can enjoy their holidays there. The virus needs to be respected but that doesn’t mean we can’t have well-deserved holidays.” Spain announced , new cases on Wednesday, the highest -hour figure since May  when the entire country was still on full lockdown.

The -year-old, from Rochdale, is now dealing with people in Leicester who’ve tested positive for Covid-. A number of changes have been rolled out to the job in recent weeks - including a new measure to track down people who donapost answer calls from the team. Where contact tracers would have previously had four days to try and reach people, that’s been reduced in the outbreak groups.  Atexplains: “If after  hours we can’t make contact with them, we escalate it and a team will go to the household and conduct an interview instead of after  hours. That’s key,” he says. The new methods mean Ataposs vital job now involves so much more than just contact tracing. He went on: “When we call anyone from Leicester, we discuss with them in more detail support we can offer – such as help with food shopping and picking up prescription medication. ‘‘It’s hoped having people to do their essential shopping and pick up prescriptions will increase levels of compliance and make self-isolation easier.” Sarah Hartle , a dental hygienist from Manchester, is another NHS Test and Trace caseworker who has seen her job change to help fight coronavirus.  As pubs, restaurants and shops opened up, she and the team faced new challenges when tracing contacts, so they were given extra training to get the right information from people who’d tested positive for coronavirus. “What’s changed is the questions we’re asking the patients,” she says. “If they were in a shop, were they wearing a mask  Was the shopkeeper  Did they pay by cash or card  Were they maintaining social distancing  If you are doing all those things, the people in that particular shop are not classed as contacts. It’s all based on science. Social distancing does work.” And with the NHS Test and Trace team regularly updated on the latest advice and improvements in the system put in place, they’re able to give people the relevant help they need. She adds: “One recent patient needed a Hindi speaker. The system for that is now so simple and quick, the patient is only on hold for about  seconds and then youaposrere back with the interpreter.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dr miriam stoppard ethnic minorities","story":"NewsopinionDr Miriam Stoppard: Ethnic minorities being failed by lack of inclusive planningThe pandemic has starkly revealed that BAME people are less likely to use Covid- testing services – we need to look at issues from their point of view to find solutionsShareCommentsByMiriam Stoppard:,  JUL NewsopinionTesting kit instructions can be hard to understand for people whose first language is not English \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

It’s not just in the UK that ­disparities exist – it’s worldwide. Action is needed to correct this so people from ethnic minorities are included in national and local health planning. Catherine Dodds of Bristol ­University and Ibidun Fakoya from King’s College, London suggest the way forward in an editorial in the BMJ. To keep the R number below one, governments are relying on ­nationwide testing and contact tracing until we have a vaccination programme in place. But while we wait, inequalities mean BAME Covid- infections and deaths keep rising.As Dodds and Fakoya point out we already know uptake of medical testing and screening is uneven across cancer risk assessment, antenatal screening, and HIV testing. The NHS is aiming to expand testing with self-administered swab kits – but this strategy may serve minority groups badly, bearing in mind a  UK study found uptake of HIV self-sampling kits among them was low compared with other groups. Most admitted they would probably not use the kits. Behind this reluctance were privacy issues and kits with complicated instructions that were inappropriately worded for people whose first language wasn’t English. Dodds and Fakoya emphasise until these faults are corrected it’s dficult to see how trust can be built up among our ethnic communities. Isn’t it time we looked at these ­disparities from the BAME point of view, and started framing instructions in a form that’s understandable, acceptable and useful for ethnic minorities instead of imposing a “one-size-fits-all” approach  Given the disproportionate and devastating impact this pandemic has already had among our ethnic minority communities, testing equality needs to be addressed in Covid- screening.

Dozens of people have questioned what the move means for visits to pubs and gyms, reports Manchester Evening News. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has urged people not to be aposselfishapos and stick to the rules. Thousands of Manchester Evening News  readers have had their say on Facebook and Twitter. Ian Robinson said: Everybody shouldnapost be tarred with the same brush - there are towns in Greater Manchester that have done as told and have low infection rates. Rebecca Mosbach posted: Not surprised. This is what happens when people canapost obey the rules. Waltzing around shopping centres without masks. No regard for others. Reader Rick Slatter said: It’s a farce given all the multiple mixing in pubs and restaurants. I doubt many will stick to this. While Daniel Jones posted: Telling people they can’t see their family but they can go Asda, McDonaldaposs, pub, restaurant or whatever. This government needs to get a grip. Julie Barnettaposs question was blunt. Why wonapost people get a grip and do the right thing , she said.

In fact, people across Britain have been shown to know less about the measures in place now than they did at the start of lockdown in March, say researchers from University College London. The Covid- Social Study - involving , participants - was launched with funding from the Nuffield Foundation, and support from Wellcome, UK Research and Innovationfrom the week beginning March . Forty-five per cent of those living in England have a strong grasp of the rules, just half of the amount who understood things four months ago. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE   Scotland and Wales faired a little better in the data - with a more respectable  and  percent. And those who understand every last detail are a particularly rare breed - just  percent in England,  in Wales and  in Scotland. Lead author, Dr Daisy Fancourtsaid: “Our study shows that as lockdown measures have eased at dferent rates in each nation of the UK, levels of understanding around what is and isn’t permissible have dropped, especially amongst younger adults.  “This could possibly reflect dficulties in applying the rules to more complex le scenarios amongst younger adults, or may be reflective of the dferent amounts of time spent following the news on Covid- amongst dferent age groups.“The general drop-off in understanding could be due to unclear messaging from the government, or a reduction in interest and engagement from people, especially with the cessation of the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing in late June.”The study also found access to healthcare has fallen during the lockdown, with  in  people across the UK reporting being unable to see or speak with a GP about their physical health. While, one in  have been unable to speak to a professional about their mental health, and  in  not telling a GP about symptoms of an illness when they usually would have done . Groups who faced the most barriers included younger adults, women, iniduals from BAME backgrounds, and people with physical and mental health conditions.

She might as well have said “let them eat chips”. It’s not just the fact that cooking potatoes from scratch takes more gas, adding oil costs money, it takes longer for an exhausted parent with three jobs to provide and a kilo of potatoes is harder to get home from the supermarket on foot – it’s the fact that we’ve been here so many times before. And the tired old implication is always the same. If only poor people could cook better, or buy in bulk, or just be better human beings. This week I spoke to Shareen Kellett, a mum on a very low income. A former estate agent, she’s shielding because she has the auto-immune disease lupus, making it hard to shop. Luckily, her six-year-old twins’ inspirational school, Grove House Primary, in Bradford, has kept the family fed throughout the pandemic, delivering nutritionally balanced food parcels supplied by the community interest company Rethink Food. “I have never, ever seen such amazing food,” Shareen, , says. “It’s unbelievable. Giant fruit, massive vegetables, the most amazing pasta.” It isn’t that Shareen doesn’t know what to do with a bag of potatoes. It’s that she didn’t have any potatoes. “I’ve been making big roasts. We’ve been having strawberries and feta cheese in our salads. I’ve always cooked from scratch but having these ingredients has been amazing.” And here’s the irony. “When I asked the school where it was coming from so I could shop there in the future, they said it’s all been erted from waste,” Shereen says. “It was actually going to be thrown away! What has gone wrong with the world  “We now have a fruit bowl full of fruit and the kids eat it all day long.”This week the Government unveiled two food strategies – the PM’s obesity plan and a wider food strategy by Henry Dimbleby, the Leon founder and UK ‘Food Czar’. Refreshingly, the Dimbleby report makes clear the toxic connection between hunger, poverty, inequality and our broken food chain. Rethink Food was set up by a former headteacher, who left teaching to launch the organisation with fellow teacher Kevin Mackay. “One Monday after a half-term, the gas failed in the kitchens and we had to feed the children sandwiches,” Nathan Atkinson says. “There was a major incident that afternoon that I later realised had been caused by hunger. When I spoke to the children involved, one of them said to me, ‘It hurts here,’ pointing to his stomach. He said, ‘You usually give us a roast dinner when we come back’.” "},{"url":null,"title":"harry felt like third wheel","story":"NewsHarry felt like a third wheel and a gooseberry when out with William and KateBefore the Duke of Sussex, , married American actress Meghan Markle, , he would often carry out official engagements with his brother Prince William and sister-in law Kate MiddletonShareCommentsByLorraine King:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video prince-harry-makes-first-appearance-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news harry-felt-like-third-wheel-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Discussing the bombshell biography of Harry and Meghan, Royal expert Katie Nicholl highlighted Harry feeling like a third wheel and playing a gooseberry to his brother and sister-in-law. Before Harry, , married -year-old Meghan in May  he would often attend events with his brother and sister-in-law.Katie spoke to ET Canada about extracts from Finding Freedom by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand saying while the media loved the suggestion that Prince Harry, Prince William and Kate Middleton were fanastic team, Harry felt like aposa spare wheelapos.She added: At points [in time], I even heard him complaining that he felt like the gooseberry, the third one along at the date. He never quite fitted in. Katie, who is the author of William And Harry: Behind The Palace Wall, added that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge went out of their way to make sure Harry felt apospart of the teamapos but he aposalways wanted to be his own personapos. She said: I think Meghan has very much been the catalyst in giving him that confidence to break free from William and Kate, and to break free from that trio dynamic, which was at times cozy and convenient, but actually wasnapost really what he wanted. Katie added that Meghan very much a driving force and wasnapost being credited by people for giving Harry confidence. The Duke of Sussex is currently living in Los Angeles with Meghan and their one-year-old son Archie since they quit he royal family.  The book also claims to reveal details of the fallout between Meghan and Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, suggesting the Queen didnapost approve of their decision to quit and says Prince Charles gave them a aposwarningapos. It also gives details of their first date and suggests the couple actually got engaged two months before they said they did.

Earlier, the Health Secretary confirmed parts of Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and East Lancashire will be included in the new rules, which mean households cannot meet each other indoors from midnight tonight.At .pm he tweeted: Weaposre constantly looking at the latest data on the spread of coronavirus, and unfortunately weaposve seen an increasing rate of transmission in parts of Northern England.Weaposve been working with local leaders across the region, and today I chaired a meeting of the Local Action Gold Committee. Based on the data, we decided that in Greater Manchester, parts of West Yorkshire  East Lancashire we need to take immediate action to keep people safe. The spread is largely due to households meeting and not abiding to social distancing. So from midnight tonight, people from dferent households will not be allowed to meet each other indoors in these areas. We take this action with a heavy heart, but we can see increasing rates of covid across Europe and are determined to do whatever is neccessary to keep people safe. Speaking to the media, Mr Hancock added: Weaposre constantly vigilant and weaposve been looking at the data and unfortunately weaposve seen across parts of Northern England an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus. So today I held a meeting of the Governmentaposs Gold Committee and working with local leaders including for instance Andy Burnham the mayor of Greater Manchester, weaposve decided that we need to action across Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire. So from midnight tonightwe are banning households meeting up indoors. It is understood that under the restrictions, people can still go to pubs and restaurants as long as they only go with members of their own household. Gardens are also understood to be off-limits - but you can meet other households in parks and outdoor spaces. The new restrictions apply to Greater Manchester, as well as a number of places in East Lancashire - Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle and Rossendale.  In West Yorkshire, Bradford, Kirklees and Calderdale are affected. Leicester is also affected, which has been under a local lockdown since June . Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, said there had been a marked change in the picture in recent days regarding the spread of coronavirus.

She says the grim infestation has turned her neighbourhood into an attraction - with people descending hoping to catch a glimpse of the large rodents. Footage from her home in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, shows at least five big rats looking for food through a mountain of rubbish in a wheelie bin. They scurry through the bags and some of them are seen crawling away through the brick wall.The -year-old, who doesnapost wish to be named, told Yorkshire Live : Itaposs horrible I canapost let my children out to play in the garden as itaposs just not safe.My son got a new see-saw for his birthday but Iaposve had to put it inside as he canapost play on it in the garden in case the rats climb all over it. I also canapost use my car now as one of the rats chewed through the diesel pipe so now I canapost move it. Itaposs just embarrassing. I feel ashamed of where I live because of it and I canapost have a normal le. She said she has tried raising the issues to Barnsley Council and they sent pest control teams to fill in the holes but she said the rats keep on coming back.  Nothing is being done to get rid of them, whatever the council is doing it clearly isnapost working, the mum added. Itaposs not good enough there are family homes along this street and its just not safe. Barnsley councillor Chris Lamb said: When we visited Havelock street on April , , several issues were found to be the cause of the rats.  We have visited the site on many occasions, often on a daily basis, since the complaint was made. In this time we have worked with residents and businesses to try to recty any problems which could lead to a rat infestation, such as clearing blocked drains, replacing cracked domestic bins and removing any build-up of waste in close proximity to properties on the street.

The lockdowns came into force at midnight - coinciding with an important holy date on British Muslimsapos religious calendar. Has your Eid been affected by the new lockdown measures  If so get in touch: webnews@trinitymirror Eid al-Adha, aposThe Feast of Sacrice,apos begins today and traditionally is a time for families to gather and celebrate together. Familiesapos preparations for meals together will be in tatters in affected northern areas, as gatherings are restricted to households once again. Mosques in the north which had been painstakingly planning socially-distant Eid prayers have however received clarity they can go ahead. The decision sparked widespread fury in the affected counties, as the new restrictions were announced suddenly last night - leaving many Brits with unanswered questions about the new rules. Visiting people at home or even in gardens is now banned in vast swathes of northern England.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock stoked further confusion this morning when he told the BBC people could still visit pubs and restaurants in the lockdown areas - but only with their own household. But as Adil explained on GMB: You have to remember for the the Muslim community, theyaposre not gonna go to pubs itaposs not really their thing, so the idea of having it at home is the core element. Baroness Sayeeda Warsi told GMB the lockdown rules that kick in today remain unclear to many people in affected areas. She said: Itaposs till unclear had phone calls this morning right through to am, into the early hours of the morning saying aposwell what does that mean apos  Because thereaposs still not clarity on whether you can meet outdoors, thankfully there was some clarication that those mosques that had already prepared for Covid Eid prayers with the proper procedures in place would be allowed to go ahead. But i think the lack of clarity and the lateness of the message hasnapost encouraged what effectively throughout the pandemic has been a community-wide response across the UK. Mr Hancock this morning denied that the action taken was being aimed at curtailing Eid celebrations. Asked on BBC’s Today programme whether the measures were announced late on Thursday night to stop Eid celebrations from taking place, he said: “No, my heart goes out to the Muslim communities in these areas because I know how important the Eid celebrations are. “I’m very grateful to the local Muslim leaders, the imams in fact, across the country who’ve been working so hard to find a way to have Covid-secure celebrations. “For instance celebrating Eid in parks where there’s more space available and of course outdoors is safer than indoors.” The new lockdowns broaden the restrictions imposed due to an outbreak in Oldham, in Greater Manchester, earlier this week. Oldham Council said there had been a spike in cases in younger people in their twenties and thirties, with many cases arising in Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities.  Household spread had been a aposreal issueapos, the council said, with multiple iniduals from the same household testing positive. Oldham Mosque Council considered whether it was safe to hold Eid prayers, but decided to go ahead with extra measures in place after consulting all the mosques in the town. Oldham resident Asghar Mahmoods told the Manchester Evening News before the new lockdowns were revealed: Itaposs not great news for the Asian community in general, not being able to interact with families and loved ones. Itaposs one of those things - people need to be a bit more educated. Itaposs definitely impacted on our plans. But you make a bad situation into a good one. We can use technology to speak to our families. Itaposs not all doom and gloom.the weather is good we can sit in gardens. What is Eid al-Adha  The second Eid of the year, Eid al-Adha begins today and comes after Muslims made the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. Hajj usually sees millions of Muslims visiting the holy mosque but Mecca heavily restricted the traditional annual pilgrimage this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Liz Kendall, Labour MP for Leicester West, said that despite an unbelievably dficult period for the city, the hard work and sacrice of residents had paid off. She added that leisure centres, gyms and public swimming pools will remain closed and multiple households will not be permitted to meet indoors, but did not say when the changes to the rules would come into effect. Stricter lockdown restrictions were put in place in Leicester and other nearby areas by Health Secretary Matt Hancock on June  after a spike in Covid- infections.

But leisure centres, gyms  pools still closed, and no meeting up with other households indoors.  This has been an unbelievably dficult period for our city but peoples hard work  sacrices have paid off. She added that the Government handling of the lockdown had been totally shambolic and that lessons needed to be learnt to prevent similar situations in future. Responding to questions from local residents, she added: To everyone asking questions, Iaposm really sorry I donapost have any more details, this is just what we were told on the call.  But I wanted to let people know as soon as possible whataposs happening as it is quite frankly a disgrace weaposve been left waiting so long without any proper info.

But parts of the south could be hampered with thundery showers in the afternoon - a reminder that July has been particularly wet throughout. Popular tourist spots on the continent including Ibiza, Lisbon and Berlin fall short of the UK high, reaching C, C and C respectively.  In the UK the hot weather will be widespread across south eastern areas in Kent and Cambridgeshire, where temperatures will stay around -C.Manchester is expected to peak at C and parts of Wales will also reach C. A spokesman for the Met added that popular south-coast destinations such as Devon and Cornwall will stay fresher, with temperatures peaking in the mid s, and sunseekers in Brighton will enjoy a pleasant C high. But the good weather is expected to be short-lived and will not extend into the three-day heatwave territory.  Northern Ireland will be caught by a slow moving weather front on Friday, keeping temperatures at a balmy C, that will go on to cool the rest of the UK on Saturday. The front will result in temperature drops of up to C overnight with highs of C and C in London and Manchester respectively, on Saturday. The UK average temperature for this July is currently on course to be just .C, one degree less than the - long-term average of .C, data from the Met shows. So far this month, the highest maximum temperature recorded was .C on July  at Heathrow Airport.  The UK has already surpassed % of the average monthly rainfall and only experienced two thirdsof the expected sunshine for an average July, a total of . hours, Met Office figures show. Weaposve not seen a temperature anywhere above  so far or even with a three in it, that is quite unusual for July, a Met spokesman said. In terms of shting the overall weather stats for the month, itaposs not going to do much to the average. August, meanwhile, looks to be starting very a similarly unsettled manner. The Met Officeaposs long range report says: There are some fairly strong signals that unsettled conditions are likely to continue through into the first half of August, with outbreaks of rain and scattered showers affecting all parts of the United Kingdom at times.

There have been claims of ghost sightings and spooky goings-on at Loftus Hall in Fethard on Sea, County Wexford, after the property became the setting for a terrying mythical incident told to have taken place about  years ago.The imposing home, priced at £.m, features impressive Georgian architecture, stunning landscaped grounds and  bedrooms, as reported by the Irish Mirror.The manor became a tourist attraction in , being used for ghost hunts and tours, and it has also has also provided the backdrop for horror films and paranormal invesigations.Itaposs being sold by owners Aidan and Shane Quigley, but potential buyers have been warned of a spooky history that dates back to  when it was known as Redmond Hall. The legend goes one night a mysterious guest called at the home, then occupied by Lord and Lady Tottenham, and their daughter Lady Anne. As a storm raged outside, the family invited the man inside to shelter and the story claims as they played a game to pass the time, Lady Anne bent down to retrieve a fallen playing card from under the table to discover their guest had the aposcloven hooves of the devilapos.  The daughter let out a blood-curdling scream and the satanic visitor is said to have disappeared through the ceiling in a puff of flames and smoke. Lady Anne apparently aposwent into a state of shock and madnessapos before she was forcefully locked away in a tapestry room, dying not long afterwards. Following her death, the family and the servants in the manor claimed to have seen her spirit roaming the halls.  There is always a feeling that you are not alone in Loftus Hall, said Aidan. The once grand interior has now faded but among the peeling wallpaper and decaying ing, there are glimpses of its past splendour with parquet floors, ornate fireplaces and rolling views from its  windows. The site date backs to  when a Norman knight, Raymond le Gros, built a castle on the grounds, before it was replaced by a hall after the black death.

Horried onlookers recorded the moment the thrill-seeking tourist hurled himself into the water at a beauty spot called Cap Negret near the party resort of San Antonio. A loud thud can be heard in the footage - thought to be the sound of the Brit hitting rocks under the water. The man was admitted to intensive care with injuries said to have included broken bones and a spinal problem. One of the astonished Spaniards who filmed the scene could be overheard telling a pal: “They’re f*****g mad” as they watched the Brit overlooking the water beside a friend while he prepared to jump. The injured man, who is  years old and in Ibiza’s Can Misses Hospital, has not been named. Hospital chiefs have yet to confirm overnight reports he has now been moved from intensive care to a trauma unit. The alarm was raised at roughly pm on Wednesday. Firefighters led the rescue, although local police, Civil Guard and paramedics were also mobilised by a regional government-run emergency response coordination centre.Cap Negret is well-known in Ibiza as one of the best places in Ibiza to see the sun go down. In August  a British holidaymaker died in Ibiza after leaping off a clf and hitting rocks in a freak accident while celebrating his th birthday. Paul Gardner, from North Shields, ed into the sea at a cove near San Antonio called Cala Gracio. He was said at the time to have hit rocks as he leapt from a height of around  feet in a misjudged attempt to reach deep water.  Local police, Civil Guard and an ambulance were sent to the scene but the Brit had gone into cardiac arrest and efforts to revive him failed. Paul had only flown out to Ibiza from Newcastle Airport with pals two days before the tragedy. They stayed at the four-star Hotel Orosol in San Antonio.

Citizens who live in or travel to regions of the Asian country bordering China are being forced to sign a pledge confirming they will never defect, according to reports. The dictator is now requiring anyone in the hermit kingdom traveling to border areas to submit a document with their finger print and a confirmation they will not permanently leave. The extra red tape - which came into place earlier this month - is causing major disruption to business, wedding and funeral travel in a country where the  million residents already need special domestic travel permits. One person who lives in the North Hamgyong province told Radio Free Asiaaposs Korean Service prior to the new regulations, citizens had to verbally declare they had no plans to defect - while showing a certicate of citizenship as well as character references. Stamping another fingerprint to get a travel certicate is not that dficult, but it is unpleasant that so many confirmation documents have been added, and people going to the border areas feel frustrated that they are being treated as potential escapees, they said. The restrictions are part of a government campaign to discredit exiles after anti government propaganda leaflets were floated across the border from South Korea.  According to reports, some citizens are missing important family events because they did not prepare the necessary documents in advance. One source is reported as saying those who live near border areas are always treated as potential escapees. One resident of the Ryanggang province on the Chinese border told RFA they have to pass through checkpoints with ID cards, as well as up to five certicates and the written pledge. Meanwhile, relatives of those who flee the country while traveling to the border region are subject to punishments including internal exile.

However, it’s also a chance to lay down a marker.Grab a positive result there and the Dark Blues head into two home games on the bounce with Morton and newly-promoted Raith Rovers coming to town before the end of October – an opportunity to get off to a flying start.On the back of a trip to face Ayr, Dundee play Dick Campbell’s Arbroath at Dens before a Highlands clash with Inverness and then facing a Dunfermline side that has strengthened well over the past few weeks.After a Boxing Day trip to Dumfries, it’s the only midweek fixture of the campaign – home to Alloa – four days before hosting Hearts in what’s likely to be one of the biggest matches of the calendar for the Dens men.With only  of the  matches before the turn of the year, getting  off to a strong start will be essential to any promotion bid.That’s where the fixture list looks to be in Dundee’s favour – successive home games against the Jambos, Ayr and Inverness with trips to Raith and Arbroath in between.That run from the start of the year through to March’sto Tynecastle will be the key to success for James McPake and his men before heading into the final eight matches.The Dark Blues won’t be too happy with the card they’ve been dealt by the SPFL but defiance in the face of adversity is a trait at Dens Park.And come the final day on a Friday night at Queen of the South, the players will still fancy they can finish up on top and get the club back to the big time – eventhey have to do it the hard way.A full fixture list can be found here.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I was lucky enough to play under Ivanin  but I’d lost three before we’d managed to get one.“Jim was manager for a few before then as well so that was probably big thing for him, not being able to do the clean sweep of Scottish football.“Aberdeen were the benchmark, with the New Firm at the time, the two of us were competing against one another.“Them having won European titles probably was sore for him, especially having gone so close.“You look at Roma and then Gothenburg it was, obviously, a big thing for him.”Bowman, who would go on to make  appearances for the club, checked in at Tannadice in  and was part of United’s efforts to make the Uefa Cup showpiece that season.They, arguably, could go down in history as the club’s greatest-ever side.However, the former Hearts man was quick to hail McLean’s title-winning side of  as the best of all.“I would still say when they won the league in  was their best team, what an achievement that was for the club,” he added.“But he kept on evolving the team by bringing myself, Jim McInally and Iain Ferguson to the club in .“When I look back at my time, the players I played with were absolutely brilliant.“They were top professionals as well with the way they conducted themselves off the park. That’s probably why they got so much success.“The likes of Heggie , Davey , Eamonn , Luggy , Holtyand Maurice , they were all great.“For Jimmy Mac, Fergie and I to come into that, playing with them week-in, week-out, it certainly makes your football a lot easier to do.”Bowman looks back on their European adventures with great fondness, hailing the Arabs as some of the best supporters on the continent.“When you look back at the  Uefa Cup run and we were playing Lens in the first round, there wasn’t loads of press and fans but the hype grew as we went on,” he continued.“As we went through the rounds you could see it building.“The fans were brilliant. They’d travel everywhere – the crowds for Barcelona, Monchengladbach and Gothenburg in the final were exceptional.“People even came to Romania to see us play Craiova, it was an Iron Curtain country at the time so that was dficult for their visas and getting there.“It just shows you exactly what United fans were and are still about.”LEE WILKIE: Coronavirus effect for Dundee United may be survival this season, then kick on in the next campaign\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: Coronavirus effect for Dundee United may be survival this season, then kick on in the next campaign# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-dundee-united-fc-micky-mellon embed # secretKqynNAaff\" data-secret\"KqynNAaff\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I was only there for two years but we have stayed in touch ever since.“The more that I worked with him, you could see he thinks about the game a lot.“Sometimes when you play, you do your own thing and go home. You don’t really think about the game.“But I think he studied it a wee bit more and I saw that the longer I was with him,# added the Tannadice number two.“His accent is still broader than mine and he has been down there for years.“Seriously, coming here is a great opportunity for me and I am delighted he gave me the call.“I actually spoke to Micky a lot and I met him just before lockdown, paying him a visit at Tranmere.“I knew his ideas and thoughts on the game and I was up here last week speaking to him as well.“I am getting to know what he wants. At times our ideas might dfer but his are the ideas that matter so it is up to me along with the rest of the guys to get that message onto the players as best we can.”LEE WILKIE: Coronavirus effect for Dundee United may be survival this season, then kick on in the next campaign\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: Coronavirus effect for Dundee United may be survival this season, then kick on in the next campaign# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-dundee-united-fc-micky-mellon embed # secretzkvLKPr\" data-secret\"zkvLKPr\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Bringing back business safely remains a key priority.“It is therefore great to see KLM adding additional services to Aberdeen International Airport allowing our passengers access to a key hub and the connectivity that this brings for the North East of Scotland.“This further complements the other services that are available from all of our airline partners.”Benedicte Duval, general manager for Air France KLM in the UK  Ireland added: “Our decision to increase the frequency on our Aberdeen to Amsterdam service to four flights per day by the end of August is a positive sign of recovery, after what has been and still is a challenging time for our industry. KLM continued to operate a skeleton service to and from Aberdeen throughout the corona crisis, assisting the local community with essential travel and repatriation. As travel restrictions in Scotland begin to ease, we are increasing capacity in line with consumer demand.#Naturally, safety is our number one priority as travel gradually resumes and we have introduced a range of measures to ensure passengers can travel with confidence. As we all adapt to this new environment, I can assure you that our staff are fully committed to guaranteeing our passengers the highest levels of health  safety.#Face masks are mandatory both on flights, and while within the airport.Staff across the Dyce facility have also been provided with PPE and protective screens have been installed in key areas.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July .

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society. Now that it is realised how our inidual decision making makes a dference, whatever our age, we have no need to feel helpless.It is time to ask for the information and support we need."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures july 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSimon Macdonald from Kilmichael Glassary submitted this week#s featured image.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy. Teaching children the beauty of the outdoors and how to care for it can bring a lelong love for natureyou love something you usually wish to protect it.And learning never stops for any of us. Sometimes it is the basics that are needed before we move on to the complexities of natural navigation or learning our stars.So for this month here is one tip : learn how to go to the toilet in the outdoors!Doing this responsibly and teaching your children makes for a lelong enjoyment of walking and exploring without the bane of wondering where the next toilet is.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Instead, they were directed at some national policies and how they impacted on rural development.Argyll and Bute Council had been #more than helpful# to local businesses in the recovery from lockdown, the company added.Mr MacLeod also suggested Scottish Water should be encouraged to allow small developments to be served by inidual septic tanks or bio-discs.In addition, the provision of water and electricity to remote rural locations should be subsidised by the Scottish Government, he added, which would help make projects more affordable.Furthermore, the cost of #impact studies# should not fall on the developer, he said.Another issue was the requirement of registered social landlords that housing is built to extremely high specications, he said.Mr MacLeod said: #That high standard does, of course, ensure the houses are well insulated and easily maintained. The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a welcome awaits at kilmartin church","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsServices are scheduled to re-start at Glassary, Kilmartin and Ford Parish Church early next month.Trustees hope to open the modern and welcoming church building at Barr Mhor, Kilmartin, for worship from Sunday August , starting at am.Social distancing will allow for up to  people to attend and everyone is expected to wear a face covering.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place.

The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans.

There are a lot of young people for whom the real world is more amazing than anything you could make up.\"Again, thats another thing were born with that gets beaten out of us, and we start using the word ordinary ndash and theres nothing ordinary.\"Were surrounded by magic. You think Harry Potters magic  Just look around you.\"That curiosity is our biggest asset because thats how we learn to adapt, thats how we learn to survive, thats how we learn to cope with the world around us as it changes.\"Lloyd, who previously worked as a Sunday Timesjournalist, was inspired to begin a career as a childrens author after seeing the joy his children experienced when they learnt new things during their years in home-schooling.Particularly that of one of his daughters who was astonished to learn all about Antarctica ndash home of her then favourite animal, the penguin.\"I believe fundamentally, especially now having done thousands of talks in schools and festivals over the last  years, that humans generally reach peak curiosity at the age of nine or ,\" Lloyd said.\"Then things start to get in the way, like puberty and your friendship groups change and going from primary to secondary school.\"But at the age of nine or  youve got that purity of curiosity where youre old enough to know that you have an identity and youre curious enough to want to know where you fit in.\"Theres nothing you cant talk to a nine or -year-old about ndash provided you dont patronise them, provided you dont have an expectation of them that they cant meet.\"If you can meet them as fellow kindred spirits on this rock travelling around the sun, in this incredible galaxy,

In this monthly column, she shares her wildle diary ndash and pictures!DURING lockdown, I was trying to make the most of my free time ndash going on daily walks, working on my website, editing photos from before lockdown, designing my first book and completing A LOT of jigsaws .After the lockdown restrictions started to ease, I was able to spend even more time outdoors than I would normally do. I dedicated June to visiting dferent local sites to watch the kingfisher ndash which you may remember from my previous article ndash a family of wrens and the brown hares.One evening, as I was uploading my photographs on to social media and searching through the pages, I came across a few images of a bird that every birder wanted to see since its influx to the UK was published. It was a rosy starling!The beautul rosy starlinglooks nothing like the starlings we know. It strongly resembles a magpiewith a much shorter tail.This species is unmistakable in its adult plumage. The male has a pale pink body with a black head, wings, and tail. Additionally, during the breeding season the male develops a wispy crest and the black colour becomes glossier with a purplish green or blue sheen.The female is less vibrant than the male. Both sexes appear much duller outside of their breeding season.Furthermore, the rosy starling does not mimic other species, unlike its well-known cousin.What the two species have in common is murmuration ndash an astonishing and mesmerising aerial spectacle large flocks of these birds gather and perform a real show as they swoop, e and swirl across the sky in beautul shape-shting clouds. It is a phenomenon that pleases the eye of every observer.The rosy starlingrsquos breeding area stretches from the Balkans and Turkey to Central Asia and north-west China. It spends winters in India and south-east Arabia. As a strongly migratory species, it can travel outside of its normal breeding range. As a result, there are signicant periodic summer and autumn influxes in western Europe. The causes of such irruptions are not yet fully understood however, it appears to be related to changes in the population of locusts on which the birds feed.Imagine my amazement when I read that one of those birds had landed and made its temporary home in someonersquos garden in Port Seton!The cherry on the cake was that the night when I saw the first images of the rosy starling in East Lothian, I also received an email from Stuart Payne ndash the lucky host of the rosy starling. Stuart invited me to his garden.The next morning, my fianceacute Chris and I rushed to Port Seton. As we were walking towards Stuartrsquos house, we saw another birder looking around hoping to spot the rosy starling. As soon as we arrived at Stuartrsquos house, I saw this magnicent pink bird flying past the house and landing on the bird feeder to start its feast.Stuart and his we Gillian welcomed us in their garden, where I spent half an hour photographing the gorgeous rosy starling and chatting to Stuart and Gillian. I also took some time to admire their beautul dogs Hugo and Hobbes. These dogs were just wonderful, not every day you see dogs as well behaved as these two!My first and, I hope, not last experience with the rosy starling was unforgettable!

initiative to provide additional space for physical distancing to protect public health, work has started on a temporary cycle route between Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton which will run parallel to the main B Edinburgh Road.The three-metre wide path will be created by laying hard surfacing down on the grass verge on the north side of the carriageway between the two communities.The path will run alongside the footpath between the boatyard access at Prestonpans to just past the old power station with a white line separating the cyclepath and walkway.This is the councilrsquos latest project to improvesocial distancing in the wake of the Covid- crisis.The local authority received pound.million from the Scottish Governmentrsquos Spaces for People fund to introduce ious countywide measures to make it easier to social distance in town centres and improve cycle and pedestrian paths.As well as the roadside cycle route, the speed limit on Edinburgh Road, which is normally mph, will be reduced to mph and speed limits in the twocommunities reduced to just mph.The plan for the cycle path has seen dozens of painted stones created by local schoolchildren, which line the footpath, move across to the other side of the road.The stones are a symbol of hope and unity during the Covid- crisis, and many similar displays have been created throughout East Lothian and the whole country.Councillor Norman Hampshire, environment spokesperson at East Lothian Council, said: ldquoWe received many comments in the public consultation around Spaces for People on the need to provide suitable space for people cycling.ldquoMany people are currently cycling this route and we need to cater for the current increase in cyclists during the pandemic period.ldquoIn common with other Spaces for People measures, this route is for temporary use as we gradually move out of restrictions and will also provide a viable alternative to the use of the private car and or public transport for shorter-distanced essential or leisure trips in the area.The works also include the introduction of temporary crossings of Edinburgh Road at either end of the route through the use of lsquobuildoutsrsquo and bolt-down bollards.In addition, the proposals also include traffic calming measures on Edinburgh Road to slow down traffic with a temporary reduction in the speed limit to mph between the two communities, in tandem with the introduction of mph limits within the communities themselves.MrHampshire added: ldquoWe were aware of a collection of painted stones that have been carefully laid by local schoolchildren alongside the existing footway along Edinburgh Road and recognise that these are important to the local community.ldquoThe community council arranged for these to be carefully collected prior to the start of the works and they have been relocated on the other side of the road."},{"url":null,"title":"column-job-figures-worrying","story":"Furloughing has

Credit: Jevelin Getty ImagesAnything that rubs against your face for hours on end is bound to cause some irritationmdashand face masks are no dferent. lsquoWhen it comes to cloth or surgical masks, we are primarily seeing mild skin irritation, mild comedones , and reactions to the fabric itselfrsquo, Allie McAllister, BSN, FNP-C, DCNP, explains. lsquoWhile just wearing a mask can cause friction which can be irritating to the skin, the types of materials, dyes, and detergents in the mask can also cause irritation and rashesrsquo.Besides rashes and chafing, face masks can also lead to breakouts. It makes sense when you think about itmdashyour mask is creating a moist, warm environment against your skin, which is perfect for bacteria to thrive. lsquoBreakouts can occur from sweat, dirt, and moisture being trapped under the maskrsquo, McAllister says.How to protect your skin from your face maskAlways start with a clean face. Credit: Getty ImagesFor starters, McAllister says you should always thoroughly wash your face before you put on your mask and after you take it off Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser in particular because its gentle and non-irritating. Then, McAllister recommends, lsquoIf you know yoursquoll be wearing your mask for a long period of time I would suggest applying a thin layer of Aquaphor Healing Ointment to the areas that will come in direct contact with the mask.rsquoYou can also try an anti-chafing balm, like Body Glide which is is a favourite of Reviewed staffers who run. Apply it on areas where your mask typically rubs against your skin, like the nose, cheeks, chin, or ears.Keep in mind, too you should wash your face mask regularly in the laundrymdashand McAllister agrees. She suggests using a detergent specically for sensitive skin thats free of any dyes or perfumes.Bonus: If you have the luxury of picking and choosing your mask , McAllister says the type of fabric can make a big dference in your masks comfort. She recommends a soft cotton fabric thats more breathable than other alternatives.McAllister says once again to start with Aquaphoryou notice any irritation or discomfort. However, she advises that you speak to a dermatologistthe irritation is more severe or does not resolve with Aquaphor.And as for breakouts, our lestyle writer and beauty guru Jessica Kasparian has a few products she swears by. lsquoIf a blemish pops up, I love the Mario Badescu Drying Lotion, which uses isopropyl alcohol to dry up pimples and calamine lotion to soothersquo, she says, adding, lsquoI also love hydrocolloid patches like the CosRX Acne Pimple Master Patch set.

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

Those that belong to the pea and bean familyfor example, in summer, can store nitrogen in their roots,that can be ploughed back into the earth.Which crops make good green manures At this time of year they include mustard, fodder radish, fenugreek, buckwheat and phacelia, which can be slotted in in six to eight week gaps when the ground is cleared between crops. Some sown in early autumn, including winter beans, grazing rye and winter tares, will last through the winter and can be dug into the soil when it warms up in spring.How long do they take to grow Some, such as mustard, are fast-germinating. Two weeks after sowing youll find the ground covered with small seedlings, and after six weeks, these can be chopped and folded into the soil to add nutrients.Fenugreek is another nitrogen-fixer for summer, really fast growing and its bushy plants are great for suppressing weeds. It can be planted in late spring or summer and grown for up to three months.When do I cut them down Chop the fast-growing ones when you need the ground back. Just dig them up, chopping up the leaves and stems as you go to speed up decomposition. Leave them a few days to wilt and then dig them into the soil.Longer term crops such as alfalfa, red clover and trefoil can be left in the ground for a year and clipped from time to time to stop them from going woody. They are ideal for soil thats been overused and needs to rest.What benefits do they provide Clover, fenugreek, winter beans and alfalfa are good nitrogen-fixers, storing nitrogen in their roots, while clover and phacelia flowers are a magnet for beneficial insects, which can help pollinate crops, so leave some to flower. Italian ryegrass and buckwheat have root systems that will help break up heavy ground.When can I plant crops in the space again A few weeks after youve dug in your green manure, you can sow late crops such as onion and garlic.WhatI want to wait If you have no crops to fill the space, cover the green manure-treated bed with cardboard or landscape fabric to keep the nutrients from the green manure in, which will give you a great seedbed to sow seeds in come spring.What  can I grow to help my crops Try growing comfrey, which absorbs nutrients and minerals and can be made into a liquid feed. Just cut it down to the ground, fill a bucket with the leaves and stems of the plant, packing them in tightly and then filling the bucket with water.Set it aside for three weeks , then strain off the liquid into a container with a tight lid. When you want to feed your plants, dilute the liquid with water at a ratio of around : and feed your plants weekly into autumn."},{"url":null,"title":"gardening-10-best-gardens-visit-summer","story":"Still short of things to do during summer holidays  Why not visit some of our most glorious gardens, which have reopened to the public.They all detail the Covid- safety measures theyve put in place on their websites.

The Government is just saying, We hope that employers co-operate. I hope I win the lottery on Saturday but that doesnt mean it is going to happen.Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, was a hasty addition to the line-up. On a typical Sunday, Ridge has to make do with grabbing pavement interviews with Ministers when they are on their way to The Andrew Marr Show. This time, Mr Raab was live in the studio, at the requisite two metre social distance.No worker following quarantine guidance should be penalised by employers, he said, including by being put onto sick pay.\"If someone is following the law in relation to quarantine and self-isolating the way they should, they cant have penalties taken against them.\"As for his ministerial colleague Mr Shapps being caught on the hop, the Foreign Secretary said it showed the risks for everyone.Mr Raab could not guarantee other countries would follow Spain and be taken off the ldquosafe list.\"All we can say is weve got this Joint Biosecurity Centre, we monitor the risk in real time, we take decisive swt action and so there is an element of uncertainty this summerpeople go abroad.

The latter seems unlikely given how busy he seems to be with the modestly titled Tony Blair Institute for Global Change.

You can read what he had to say in full where in the paper, but in summary: Boris Johnson was uselessScottish Labour had been uselessand current Labour leader Keir Starmer was proving usefulIt was fairly predictable stuff for the former Prime Minister, except for the end when Ridge asked why he could not seem to wrench himself away from politics.

Therersquos a general acceptance that, rather than sharing culpability with previous generations, we are the ones at whose door it can be laid. Obviously there is a lot of truth in that, as we continue to consume oceans of gas and oil, and despoil the seas with plastic. Yet the culprits for harming nature and tipping it out of kilter can be found in centuries past as well as in the international departure lounges of our airports. We should not shoulder all the blame.Irsquom thinking, as one example in my own backyard, of James V. For all his qualities as a leader he was never as impressive as his father James IV, or even his daughter Mary Queen of Scots. Quite apart from his military deficiencies at the Battle of Solway Moss, James V is the man who introduced , sheep into the Ettrick Valley, to raise money for his ambitious plans. In so doing, he destroyed the ancient Ettrick Forest, in which he and other royals had hunted and killed stags by the barrowload. The kingrsquos flocks arrived a some point after , and it did not take them long to strip the valley of its trees. By our own times, all that was left of this magnicent haven for wildle was a handful of thorn trees and birches. The rest is empty scrubland.I learned about this vandalous act in a newly published collection of essays called A Journey in Landscape Restoration: Carrran Wildwood and Beyond, edited by the biologists Philip and Myrtle Ashmole. Unlike most of the books I read this is not about the past, but about the future. There are almost as many photos as words, but the ones that most vividly illustrate the tale are those taken of the Carrran Valley, in the hills near Moffat.At the end of last century, this was a bleak expanse of severely depleted upland, grazed almost to extinction. A winter photo from  shows it as a dreary unrelieved desert: think of a chocolate brownie and yoursquod be close, though dusted with snow rather than icing sugar. Now, after  years of dedicated work by volunteers, it is growing lush once more. Swathes of native woodland clothe the hillsides, and its increasingly rich undergrowth is attracting an abundance of birds, insects, flowers, fungi and amphibians. The range of moths alone is heart-warming. As before and after images go, the dference could hardly be more striking.Previously you would have been lucky to hear much more than a grouse cackling, or watch a buzzard circling overhead now it is like the RSNO, as a sorts of birdle, from meadow pippits to willow warblers, wrens and winchats, strike up from the branches of native trees: birch, aspen, ash, oak, willow, rowan, hazel, Scots pine and juniper.In a series of pithy pieces,  of those who helped bring about this transformation describe how they went about it. Philip Ashmole originally had the idea to recreate an area of woodland in the Borders that replicated how it would have been before humans arrived. Out of this notion the Wildwood Group was established, which later formed itself into the Borders Forest Trust. On Millennium Day, the trust took ownership of the Carrran Valley, and set to work on creating a wildwood.In subsequent years, other ecological restoration schemes were also begun, at Corehead and Devilrsquos Beef Tub, and Talla and Gameshope. Together these groundbreaking ventures began to restore an area they have named The Wild Heart of Southern Scotland. Inspired by their example, others are now following their lead across the country.Living as I do in one of the great medieval sheep rearing districts of the Borders, in the vicinity of Melrose Abbey, itrsquos not hard to see the effect  and more years of grazing have had on the landscape. As one of the contributors to this book writes, sheep are engrained in our economy and culture, and they are the main reason, along with other herbivores such as voles, deer, goats and rabbits, why native woodland planting is rare: ldquoItrsquos no mystery: sheep eat trees. As flocks expanded, their predators ndash wolves and lynx ndash were killed, so that today other grazers, and especially deer, roam and breed without any natural check.The Borders Forest Trustrsquos vision was aided by bodies like the Forestry Commission and Scottish Natural Heritage, but its core remained a motivated army of volunteers. Many of these came with scientic credentials ndash geographers, botanists, ornithologists, ecologists and such like. Others were simply determined to help re-establish wilderness in barren terrain. One weekend last autumn,  members of the Glasgow branch of Extinction Rebellion arrived at Gameshope, and in two days helped plant , trees. In the words of Anna Craigen, the trustrsquos work would been impossible without volunteers: ldquoThey are our muscles, brains, eyes, dirty hands and the true heart of the Wild Heart.What is so uplting about this story is not just the determination and imagination of those who have made all this happen, but the tangible evidence of the regeneration they have promoted. Page after page of A Journey in Landscape Restoration is filled with photos of wildle now thriving in Carrran.Amid the bad news headlines about climate change, and images of bush fires, floods and landslides, it is good to be reminded of the things being done to turn the tide. Work such as that in Carrran Wildwood not only restores nature to its rightful state, but gives a terric boost to our own depleted sense of hope.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

They are also being reminded that there is local support available to them should they find themselves to be the victims of the issue.NFU Scotland Orkney#s regional policy advisor Kerry Omand said: “If anyone finds themselves to be in this unfortunate position there are key steps that they need to take and responsibilities that livestock owners have. I believe that the public are very aware of their rights and responsibilities as dog owners, and our members need to have the same knowledge and confidence in dealing with these situations.”The legislation relating to this is the DogsAct  and #worrying# is defined as attacking livestock, chasing livestock in such a way as may reasonably be expected to cause injury or suffering to the livestock or abortion as well as being at large, not otherwise under close control or on a lead, in a field or enclosure where there are livestock.Kerry highlighted: “There is often an assumption that an attack or incident must be physical for it to be taken seriously, and that is simply not the case as signicant harm can be caused to animals without any direct contact occurring.”If farmers come across an incident of livestock worrying they should contact the police on the incident is ongoing, or dial  to report the incident, try to contain the dogpossible and gather their livestock for treatment and or retain any dead livestock as evidence. Finally, a dog must only be shot as a last resortthey cannot be contained and this should be reported to the police within  hours.Kerry added: “I completely empathise with members who find themselves in this situation, having been the victim of livestock worrying myself. This was a few years ago now, but from that experience I would encourage farmers to gather evidencethey can, in the form of photos or videos of the incident occurring. That may seem like an unnatural thing to do when you are wanting to put an end to the incident as quickly as possible, but it also crucial to have this evidence to hand.”Mark Evans, animal welfare officer with Orkney Islands Council wants to remind dog owners to ensure that their dogs are always under control and avoid going into fields where livestock are grazing.He said“If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land then the owner and or the person in charge of the dog, is guilty of a criminal offence.”Mark reiterates “Farmers should make every effort to catch the dogit is worrying livestock and it is only as a last resort to shoot the dogit is not able to be caught. This needs to be reported to the Police and to the Councils Trading Standards Service.”Orkney preventions and interventions officer with Police Scotland, Constable Simon Hay said: “The worrying of livestock can have devastating consequences for farm animals and has an obvious financial and emotional impact on farmers and their businesses.“The advice to dog owners or anyone walking and exercising their dogs in the countryside is to ensure they are under control at all times and avoid going into fields where livestock is grazing. The Scottish Outdoor Access Code says dogs should not be taken into fields where there are lambs or other young farm animals.#Police Scotland will enforce the existing legislation robustly, ensuring all reported cases of sheep worrying are thoroughly investigated and offenders reported to the Procurator Fiscal. Farmers and those who use the countryside are urged to report all incidents of livestock worrying to police on  or  in an emergency.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This person will be immediately re-tested by the nearest NHS veried lab — the Lighthouse Lab in Glasgow.  In the meantime, NHS Orkney will be tracing iniduals that the person in question has come into signicant contact with.It should be confirmed within the next three days whether this is indeed a new test-positive case — the tenth for Orkney,so.Mr Dickson said: #A number of industries use labs to undertake COVID swab tests and this labs are not validated by the NHS.#We can#t be confident that,the same test had been done in an NHS lab, it would have achieved the same result.#The interim chief executive, who is the permanent chief executive for NHS Shetland, explained that there had been a similar issue with a possible case within his home board. He added that, like in Shetland, he would be working to see whether some industries which have been testing their staff for the virus could do so through an NHS veried lab.#What we do is presume the person is positive,# Mr Dickson continued.#We kick in all the our well-rehearsed contact-tracing mechanisms and we instruct the person to self-isolate where they are.#When this happened in Shetland, the second test came back negative.

If a contact is in a high risk category, a decision may be taken to immediately test them for coronavirus.#If you do not receive a call from our contact tracing team, then basically you#ve not been in signicant contact with this inidual,# the interim chief executive said.It is not knownthis case will be included in NHS Orkney’s positive COVID cases as the original lab is not an NHS facility.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3221834.jpg--.jpg?1594293881000\n","title":"patricia ready to steer inner wheel","story":"BALLYMENA’S Patricia Perry, has been appointed as all Ireland Chairman of the Inner Wheel Organisation.

Both creations have been made by the hands of very talented local Cullybackey people.Shellinghill Park in Cullybackey has for some time been the focus of the ‘CCP In Bloom’ team. Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges.

Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing!

PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappBack to school costs are pushing a third of parents in Northern Ireland into debt, a survey has revealed. Allan PrestonTwitterEmailJuly   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailBack to school costs are pushing a third of parents in Northern Ireland into debt, a survey has revealed.Research commissioned by the Irish League of Credit Unionssaid % of parents found themselves saddled with debt, averaging £, to cover school costs in . That is up £ on last year.Parents were also questioned about how the pandemic had affected family income and their concerns for the new school term.Overall, parents spent an average of £ on primary school items - up £ or % since , with unorm costs rising £ to £.Secondary school costs dropped slightly to £,, compared to the £, burden on parents last year, with unorm costs increasing by £ to £ and school lunches costing £.Voluntary expenses increased dramatically by %, costing £ per child in primary schools and £ in secondary schools.Although % of parents considered back to school costs a financial burden, this has dropped considerably from the  figure of %.Around three-quartersof parents pay for school supplies out of their monthly outcome, with % using a credit card and % drawing on savings.Similar to last year, a small number of parentsturned to a doorstop lender or payday loan company.Cutting back on family holidays remains the biggest sacrice to pay for school supplies at %, but a signicant drop from % last year.A total of % cut back spending on extracurricular activities, with a thirdhaving to deny their children new shoes.The survey found that the impact of Covid- caused a drop in household income for a third of parents in Northern Ireland.One in foursaid feeding children at home while home schooling was the biggest extra cost.Most parentsexpect a mix of home schooling and classroom learning for the new term, while nearly halfof parents said they were worried their children have fallen behind in their studies at home with many admitting they spent too much time watching TV or with mobile devices.A further % of parents said ing to work would be a struggleschools did not reopen full time.Paul Bailey, ICLU head of communications, said it was good news that less parents felt under pressure over school costs, but urged those struggling to find cheaper forms of finance such as a credit union loan.

The industry reacted with disappointment to the UK government#s decision to impose a -day quarantine on tourists ing from Spain due to its growing level of coronavirus cases. The quarantine also covers Spain#s Canary and Balaeric Islands.TUI, the UK#s biggest tour operator, announced it is shutting around one third of its total of  stores.The decision was made following changes in customer behaviour, the firm said in a statement. Around  retail stores will remain following the closures. However, it would not comment on which Northern Ireland stores were at risk as a consultation is taking place.Tory MPs are putting pressure on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to introduce coronavirus testing at airports to cut the -day quarantine.And a group of  airlines, airports and tourism leaders - including Belfast International Airport chief executive Graham Keddie - have also called on the Prime Minister to introduce virus tests for those arriving in the UK. TUI said stores which are have reopened since the pandemic are not at risk of closure. But only one of its  Northern Ireland stores - a branch at Waterloo Place in Londonderry - have so far reopened. The shutters remain down at branches in Armagh, Coleraine, Lisburn, Newtownards, Ballymena, Craigavon, Omagh, Dungannon and Newry - as well as two branches in Belfast#s CastleCourt Shopping Centre and on Bloomfield Avenue.The chain has  stores in the Republic and is based in Germany.Andrew Flintham, managing director of TUI UK and Ireland, said: We want to be in the best position to provide excellent customer service, whether it#s in a high street store, over the telephone or online, and will continue to put the customer at the heart of what we do. It is therefore imperative that we make these dficult cost decisions, look after our colleagues during such unprecedented uncertainty and also offer a modern customer service.TUI is the latest high street chain after bakery chain Greggs and bookseller Eason to indicate that it won#t reopen at least some of its shops following lockdown.Greggs is closing three of its  stores - while Eason has shut all seven of its remaining Northern Ireland stores.Glyn Roberts, the chief executive of Retail NI, hoped TUI would provide clarication on which stores will be affected by the closure plans.It#s fair to say that this was a company which was facing a signicant challenge before Covid- due to the growth in online holiday bookings, he said.And in other businesses such as Eason which have also faced troubles before Covid, Covid- has now almost finished them off.There are not just the effects from the numbers of jobs lost in retailers, but closures like TUI and Eason also had a knock-on effect as footfall into the area is diminished.The pandemic and lockdown have had a catastrophic effect on demand for overseas holidays, with many bookings cancelled after quarantine was introduced. Yesterday easyJet cancelled a number of its flights.In a letter to Mr Johnson, the bosses of British Airways, easyJet and Jet demanded a more nuanced policy than the -day quarantine.They called for the introduction of regional travel corridors to replace the blanket requirement of -day quarantine for anyone ing from an at-risk country.Transport Secretary Grant Schapps cut his family holiday in Spain short as a result. As he ed to the UK, he defended the UK government#s decision.I very much understand, it obviously had an impact on me and my family, and I#m very, very sorry and upset for the thousands of Brits who are either away or perhaps even haven#t managed to go away this summer as well to Spain, he said.But it#s absolutely essential we acted when we did, it#s why all four nations of the UK acted together and the figures since have turned out to justy that action.We have to, I think, have a clear message and make sure we act by adding entire countries to that list for the time being.People who test positive for coronavirus or display symptoms must now self-isolate for  days as Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned of a second wave starting to roll across Europe.The UK#s chief medical officers said on Thursday that the period must increase from the current rule of seven days because of the risk iniduals may still be able to spread Covid-.In a joint statement, they said the change for those who experience the key symptoms of a new continuous cough, high temperature or loss of taste or smell is needed because of the low but real possibility of infectiousness up to  days.Their move came as official analysis said England had the highest levels of excess mortality in Europe across the first half of .Belfast Related ContentNorthern Ireland PremiumReliance on nursing temps could jeopardise patient safety in Northern Ireland: reportPatient safety could be compromised by a reliance on temporary staff to plug gaps in Northern Ireland#s nursing and midwery sector, a report has warned.Northern Ireland PremiumBelfast#s #Breastival# in plagiarism rowThe organisers of an annual Belfast festival celebrating all things breastfeeding have expressed anger after their name was used by a well-known baby brand to promote a similar event.

Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much.

On July , , Ray Cossum set off from France to swim across the English Channel. He completed the journey non-stop in a time of  hours  minutes. In doing so, he became the first Irishman to officially swim across the channel. It had been a long-held ambition for Ray. Born in Folkestone on the south coast of England in , he grew up hearing stories of people who had swam across the channel. It was an ambition he would come back to later in his adventurous le. googletag.cmd.push Ray served in the Royal Nay for eight years, five of which were in the submarine service as an escape instructor. While he was in the Navy, he was based in Derry where he met and married Bridie Loughrey, before the couple set up home and raised a family in Creggan. His love of long-distance swimming was developed and honed in the waters of Lough Swilly in Donegal where he regularly swam between Buncrana and Rathmullan. After much preparation, he decided to take his efforts to another level by attempting the channel swim he had heard so much about when growing up. googletag.cmd.push However, it was not an easy thing to achieve. He tried unsuccessfully twice to complete the swim. However, he finally realised his dream in the summer of . Almost  hours after leaving France, on July , , Ray made it back on to land near his home town of Folkstone. “I had tried to so the swim a couple of times before and on one of those times I was just a couple of miles from finishing it when I had to stop because of gale force winds,” he said. “So it was great to finally manage to swim across the channel and it was a big relief after all the training I had put in.” As a result of his success in , the local man became involved in the Channel Swimming Association which is the official body which regulates channel swims. He later went on to become vice president of the association. He remains proud of his achievement  years ago and the special relationship he has with the Englisn Channel. “I can say that I have worked as a er on the bottom of the English Channel, I have swum the channel, I was vice president of the Channel Swimming Association, I have passed through the channel in submarines, I have been through the Channel Tunnel, I have flown over the channel and passed over the channel on ships,” he said. “So I can say that I have see the channel from every angle possible.” Ray is also well-known locally for his deep-sea ing exploits. In , he bought the rights to the wreck of the SS Laurentic which sank on January ,  after striking a mine at the mouth of Lough Swilly. There were  passengers on-board the ship. Of these,  people died and only  survived. After the Laurentic sank, the Royal Navy organised a huge amount of es over subsequent decades to recover a large number of gold bars which were worth an estimated poundm in . Since buying the rights to the wreck, Ray has organised a large number of es to what remains of the vessel and had also been heavily in preserving artefacts which have been salvaged from it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Woods managed the Wolfhounds to success in  and is joined in the management team by Sean Forrest and former Derry player Karl Diamond. They will have to plan without Ruairi Hassan as his suspension from a sending off against Doire Trasna last season carries over. Woods was happy with preparations earlier in the season, the first time all the players were available with university commitments all behind them. googletag.cmd.push Aside from Conor Boyd , Richard Kingis the next oldest player ahead of the raft of young players who Woods feels are beginning to make GAA their priority. David Brolly is the latest to put his shoulder to the wheel and will be pushing for a start. That said, Woods admits he has a concern that the season could be ended in the blink of an eye with the ongoing situation surrounding Covid across the country. Adrian McGilligan is joined in the Glack management team by Willie Canning and former Doire Colmcille boss Simon Doherty. McGilligan feels the championship is somewhat of a lottery with the lack of preparation and player welfare needs to come first. googletag.cmd.push Back in the fold this year is Tommy OKane who s from a knee injury. After their attractive brand of football last year saw them romp to the junior title, this season has been dferent with football stopped in its tracks. Glack have concerns around Ciaran Carmichael, Cormac Boyle and talisman Niall McGowan ahead of the weekend. There was little between the sides in the last two championship meetings, which were both won by Limavady. It is a derby game and with both teams outside the favourites for the title, the local bragging rights will be at stake and Limavady should come through.

Getting active is good for your body and mind, and there are lots of easy ways to get active. Taking a brisk walk every day will help shed the pounds, but there is nothing better than heading out into the great outdoors to take in some of the wonderful countryside and coastal sites close to home. There are fabulous woodlands, beaches and picnic spots everywhere. And you don’t have to just go walking. Cycling has become ever more popular during lockdown and swimming in rivers and lakes is another wonderful way to get the blood pumping and improve your health. A survey taken at the start of lockdown revealed that one in four of us admitted that we were more active than before lockdown.  THE GREAT OUTDOORS: Walking helps you to stay fit and healthy This increased to one in three as lockdown continued, with combatting lockdown weight gain and helping mental health given as the top reasons many people are turning to some form of physical exercise. There is so much to choose from to keep you active from dusk to dawn. From aerial assault courses to horse riding treks, there is a massive range of outdoor family activities and endless possibilities for days out packed with family-friendly outdoor activities. No matter where you are, lakes and waterways make for not only incredibly scenic views but also cover a whole range of activities. The United Kingdom’s  National Parks also contain some of the nation’s most beautul and inspiring landscapes. You’ll find some of the best walking, cycling and horse riding locations and a whole host of other adventure activities in the spectacular parks. Add nearly  Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and you’ll find you’re spoilt for choice when it comes to exploring our famous countryside and keeping fit. NOTE: Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have dferent guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel. CHECK OUT WHAT YOU NEED TO STAY SAFE Whether you are heading for the hills, planning a coastal stroll or fancy splashing about in the sea or a lake, make sure you take time to check out what you need to do to stay safe. Visit www.discovernorthernirelandto learn more about heading outdoors safely. All you need to have a great time is a pair of shoes and a spirit of adventure Northern Ireland is a place made for walkers – whether you’re a take-it-easy rambler or a hardcore trekker. All you need is a good pair of shoes and a spirit of adventure and you’re set to go. With stunning views, rugged clfs and wide-open spaces, there’s always something to inspire you around the corner, across that river or up the next hill. The Mourne Mountains are a spectacular sight to behold, while the breath-taking Causeway Coastal Route and the Glens of Antrim feature three Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Walkers in Belfast get the best of both worlds. Colourful parks and peaceful towpaths show you a side of the city you can only fully experience on foot.  STUNNING SCENERY: Sketrick Island in Strangford Loch  The impressive Belfast Hills and Lagan Valley Regional Park delight with river paths and panoramic views. Elsewhere, the Sperrins, stretching from Strabane in County Tyrone to the shores of Lough Neagh, are one of Northern Ireland’s largest upland areas. Wild, untouched and exceptionally beautul, it is also an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. If you’re a serious walker, you’ll love the adventure of discovering moorland summits using routes such as Robbers Table and the Craignamaddy Circuit. And there are many more places to discover such as the mostly flat walks on the banks of Strangford Lough and in the Fermanagh Lakelands. Getting physical every day Adults should aim to be physically active every day. They should attempt to do strengthening activities that work all the major muscles in the legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms on at least two days a week. It is also recommended that people do at least  minutes of moderately intense activity every week, or  minutes of vigorously intense activity a week. However, people need to make sure the type and intensity of activity is appropriate for their level of fitness, and take medical advicenecessary.  KEEPING FIT: Jogging, cycling and swimming are good for your health and are enjoyable too Moderate activity such as brisk walking, riding a bike and hiking will raise your heart rate, and make you breathe faster and feel warmer. One way to tellyou’re working at a moderate intensity level isyou can still talk, but not sing. Vigorous-intensity activity makes you breathe hard and fast. If you’re working at this level, you will not be able to say more than a few words without pausing for breath. In general,  minutes of vigorous-intensity activity can give similar health benefits to  minutes of moderate-intensity activity. Examples of vigorous activities include jogging or running, swimming fast, or riding a bike fast or on hills.

One Big Field Party is being held this Sunday on a large green area beside Creggans Linsfort Drive. The event is free to attend, but donations will be collected for local musicians who have performed for free throughout lockdown to raise money for local charities and people in need. Local charity fundraisers Gavin Gallagher and Steven Gallagher have organised virtual gigs and street parties throughout lockdown with the help of local entertainers which have raised pound, for local good causes. googletag.cmd.push We always wanted to do something like this to say thank you to the local acts who have done so much during lockdown, but we had to wait until the rules had relaxed a bit, explained Gavin Gallagher. Some people have said to us that there have been a few reported cases of coronavirus recently andthat spike continues we will cancel the event. But at the minute we are taking every precaution to make sure everyone is safe, including using  security staff and a team of litter pickers, Mr Gallagher asked those attending the concert to observe social distancing rules. googletag.cmd.push We want people to come and to have a good time but we would ask that they abide by the rules. We are only here to entertain. If everyone does as the security people ask then everyone can have a good time. Lockdown has proved very challenging for Derrys entertainment community, with many losing all their income overnight. I would say about % of the musicians I know do it as their full time job and they lost everything, said Mr Gallagher. Many of those that were eligible for government support got so little that it was hardly worth their while. Despite this, they continued to gig online to keep peoples spirits up and raise money for charity. We hosted street parties across the city that made a really big dference to people in those areas. There was one wee woman of  who stood at her window crying and waving out because she was so happy and then she sent her son out with a donation of pound. Another time we heard about a woman who was turning  and we had singers up performing at her doorstep for an hour.One Big Field Party will take place on Sunday from pm to pm at Linsfort Drive.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Former Foyle College pupil Katie Smith landed her dream job at innovative Belgravia eaterie Wild by Tart last year at just -years-old. But after seven months in her new position, the restaurant had to shut for lockdown and Katie had to to leave her glamorous London le behind and move back in with her parents on the Limavady Road. Katie always had ambitions to work in the food industry and went to study at the prestigious Ballymaloe private cookery school in Cork straight after leaving school at . googletag.cmd.push My parents were really supportive of my decision, but my twin sister Abbie took a dferent route and went to Edinburgh University to study French and Spanish so in a way I can see the le I might have had, she explained. Having a trained pastry chef in the house definitely has its advantages. Im the resident chef in the house and Im doing most of the lunches and dinners, but thankfully not the breakfasts, laughed Katie. Coming from a high pressure job to being temporarily out of work was a big change of pace for Katie and she decided to launch a cookery e-book to fill her time. googletag.cmd.push I loved my job and I was learning so much from the people I was working with and then all of a sudden Boris told people not to go to restaurants and the bookings just dried up, she recalled. I remember on the Wednesday we had to close and on the Thursday I came home. I didnt expect to be home as long as this to be honest, and I like to keep busy so I decided to do something dferent. I was doing recipe testing so I decided to make a recipe ebook with my sister and donate % of the profits to a social enterprise charity Luminary Bakery for disadvantaged women in London. After the success of the ebook Katie decided to launch a pop up bakery from her parents kitchen offering brownies, cookies and pastries for pick up or delivery. As much as I love being at home Im looking forward to when things go back to normal and I can progress my career, she added. Katies recipe ebook is available at www.brilliantbake To order from her pop up bakery email katie@gmail or visit her Brilliant Bake page on Facebook.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft was dispatched and two Irish naval ships placed on standby after the skipper of the Killybegs-based fishing vessel, the Marliona, reported that a UK frigate ordered him to leave the area where he was fishing  miles off the Irish coast. It is understood that HMS Lancaster hailed the fishing vessel on Tuesday morning, informing the skipper they were commencing a joint operation with a submarine which would continue over the next three days. A maritime aircraft was sent to monitor the area where the UK warship was operating and two Irish naval vessels were redeployed. googletag.cmd.push The Marliona has since resumed fishing in the area which is west off Tory Island. Sinn Feacutein spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Defence John Brady accused the British Navy of arrogance of the highest order and of once again endangering Irish fishing vessels. Deputy Brady said: “On one level, we have the outrageous scenario of a foreign power ordering an Irish vessel out of Irish waters. On the other, we have a situation where a British warship was engaged in a joint operation with a British submarine. The disregard for Irish sovereignty is arrogance of the highest order. But, alongside this we have the endangerment of Irish fishing vessels and their crews by a British submarine. googletag.cmd.push I thought that we had left this carry-on behind with the Cold War. For decades, British submarines have infringed on Irish sovereign waters, leading to tragedy and loss of le when submarines have got caught up in fishing nets and pulled trawlers under. It is staggering and unacceptable that this flagrant disregard for the safety of Irish fishing crews is continuing. This cannot be allowed to stand. I will ensure that this incident will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet.We need answers as to why this has been allowed to happen. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has launched an investigation into the incident, and I will be in contact with the Minister to ensure that the governments response reflects the seriousness of the matter.  I also want to commend the response of the Irish Navy, which ordered Irish vessels to the area to ensure the safety of the fishing vessel in question. This incident underlines theneed to end the running down of the country’s defence forces and naval service by government.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Moville resident Enda Craig has urged local representatives to wake up and finally end all confusion over the Lough. Mr Craig made the comments following a motion at last weeks monthly meeting of Donegal County Council, where the issue of unregulated oyster fishing was raised. At the meeting in Letterkenny, local councillor Terry Crossan highlighted the environmental and visual impact an estimated , oyster trestles is having on the Lough. The Muff-based councillor asked council officials to contact the Marine Minister to engage with his British counterparts to seek to resolve the jurisdictional issues. googletag.cmd.push However Mr Craig stated that there are no jurisdictional issues between Britain and Ireland as the Crown Estate owns the seabed of Lough Foyle. The lough has been a disputed area between Britain and Ireland since the formation of the Irish Free State in . “You cant claim jurisdiction over something you dont own, its that simple,” he told the Inish Times. The Crown Estate is a collection of lands and holdings within the UK belonging to the British monarch as a corporation. Mr Craig said that the issue of jurisdiction has been settled and that local representatives should recognise that fact. googletag.cmd.push “I know that local representatives deal with numerous issues on a daily basis so they may not understand fully that Ireland has no jurisdiction over the lough at all, but it is time that they waken up and stop claiming jurisdiction over something that they dont own.” He also highlighted the feeling of unequal treatment that traditional oyster fishermen have received over the ongoing unregulated farms dotted along the Lough Foyle coast. “The traditional wild oyster fishermen look on as oysters are being harvested in large numbers on trestles on the shoreline of Lough Foyle by fishermen who are not burdened with a licence fee.” He added: “Any attempt to resolve the issue of licensing on the sea-bed of Lough Foyle without firstly taking into account its ownership by the Crown Estates is putting the cart before the horse and is doomed to failure.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mid Ulster Christian Helpline is listed in the Councils directory as a prayer line and last month distributed literature in the Magherafelt area branding homosexuality detestable onto God. The leaflet also called on those who participate in such immorality to repent and turn from their evil ways and included contact details for people to get in touch. Independent councillors Dan Kerr and Barry Monteith have also written to council management to ask that the listing be removed because it may promote conversion therapy. googletag.cmd.push The incident is under investigation by the PSNI. A spokesperson for the council said the directory listings had been temporarily removed. The online directory offers local business and services a listing opportunity and any inclusion should not be considered as an endorsement by the Council for any goods or services provided by any organisation, they said. However, given the issue which has now arisen, the directory section where community and voluntary organisations have registered their details, has been temporarily removed to allow us to undertake a review of the provision of the service in line with our equality commitments, and to take advice as required. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

To try and be on the pace on these events you have to cut where you can and carry as much speed as possible. There was a fast corner through a dip which we cut and there was a bang as we went over some stones. We didn’t think much of it as it’s not unusual to hear noises like that while cutting a corner.

Just nine days after this birthday, McErlean travelled to Italy last weekend for the European Championships to support Callum Devine, who will also race in Sundays event, and get his bearings ahead of this weekends action. Last year McErlean won the British Championship and picked up the Billy Coleman award for Irish Young Driver of the Year “This years British Championship was cancelled in June, so our plans were dashed and we had to come up with a plan B,” Josh told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push In stepped Hyundai and the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy to give him the opportunity in an event with a signicant Hyundai over it. “There are  other Hyundai R cars going, so there is a lot of competition, but it is great to get it,” add McErlean, who will be driving the same car used by Callum Devine in Rally Rome at the weekend. “It is great for the both of us winning the Billy Coleman award, from the same area and it shows you how far you can go with the backing of the Academy.” McErlean will again have the support of co-driver Keaton Williams and Junior British Rally Champion will take on one of the biggest challenges of his career so far, across nine stages on the roads of South West Italy. googletag.cmd.push Rally di Alba begins on Saturday with pre-event reconnaissance and a short shakedown stage near San Martino. The following day, nine stages lie ahead, three repeated, totalling just over  kilometres of special stage action before ing to Alba for the finish ceremony. “It will be a big step up from what I am used to,” Josh admits of this weekends Italian date. “It is something I am not that familiar with and it will be great to see what it is all about. “Callum is a good benchmark, he is from here but he has a few more years experience than me...it will be good to judge my pace off. If I can get close to his times, but we will have to build our pace throughout the rally and see how it goes.” McErlean was only able to complete one round of the series, thanks to the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic which halted motorsport across the UK and Ireland. “It gave me the opportunity to look at things in more detail and see what I would improve on, so maybe it was a good thing,” Josh pointed out. In Decemberraced in Italy, but in a dferent discipline at the Monza Rally Show. “There is some dference in racing around a track and going up a mountain road, but at least it gave me the experience of travelling the country,” McErlean pointed out. This time it is going to dferent. As well as Devine, World Rally Championship stars Ott Taumlnak and Thierry Neuville will be tough nuts to crack. “Im delighted to be able to get back to rallying again and this is such an amazing opportunity for me to be heading to Italy in the Hyundai i R” he added. Tuesday is a day of testing, before a day or recce on Friday to suss out the course for Saturdays shakedown. “Then we have the rally on Sunday, so it is a good format,” Josh feels. “A podium place would be a dream,” he adds, but is realistic. “There is a big entry list, there are three World Rally Drivers doing it so it is nearly a World Championship level event. “Monza aside, I have limited asphalt experience of the Hyundai, so I really need to be realistic about my expectations on a result. The focus is to get back into the groove again, six months out of the car is certainly not ideal but it will be pretty much the same for everyone. “I realise that gaining European experience is unbelievably valuable so we will have a clear goal on the pace we want to be at and try to stick at it throughout the day. It is a real honour to be competing out there and Im very thankful for the amazing support around us”. Andrew Johns, Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing Operations Leader, is hopeful for McErlean. “The opportunity for Josh to run at the Rally di Alba gives him a chance to compete against some of the best drivers in Europe, while continuing to develop his career and gain crucial mileage on tarmac stages,” John stated. “He will able to call on support from our customer support engineers at the rally, and hopefully come away with a good result and some valuable experience.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Just nine days after this birthday, McErlean travelled to Italy last weekend for the European Championships to support Callum Devine, who will also race in Sundays event, and get his bearings ahead of this weekends action. Last year McErlean won the British Championship and picked up the Billy Coleman award for Irish Young Driver of the Year “This years British Championship was cancelled in June, so our plans were dashed and we had to come up with a plan B,” Josh told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push In stepped Hyundai and the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy to give him the opportunity in an event with a signicant Hyundai over it. “There are  other Hyundai R cars going, so there is a lot of competition, but it is great to get it,” add McErlean, who will be driving the same car used by Callum Devine in Rally Rome at the weekend. “It is great for the both of us winning the Billy Coleman award, from the same area and it shows you how far you can go with the backing of the Academy.” McErlean will again have the support of co-driver Keaton Williams and Junior British Rally Champion will take on one of the biggest challenges of his career so far, across nine stages on the roads of South West Italy. googletag.cmd.push Rally di Alba begins on Saturday with pre-event reconnaissance and a short shakedown stage near San Martino. The following day, nine stages lie ahead, three repeated, totalling just over  kilometres of special stage action before ing to Alba for the finish ceremony. “It will be a big step up from what I am used to,” Josh admits of this weekends Italian date. “It is something I am not that familiar with and it will be great to see what it is all about. “Callum is a good benchmark, he is from here but he has a few more years experience than me...it will be good to judge my pace off. If I can get close to his times, but we will have to build our pace throughout the rally and see how it goes.” McErlean was only able to complete one round of the series, thanks to the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic which halted motorsport across the UK and Ireland. “It gave me the opportunity to look at things in more detail and see what I would improve on, so maybe it was a good thing,” Josh pointed out. In Decemberraced in Italy, but in a dferent discipline at the Monza Rally Show. “There is some dference in racing around a track and going up a mountain road, but at least it gave me the experience of travelling the country,” McErlean pointed out. This time it is going to dferent. As well as Devine, World Rally Championship stars Ott Taumlnak and Thierry Neuville will be tough nuts to crack. “Im delighted to be able to get back to rallying again and this is such an amazing opportunity for me to be heading to Italy in the Hyundai i R” he added. Tuesday is a day of testing, before a day or recce on Friday to suss out the course for Saturdays shakedown. “Then we have the rally on Sunday, so it is a good format,” Josh feels. “A podium place would be a dream,” he adds, but is realistic. “There is a big entry list, there are three World Rally Drivers doing it so it is nearly a World Championship level event. “Monza aside, I have limited asphalt experience of the Hyundai, so I really need to be realistic about my expectations on a result. The focus is to get back into the groove again, six months out of the car is certainly not ideal but it will be pretty much the same for everyone. “I realise that gaining European experience is unbelievably valuable so we will have a clear goal on the pace we want to be at and try to stick at it throughout the day. It is a real honour to be competing out there and Im very thankful for the amazing support around us”. Andrew Johns, Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing Operations Leader, is hopeful for McErlean. “The opportunity for Josh to run at the Rally di Alba gives him a chance to compete against some of the best drivers in Europe, while continuing to develop his career and gain crucial mileage on tarmac stages,” John stated. “He will able to call on support from our customer support engineers at the rally, and hopefully come away with a good result and some valuable experience.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The figure was outlined in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the local harbour.While the key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, they also examined improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.The consultants also undertook a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas, including the fish dock within the southpier. In August last year, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group set up to oversee the regeneration of the port.Cllr Curran says there are plans to deepen the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.He said consideration is also being given to creating a pontoon with finger berths adjacent to the quay wall and gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.ldquoNew investment in Ardglass harbour can help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities, said Cllr Curran. ldquoThe port plays a key part in the local economy and is at the heart of village le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Couple who met at school enjoy 50th wedding anniversary  ","story":"A LOCAL couple who met at school and whose love grew at a church youth group have recently celebrated th years of marriage.Jim and Angela Wilson marked their golden anniversary with a family party with their three sons and their wives and nine grandchildren.The Saintfield couple, who now live in Comber, married on July ,  at Saintfield Parish Church and honeymooned, like many others of their generation, at home.Angela was just  and Jim  when they got married but despite their tender years starting off married le, the happy couple wouldnrsquot turn the clock back.Retired motor mechanic Jim said: ldquoWe met at Saintfield High School and used to go the local youth club, I was in the BB and Angela was in the GB.

He said the business has been in existence since , with the amount of birds at the site remaining the same.Mr Shields said the proposal is for a ldquomodern, environmentally friendly unit and explained that he finds himself in the ldquoridiculous situation where he is trying to reduce emissions from his site by  per cent.He said this is a figure which the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs agrees with, but planners are recommending that his proposal is refused, even though it is a government target to reduce emissions.ldquoWe are looking to create efficiencies on our farm so that we will be ableto market all our eggs locally, rather than rely on the wholesale market in England where the majority of our eggs are sent, he said in the letter to planners.ldquoThis new system would give signicant benefits locally in both environmental and economic terms. Ammonia levels would be reduced by up to  percent and we would be looking to employ extra people to help with the grading of eggs and deliver them locally.Mr Shields said that he can continue with the older system which will emit a lot more ammonia, which is something that the government is trying to reduce..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Shrigley children’s sports pitches due for repair scheme  ","story":"CHILDRENrsquoS sports pitches in Shrigley are to be upgraded.Confirmation that Newry, Mourne and Down Council has agreed to carry out the work has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown.He has been lobbying for the upgrade in response to residentsrsquo concerns and is pleased that the football pitches used by young people who live in the village will be improved.Cllr Brown said that an existing boundary fence will be increased in height alongside the provision of additional netting to prevents stray footballs from ending up in neighbouring gardens.ldquoGoalposts will be painted and holes in the ground fixed as part of a general revamp to improve playing conditions, he said.ldquoFurthermore, no ball games will be allowed in the play park itself and new signage will be erected to reflect this.Cllr Brown said he was pleased that the local authority is open to improving the conditions of the pitch and also the additional measures to protect local houses.ldquoEspecially over summer, it is important for the younger members of our community to have adequate outdoor facilities where they can take part in sporting activities, he said.The Rowallane councillor added: ldquoI hope that the improved fence offers residents peace of mind as their properties and cars will no longer be subject to stray footballs.

Wersquore very lucky to have it and should make every effort to keep it going.Another resident described confirmation that the facility will not reopen this summer as ldquosuch a shame.She added: ldquoAs the only al open air sea pool left in Northern Ireland the Rock Pool ought to be celebrated and included in Discover Northern Irelandrsquos tourism landmark buildings and locations information. It should also be publicised in the Outdoor Swimmer Magazine.A council spokeswoman confirmed that the council took a decision to close all seasonal facilities in Newcastle, including both outdoor pools, due to Covid-.She said the decision was considered in the councilrsquos emergency business plan tabled at the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee meeting on June  and ratied at the full council meeting last month.In relation to the reopening of the indoor swimming pool at the Down Leisure Centre, the spokeswoman said the local authority was currently considering recent announcements by the Northern Ireland Executive on the reopening of pools and health suites and in relation to spectators at outdoor facilities.She added: ldquoAt present, these facilities remain closed until further notice.ldquoThe council is taking a phased approach to the reopening of its leisure facilities to ensure the safety of both staff and customers.

I was either three or four. My brother Garrett is a year younger than me. We moved from Strangford to Downpatrick when I was four-and-a-half and it was before that.My father had taken the two of us to watch a football match. Other than my mother, perhaps his five favourite things in le were reading, the crossword, conversation, a cup of tea and watching a game.What he wasnrsquot always great at was keeping a close eye on children in his charge. Between watching his old club play and chatting to a couple of the other men on the sideline, he didnrsquot notice Garrett and I making a sprint on to the pitch, looking for a go with the ball.It could well be that memory through the efflux of time has us causing greater disruption that night than actually was the case. In some ways I hope that our presence wasnrsquot even noticed by the players. It would be awful were that to have been the biggest influence that I ever had on a football match, although there is every chance that my high point was that warm evening in Kilclief.Unfortunately my enthusiasm for sport was not matched by aptitude. On one visit to his cousins in Listowel I was being encouraged to eat up my black pudding with the Kerry exhortation that I wouldnrsquot play football for Down without a good diet of black pudding.If only it had been that easy. The biggest problem was an unreliability and inconsistency in a ballrsquos direction of flight after it had been propelled by my foot, hand or implement. Allied to being short-sighted before my teens and having a slight frame, the portents werenrsquot good.Football was the game in the Red High and there were plenty of good footballers about. Kevan Owens, Ciaran McCabe and Patrick Kielty were in my year. Brian Burns the year behind. John Kielty the year ahead with Conor Deegan, Barry Breen, Mark McCartan and John Kelly a few years ahead.The recently-deceased Bro Charles was teaching in the school until my fourth year and every day hersquod put out a tea chest of hurleys for a lunchtime puck-about, which I often took advantage of. Bro Charles also coached a Downpatrick team and under his patient tutelage, and presumably need for numbers, I reached my sporting apogee with an East Down U-frac medal.What I did get from my father was the love of watching sport and going to matches. He brought me to Croke Park for the first time when I was six. It was the  football final. I was mesmerised by the colour and the noise. I know that Dublin beat Armagh that day but I honestly donrsquot remember that.What I do remember is that, for my only time, our seats were in the Ard Comhairle box. And they were soft seats. And I remember Down winning the minor match and them being given a big silver cup and I remember Daddy holding me up in his arms so that I could see it and it being so close that I tried to reach out and touch it.But it wasnrsquot all glamour. I still have yet to feel as baltic as I did one winter Sunday standing on a grass bank in the Marshes at about the age of eight or nine with the cold spreading from the frozen turf through the soles of my shoes and up my legs and Daddy talking and talking and talking as I futilely tried to will him back to the car and the warmth of home.Happier times included a spring and summer of going to watch club hurling matches. He was a member, along with Paddy OrsquoDonoghue I think, of a commission on the future of hurling in Down for the County Board and there were many trips to games, particularly to the Ards.As much as he loved football, in truth hurling was his real passion. Due maybe to a Waterford father. As a young man he had hurled for Kilclief and the county. Nothing better than a good game of hurling, hersquod say. Particularly one played in fair conditions on a firm pitch. He never got to the Munster final as often as he would have liked, but that was considered one of the great highlights of any sporting year.What we did get to and what from a young age what I was lucky enough to have as a highlight were the September trips to Croke Park for the hurling and football finals. Particularly the football finals. I got to see the great Kerry-Dublin battles, Kerryrsquos four-in-a-row, Kerryrsquos three-in-a-row.With a Kerry grandmother I felt some affinity to that great team. The Spillanes, Jack OrsquoShea, Paacuteidiacute Oacute Seacute, Mikey Sheehy, Bomber Liston, Ogie Moran, Charlie Nelligan. Great men. As magnicent as the modern Croke Park is, part of me will always miss the old wooden benches of the Hogan Stand.But there were green shoots beginning to appear with Downrsquos Minor All-Ireland in  followed by a narrow loss to Meath, my county of residence these last  years and more, in the  National League final. Preludes of course to theof the good old days and Downrsquos second era of greatness.I have never been at a more momentous sporting occasion than the  final.  comes close obviously, but doesnrsquot match it for the sheer joy, relief and euphoria.That match in Celtic Park is another contender. I suspect that had I been in Istanbul in  it might also have come close. I was in Cardf when Leinster came back from the dead with  unanswered second half points to win their second Heineken Cup. That too was an extraordinary day. But rsquo was in a league of its own.Those men of Kerry were heroes. But heroes in the same way as Kenny Dalglish, Alan Hansen and John Barnes were heroes. Itrsquos a very dferent thing when the heroes are your own people. The excitement building for weeks before. My father calling in favours from all over the country to secure extra tickets. He could nearly have opened a ticket agency.My seat that day was near the back of the Upper Cusack, two seats along from Paddy Doherty. Afterwards we made our way across the pitch and out on to Jonesrsquos Road to meet up with everyone  for the chat. At some ungodly hour on the Monday night the bus finally arrived into Downpatrick and the great Pete McGrath said that we beat the team that couldnrsquot be beaten.The last time that I went to Croke Park with my father was his last visit, three-and-a-half months before he died. It was the hurling final between his fatherrsquos county of Waterford and Galway.He had been there in  and  when they had won their two All-Irelands. He had spent childhood holidays with cousins near Dungarvan, which is where he had learnt to speak Irish. In  he had a lt by horse and cart into Tramore for the train to Dublin to watch the match.His lungs werenrsquot great at that point and I think he had greater clarity than the rest of us about how long was left. He had said to me one evening in France the month before, ldquoYou know that this is going to do for me. I knew it was, but I thought there was still a good bit leftto go.It was  years since he had brought me that first time to Croke Park when we saw Down win an All-Ireland. It would have been nice symmetry had Waterford won on his last visit but it wasnrsquot to be. The day still finished with him standing chatting to friends on Jonesrsquos Road for as long as he was able. I was happy to have been with him on that last trip.At some point in the lsquos my father stopped driving. He was probably happier with the greater opportunity for the crossword or the newspaper. My mother drove him about, but often therersquod be a lt to a match, usually with Joe Leonard. I think he went to more matches with Joe in his last couple of decades than with everyone  combined.We had started going on holidays to France in the lsquos and by the mid lsquos, by which time he had retired as Ombudsman , he and my mother were spending most of the summer there. They loved itbut,there was one downside, he missed a lot of football and hurling.Initially he relied on match reports by telephone from any of us still in Ireland. The urgency of the reports eased as his access to the internet grew but he still appreciated a call at some point to be told how the match had actually gone.The real salvation though was when their great friends, the McQuaids from Dungannon, started to come on holidays to the next town. That in itself was a good thing, but the real boon was Jimrsquos technical wizardry and ability to use a satellite dish to get RTEacute. Thereafter Jim and Maurice spent many Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons watching Jimrsquos television.I donrsquot know when I first knew of the great feats of the lsquos. I donrsquot ever remember not knowing. Whether it was the flag that my mother kept in the house with ldquoUp Down stitched across it that she had made for one of her brothers in  that my brothers and I loved to take out and wave in the garden.Or my fatherrsquos watch that had been given to him by Brian McCartan and Charlie Carr, which was engraved ldquoTo Maurice Hayes, Secretary of the Down All Ireland Football Team . From B. and C., which fascinated us as children. A watch he wore for the rest of his le and which I am wearing now as I write this.That watch made it clear that this had been something of very great import. I often think of James McCartanrsquos story of meeting his father on Jonesrsquos Road after the  final. His father was in floods of tears and said to him, ldquoYou kept your promise.The names were as familiar as our own. The McCartans and the OrsquoNeills. Paddy Doherty, Joe Lennon, Kevin Mussen, Jarlath Carey, Leo Murphy, Eddie McKay, Tony Hadden, George Lavery, Breen Morgan, Pat Rice, Patsy OrsquoHagan, PJ McElroy, John Smith and Kieran Denvir along with names like John Murphy, Peter Rooney, Larry Powell, Danny Kelly, Ray McConville, Jim Milligan and the great Colm McAlarney from later in the decade.As a boy, when people heard that I was a Hayes, Irsquod at times be askedI was Mauricersquos son and then told that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland but for him. And when Irsquod ask him about it hersquod say that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland without the players, that hersquod never kicked a ball.He spent the best part of six decades holding those men in the highest esteem, as footballers, as people, and as friends. His view was that every one of them had lived constructive lives in which they had contributed to their families, their communities and to society.And for all their achievements, they were modest men. Paddy Doherty recently selected his best Down team of all time for the Down Recorder. He didnrsquot pick himself. Paddy lsquoMorsquo is the only person in the entire country that wouldnrsquot have Paddy lsquoMorsquo on that team.Above all, he loved their company. He loved meeting up with them over the years at matches and ious s. Usually wearing his Club Down tie. Part of the pleasure of going to a match was the half-time cup of tea and the chat with friends afterwards, whether on Jonesrsquos Road, in Newry or whatever ground the match was in.There are two photographs from the GAA Congress in Newcastle ten years ago that show it well. One is a formal photograph with President McAleese and ious dignitaries. Hersquos sitting at the bottom left deep in conversation with Kevin Mussen.In the other, therersquos a group standing on a set of steps. Hersquos at the back having a chat with James McCartan. I think that Bobbie Hanvey was one of the only people that could get him to look into a camera.A third photograph from that Congress showed him standing in front of the huge poster of the  team calling them ldquoThe History Makers. That photograph was used on his memorial card. When it came to his funeral, he was buried in his Club Down tie. Nothing  would have been appropriate.His last visitor before he died was Dr Walsh, who held his hand and chatted to him. Their last words together were, ldquoWe had good times. They certainly did.This article was originally published on the Club Down website..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11643773.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And it must be. Far too long, the west of the Bann and the east has been uninvested. North and south connections are pro-car yet high speed rail is batted back.We can maximise the benefits to using Northern Ireland’s rather Belfast-centric motorways — beyond Dungannon linking to M and A N routes across to the west — and ersying the arterial network that upgrades to the Londonderry-Dublin road that have been called for for years. Picture the island as a big number  — a northern circle and a southern equivalent, meeting at a middle band: it challenges the very Dublin m-way focus of sprigs out. Same in Northern Ireland. A super-infra project connecting Scotland feeds our need to invest in whole-island rather than what connects Belfast or what connects into Dublin. But I don’t want you to think about simple transport benefits. Think about our strategic challenges into the s — water and energy, automation and connectivity. The feasibility must have its core: tidal lagoon energy marine habitat and marine farming desalination and connections of the Irish and British waterways — yes canals are in this considered as an extension to coastal harbours of both Scotland and here. This is a necessity to any connectivity bridge — we owe that to this island and to the funders: the bridge must generate true strategic value and revenue, along with many of its associated beneficial connections.Yes, I am saying it must be a whole project, not simply a rail road bridge from Larne to Scotland. That is the main complaint from the detractors that it’s a vanity project.The feasibility of the bridge project must not be framed on simple logistics terms — it is a massive potential benefit across these islands. Connectivity from Cork to Berlin, via the bridge using autonomous vehicles, travelling by high speed rail, by bicycle, perhaps even by a canal or waterway. The bridge could provide huge fresh water in a testing future by desalination. It could deliver on the trials of the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon – clean, green, secure energy. We cannot limit this feasibility study’s scope.The population of Ireland and Britain is growing. We will need across these islands to find homes and space for a population the size of Belfast every year for the foreseeable future. Water, energy and jobs matter — the bridge could be part of the solution. It needs support for a full and wide feasibility: but not just as a ‘unionist umbilical’ project, but as a massive, strategic investment that willsecurity to us on energy, connectivity, water and jobs. • Robert Park advises businesses——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCross Common bridge in Dinas Powys was closed off to drivers in February , after a new access road was built and the safety of the old bridge was questioned.The council abandoned the bridge and put up red and white plastic barriers to stop traffic driving over it.In August last year, the council promised to begin the work to remove the bridge that October mdash after delays in finding a specialist contractor.Now, with the bridge still there a year later, Plaid Cymru community councillors are demanding the council act, and either remove the bridge or turn it into a footpath and clear the debris and plastic barriers.Cllr Chris Franks said: ldquoFor three years, the Vale has said this bridge has got to go. If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Box Two is to recycle foil paper and boxes, food and drinks cans, aerosols and cartons such as milk containers and plastics also. Box Three is for cardboard, glass bottles and jars.Bryson Recycling saysadopted it could mean a jobs boost for the area as well as making recycling easier. The firm already has a link with the council, collecting recycling from homes in the Armagh area.Eric Randall, Director at Bryson Recycling says: “We are delighted that the Council is considering the Wheelie Box option. Collected weekly, the latest Wheelie Box model will offer % more capacity than a standard green recycling bin.This is an image of what can be put in the Wheelie Boxes.“Wheelie Boxes are a very much enhanced version of the kerbside boxes which are already in use in the Armagh area. The boxes have a lockable hinged lid and are integrated onto a trolley with wheels, which makes them secure and very easy to use and move.“As well as providing more space for recycling, Wheelie Boxes will also mean good news for local jobs because % of what we collect using this approach is recycled in Northern Ireland. This compares to typically around % using green bins.”Wheelie Boxes are not new, , households in Northern Ireland already use them.Bryson Recycling also pointed out that two firms based in the borough, Huhtamaki and Cherry Pipes, used recyclable materials.A number of dferent systems are currently in operation across the Borough and the consultation aims to introduce a single, streamlined recycling system from next year.Eric adds: “The Wheelie Box option means local households can increase the amount they recycle every week instead of fortnightly, protect local jobs, boost the economy and play an important role in creating a local, sustainable environment for all.”To voice your opinion, check out the link on the ABC Council website here https:www.armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk green-bin-or-wheelie-box-choose-which-to-use "},{"url":null,"title":"autumn date set opening new south lake leisure centre ","story":"Manwho died suddenly on Sunday was father of a little girl‘He wore his great big heart openly on his sleeve’ mourners told at funeral of ‘legend’ Gary McConaghyNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPeopleAutumn date set for opening of new South Lake Leisure CentreA date has been set for the opening of the new south lake leisure centre in Craigavon with the multi-million-pound facility to open its doors on November .By The NewsroomTuesday, th July , : pmUpdated Tuesday, th July , : pm\"\"The largest capital project to date undertaken by ABC Council, and among the largest in Northern Ireland, the new multi-use sports and leisure complex is described by the council as a major new flagship health and wellbeing destination.Work on the facility was halted by the coronavirus outbreak.
